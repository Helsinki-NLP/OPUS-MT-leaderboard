Members of the Welsh Assembly worried they're going to "look like stupid"
There is consternation among some members over the proposal to change their title from AM'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from across the political spectrum are afraid that this could provoke a mockery.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means stool.
A board member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "receptive" to the name change, but noted that it was a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of silly or foolish.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced as the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what Members are called will, of course, be a matter for the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received broad support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Commission elected Welsh Parliament Members of WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM's are apparently proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache for chairman Elin Jones, who has to submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the meeting's working methods, including rules on disqualification of AM's and the design of the committee system.
AM's will get the final say in the question of what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will be voting on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for some time that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a claim on his territory and has repeatedly disapproved of his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the popular vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are quiet because churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Not one of them is there today."
He says the disappearance of crocodiles is understandable.
"People socialize in different ways these days," he says.
"Croatia is no longer the neighborhood's family rooms where people often go."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining shelters.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and will therefore bring even closer the day that completely closes these churches, because most of the people who move into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black community that worshipped nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Honorable John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to appoint or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Earl David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical tool."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin's has not replaced him.
What has been happening at St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would "try to transfer the costs" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors that the diocese had sent.
Some municipalities complain of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he was diving for lobster on the first day of the lobster season in California, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed closer with a group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he's calling, 'I've been bitten!
I've been beaten!"
His whole clavicle was torn open," Hammel said as he approached the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy flew to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
Lifesaver cap. Larry Giles said at a media briefing session that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams are competing with department store-type beauty walks staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and homeware decline, the larger beauty corridors in 11 stores across the country will be tested and if it's a success will be taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty is taking place as supermarkets search for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also again launching its Boutique make-up range so that the majority of products are vehemently-friendly - something that more and more younger buyers are insisting on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the discount stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores and also launched a number of Habitat points of sale since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which, according to their grocery stores, has boosted sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument about how to divide the profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store pharmacy business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain three years ago.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty courses to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands are designed to meet every need and the enticing environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an imperative beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones ran away "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes-and-accessory brand name, Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning host, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing at the last minute from their lucrative lifestyle brand business - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when TV's golden girl announced at a tense meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that her new opportunities - which are worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she could no longer spend enough time on their home clothes and accessories trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled according to initiates Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was Holly's biggest priority by far.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to take her away completely stunned everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow Headquarters ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain's most money-influencing stars, could drive the firm millions out of pocket due to the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes, and the possibility that its launch may encounter even more delays.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby formed Truly in 2016 with Capp and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard words "and then we fall in love"
He laughed at criticism he will receive from the news media for making a remark that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma "newsreader's voice."
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first talk in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have burned.
North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, more than three months after the June leaders' meeting in Singapore, that the North is not seeing a "consistent response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his convention speech.
"We are doing well with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to starting a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have this wonderful relationship."
He says his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and causing the remains of U.S. soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have nearly 200 people just standing there," Trump said as he pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
Tide wave and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international aid, which makes it a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia continues to endure, the country remains sadly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it's not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even if it was a warning of force.
At its best, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia's numerous islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's relentless infrastructure a core of his election campaign, spending squandering money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is being harassed by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from sloppy sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought with knives, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons on the streets.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri gave up for Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He ticked the ball to the left before kicking far after the goal pole.
The effort sailed high over the frame as it floated to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball tumbled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just to try to get into that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and once typed and didn't think too much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalkeeper played back-to-back to Mateo Kovacic in that play area before scoring near the midfield and scoring in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and gave in to the midfield.
With a beautiful forward kick, he then led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard crossed the defense and finished with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest goal net.
Liverpool will face Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. in London on Thursday.
Death toll rises to 832 after Indonesia's tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Numerous people have been reported to be trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake, which struck at a magnitude of 7.5 on Friday, causing burns of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street with knife stabs, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I call on anyone who was on the perimeter of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam film footage, to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman showed up at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's close relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take hours before they are allowed back in.
It has been heard that a police officer told one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block of apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to call <0x40>MerPolCC to DM, 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of September 30 as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit with 'rewriting history' dispute
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "sadness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statute that the stature of Oliver Cromwell would become a target outside the Palace of Westminster.
The image-storming of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still commemorative.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate portrayal is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is firm is that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a guardian is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Killing Pig Tears Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his of, "Yuan," was found dead with a torn blood-covered artery near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his nephew found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pighouse.
He said there was a big male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and torn," said the cousin, who was named on his side of, "Wu," quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although weird, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife deterred the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster."
"It's just playful.
They're cockies, very curious... they're not intent on hurting you.
"You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Rest of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had from 5 a.m. east time winds of 85 m.p.u., a Category 1 hurricane, on Sunday, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough across the Pacific is beginning to take shape and move eastwards to the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will start to drive heavy tropical humidity northwards to the southwestern US.
Rosa will bring rains of up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in response to the approaching trough, tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste flow and potential landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause spot-to-spot rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially across the largest parts of Arizona.
Fast floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep fogs to touch wild rivers and thunderstorms will bring violent local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall total figures of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth driveways.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains become more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next couple of days, summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to start warm in October, with widespread 80's from the Southern Low Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks on Thursday the poignant evidence of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-nap turnaround: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was beating her in drunkenness and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an enthusiastic testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people looking at offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a deciding football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion host Kavanaugh strongly backed his appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest was always high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS on Friday morning where objectors shouted at him as he tried to take a lift to a Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes smashed for a few minutes as CNN vividly portrayed how he was being beaten.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
It was said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and had closed in front of the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all later covered live hours when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he will only do so with the understanding that the FBI will look at the allegations against the candidate for next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK EM May accuses critics of 'political game' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May will appear at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the struggling.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS-affiliated WAFB reported.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
East Baton Rouge Parish's coroner's office issued a preliminary report saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praised Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police, and territory citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva resigns from area law application for his "zeal and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average past season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "beating in" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about," Wayde said.
Volcano spit as in Mexico City
When spitting out of the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and registered 183 releases of gas and ashes over 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple thunderstorms and shakings.
Social media images have shown how thin low-gas car windshields cover neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have seen an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists to commemorate independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined counter-manifestations to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by riot police, fired them with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that were usually crowded with tourists.
A fight broke out later in the day and the police had to use their clubs to keep the fight in check.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups sang "No Forgotten, No Forgiveness" on one tone in confrontation with the unionist shouting of "Long Live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the marches, the local press reported.
The tension continues to run high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum by Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent, but participation was low, with those opposed to secession who largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried in violent clashes to prevent the vote from continuing at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful of the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
"I saw my parents cry for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital but scrupulous victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-imposed exile or in pre-trial detention for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of unhappiness.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would stand in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to disapprove of the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car crashes home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded on Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at some stage after the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Advancing Livigston stunned Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was proof of the difference when Gary Holt's team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerrard's team stayed in the Premiership without a win this season and will face the forerunners Heart next week, who are ahead of their eight points.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their unconquered run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still not having experienced a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against bot visitors
Holt's team must have been ahead long before they scored a goal, with their bustiness bringing Rangers all kinds of problems to their necks.
SR broke through, but drummed in front of the goal box, then AL could only play wide after he came closer and met CH's headshot across the goal box.
The hosts were pleased to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with deadplay moments.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
Rangers surrendered a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson joining forces for Menga to kick and score a goal from the center of the frame.
By then, Rangers had dominated possession but could not penetrate the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a reversal from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow tapped wide to avoid another open game from Livingston.
Crossings repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly blocked it, while two penalty claims – following Halkett’s challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball – were rejected.
‘Phenomenal’ by Livingston – Decomposition
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a great game for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceeded expectations on this upward lane.
Their game style and team has remained almost unchanged since their return to first-class, but a lot of honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his magnificent defense ranking while Menga kept on their toes for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they couldn't uphold those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they were able to penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find them in middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) when leaders from Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have had an outage on issues that include human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan is due to open a new mosque in Cologne.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also made their voices thick and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The fighting demonstrations reflect the divisions of a visitor who is greeted as a hero by some German Turks and stigmatized as autocratic by others.
Deptford paddock accident: cyclist dies in car collision
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision occurred around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died at the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-tap in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's crash occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Road closures and bus detours are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six custodians injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security man's prison, the prison office said.
The riot erupted around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday and is still underway at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "tornado keepers" were summoned to deal with the riot, which included eight prisoners and was confined to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to pay attention to an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and will be able to stay behind bars for longer."
HMP Long Martin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison's chief sailor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were summoned to pay attention to serious disorder during which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kit Floods (Drought Areas Trek Perhaps Advantage)
It's uncommon for a tropical low-pressure to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert and creates rapid flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona as far as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and will be approaching late with rain by Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Bowl, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside of flood risk, Rosa's rain is likely to be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to approaching land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific Ocean, which is why its power diminishes.
It is therefore expected to reach the country on Monday afternoon or evening against tropical storms in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Rainfall totals from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression on Tuesday in the early morning hours and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger expected from Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening rapid floods and debris currents in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 04:00 BST.
He was taken to a hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any cell phone footage of what happened to emerge.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered under the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered under the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, heartfeltly and emotionally denied a claim made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most capable legal spirits of our time, a jurist with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not standing, but I'm standing," he said.
That's why I'm fighting for these candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first major Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian shaking, tsunami, with figures still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a party on the beach when waves of up to six meters (18 feet) high at sunset broke down on the beach, many washed away after their deaths and destroyed everything that was in the road.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-square-foot earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, said during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, stumps, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges that were distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday night, the city was shattered.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant shaking was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some victims' bodies were found trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake shell.
Communication "is completely obstructed with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it could get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami hitting Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, it can be heard as a man on the top floor of a building cries desperate warnings about the upcoming tsunami to the people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and drags buildings and cars along.
Reuters couldn't immediately explain the material.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power outages that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for emergency services only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesian tsunami deaths rise above 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, where employees were sheltered in deck shelters erected in their office's courtyard, they were passing along scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses being destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even as relief groups embark on the awful task of launching the disaster relief task, some have complained that foreign relief workers with a lot of experience are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies and personnel from overseas can only come into operation after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we can open it to international assistance, but it has no status yet."
With the dawn of the second night on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachute looming team, has trained two of the missing parachute loomers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Still of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute floating field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon relates how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated on social media among the parachute-sliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages were only answered with one gray marker, instead of two blue markers.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26 750 during refilling of ATM at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled an ATM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was emptying an ATM in an entertainment complex and getting ready to deliver more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Kanye West will change his name to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all-Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that cancelled for "emotional reasons," the program's producer said.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has already said in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'you' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, also ended up with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador has pledged never to use military force against civilians in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to seize the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where up to 300 people were killed at a time when leftist student movements took over Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities attracted youth to gangs.
U.S. needs to double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in that field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The remarks come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even though the U.S. is shorting an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced last year their plan: they aim to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we're looking for the next AI breakthrough," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the odds of achieving the next major AI achievement in the US, Lee said in an interview to CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player and later became a managing officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge, and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporate ones," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired influential people from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help boost the U.S.'s AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence that aims to engage partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Judiciary Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been under fire for the last few months.
Macedonians vote in election or country should change name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", action that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked its membership bones for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that their northern neighbor's name represents a claim in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was then only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small elevation and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A backlash in the referendum will be the first serious setback to the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigating through Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received a hand in the midfield at the start of the series.
He chased through between three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goal box.
He then pushed a toe to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
"We're glad he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League wrestling.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that game, Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before leading Sterling to the farthest corner.
The Sky Blues' front player kicked the ball into the net just before he was over the backline.
City lift Hoffenheim in Champions League Tuesday at 12:55 pm at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play pamperer against Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the always-competitive Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playing implications for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have scored at least a promoter spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to tie their first division title.
"Although we're playing for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level of any point I will face this year.
Why don't I want to take part in it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly favourable to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throw-out practice on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 knockouts in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds meetings in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
A few weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big – I’m not standing, but I’m actually standing and that’s why I’m fighting for these candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, "You see this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible way, one sees the messiness, the insidiousness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and power, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil and mean and sneaky and false."
He referred to the name of the Senate Judiciary Committee's high-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received hard booing from the audience.
"Did you hear her answer?"
Did you let out the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I’m waiting for one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It's intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I am the last person in a string of Labour Party MPs to be told that we are not welcome – all because we said what we thought.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has received similar treatments because she has boldly stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues over which Jeremy differed from previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party MP, it was exactly what Friday's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "friendlier, more benevolent" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political outlooks began expecting me to take a U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – either on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there follows a tirade of slander on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, disapproves of politics from the core, and tells me not to be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I'm actually happier than my colleagues because the remarks directed at me tend to be political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "moment of distrust" or change of selection rules, the party gets tighter.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not be so outspoken and that I'll be "oukei" then.
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, prompted by the Thatcher government’s neglect that literally dropped my state high school, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – either as a local councillor or government minister.
I've never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country heading for a Brexit that will damage all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have isn't to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voters, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political advantage will deter me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have skewed the final result slightly, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, that the home team carried and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honour to Ayr, they took their chances better than we do."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, tied by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the numbers counted and Jason Baggot scored an unintended three.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty kick, just before he scored a solo three to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, tied by Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott carried off on a portable, and from the restart, Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, goaled by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a very busy game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he shot for Climo without the ball, and from the penalty line, MacPherson hit the ball behind the approaching Ayr maul.
Climo made it through, just as he did almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goal kick and sent flank Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth three.
Still game star looks like he's starting a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star seems to be moving into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays in with old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and Kiernan seems to be getting ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant industry."
'The sea is ours': land-encircled Bolivia hopes court will reopen away to Pacific
Marines patrol a masonry-covered naval quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Naval bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are plastered with the slogan: "The sea is rightly ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout land-encircling Bolivia, the memory of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – as is the need to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the international court on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICC ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – facing a controversial battle for re-election next year – also has a lot that depends on Monday’s ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that few will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to allocate Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's ruling comes just six months after the last demonstrations shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of helping Bolivia's case, it may have slowed down over the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric tapped any remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be tremendously difficult to hold subsequent talks.
The two countries exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was extraordinarily swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he said.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless its U.S. can trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm their nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was on the floor of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the competing countries' leaders.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream image" that continued sanctions and U.S. capturing to a declaration that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the statement without Pyongyang taking significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that the country sees as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Unveils Latest Range of Large Headwear on the Road to the Shops Near You
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely repel the sun, you don't need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of lawful oversized head coverings at their SS19 collection on the treadmill that captivated the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats roamed Instagram this summer and these designers paraded their astonishing creations on the walkway.
The exquisite by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feather-like wide rim that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included gem-decorated watermelons, a magic hat, and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne has also launched a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had finished lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like scuba gear, including a snorkel and scuba goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream squirrel.
And if you continue the great fashion show, it's your happy day.
Style viewers predict that the huge hats may be on their way to the shops near you.
The oversized hats briefly follow the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two foot wide rim seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread across social has sent another great creation across the board – a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-dressed model that wore it.
The roasted orange raffia bag, finished with raffia frills and finished with a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags appearing in stores for next summer - as the designer has made such a huge impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessory."
John Edward: Language Skills Essential for World Citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a zipper of achievements of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community businesses.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their position as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see world languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as subject choices, have the same standing as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Occupations and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons employees provide for struggling to fill jobs, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
This is why language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically place a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That's why it's so important to have children in today's classroom.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff that are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the exact number of minutes he's going to play still needs to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-season matches at this stage in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia meeting time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a wave of elections tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five scheduled gatherings in the coming week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently withheld for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when it is voted in November.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how does one look online after that?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's gathering in West Virginia via live stream below.
Trump is likely to pay attention to this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over sexual misconduct charges with an expected confirmation vote held back up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main point of view of these overcrowdings is to help the Republicans facing tough elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign said these five gatherings in the next week are aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and enlarge the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so critical of its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who refused to mention his name told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to the voting patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows courage for the fight to keep hope alive as they enter Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the four-game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is an overall invented sport concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like these.
Where would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went ahead with six points and now it's four, so we're carrying it as a bit of momentum, I guess," Spieth said when he ran away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and another twelve being played.
However, the Americans feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is a lot to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the mumps to the clean field and guided by his example.
That scoring celebration screams got louder as his lap progressed and he sank a critical set to win game four completely simultaneously while he and Thomas were behind after two laps with two.
His sets that won the game at 15 for them were greeted with a similar shout, the kind that tells one that he believes the U.S. team has another chance.
"You really just have to take it all out and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all the players are talking about.
Eighteen pounds to make their mark.
The only players to have more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undoubted story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unpairing but charming couple got four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't record one on Saturday afternoon about track numbers, but they also avoided one on Saturday morning about track numbers as well as during the last nine Friday mornings.
That run, and the way their energy apparently flows to and from this exuberant crowd, confirms that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can win a potential European victory when the sun falls over Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously or with different puppies.
It's still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short-cuts with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One hold over track number and two doubles on the front nine left the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they couldn't even barely get.
On Sunday, there's no one to help you out.
The four-ball and four-play teams are so exciting to keep a close eye on because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can turn in an instant.
So far, Europe has always played better as a team and has taken the lead significantly on the last day, but this four-game session also showed that the U.S. team has the courage to fight the battle that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming 10-6 ahead of Saturday's four-ball and four-game matches.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that performed unevenly in the morning's four-balls, so they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. faced more resistance in the four games and won two games, but they didn't let the backlog shrink.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, named "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to score four points after their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellently together to defeat a porridge Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and four-game and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
However, on a pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always get their sense.
Jordan Spieth, who won a major tournament three times, and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-games after losing the first two pucks.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point defeat when entering the singles, even though Furyk's team only had to play equal to keep the trophy because they already hold it.
After being second best for two days, however, it doesn't seem like they'll manage a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they won't disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions exacerbated its mistrust of the United States and that the country would definitely not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons without such characteristics.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant benevolence measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site, and pledging not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see any consistent response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" nuclear weapons removal approach that would reward North Korea if it took gradual steps, his words seemed meaningful by not unconditionally rejecting unilateral nuclear weapons removal as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim pledged to work for "the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted requests for tight international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the 'destruction of nuclear weapons first' and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even object to the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader called attention to earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings over the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: "If the party in this issue of nuclear weapons destruction were South Korea and not the US, nuclear weapons destruction in the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
The tone of Ri's speech was nonetheless dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be aimed at the U.S. landmass after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "fire arrowman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, generously praised Kim for taking steps to disarm, but he said much work still needs to be done and that sanctions still remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue diligently and unremittingly until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dry up funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him just hours later of making "gang-like claims."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon to demolish a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consistent measures."
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wants to see are security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalizing relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is letting all its undergraduate students get more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-driven "whole-day sessions."
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often uninformed when it comes to the basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of that one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this first, in my senior year?'
She said no one has ever told her how important sleep is - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, presented for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how they improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a few interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know what the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes are," Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of pride to "study all day" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students has meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough good quality sleep, a student's "secret weapon" should be to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he walked one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to endeavor for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted through electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menga defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another sarcy away daybreak when Dolly Menga's goal kicker Steven Gerrard's disunited team scored a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team wanted to score their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only conceded Gerrard his second defeat in 18 matches as manager so his team was eight points behind Hearts, leading loosely in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before rest time, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
While Rangers now fall to sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further trouble for Rangers ahead after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown off the roadside.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the Betfred Cup final.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in a nutshell with the way his well-trained team smothered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should have actually scored after just two minutes when Menga's first lap forwarded Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder took his big chance.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs subsequently found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense mate Alan Lithgow could only miss a kick at the rear goal pole.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have scored a penalty goal at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get just two shots to the target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was scarcely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a tough goal kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener may have been against the game's direction at the 34th minute, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it's just for their hard work.
Once again, Rangers didn't handle a deep staple of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cool and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the swap had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his line to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up ball long after ball.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to reverse Jacobs before Lithgow could come in wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty kick when he messed up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE CONTINUE... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
He said, "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Goodbye, it's about to crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to "See" Predator Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to 'See' and Kill Predator Cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to identify robbery cells as part of treatment
Method involves extraction of immune cells from a patient, transforming them into a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify predator cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers and called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells worked to beat a kind of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump mockery after his performance on SNL while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was kicked out of the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a protracted performance in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, he mocked the Democrats and reiterated his support of Trump.
"I talk to a white man so often and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
"Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's scam was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock tried to mock West by posting it.
West also complained to the audience that behind the stage it was made difficult for him about what he was wearing on his head.
"They pushed me behind the heights.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on."
They've bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would put on his "superman coat, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comment provoked at least twice an outcry from the audience and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there saying to the publication: "The whole studio has become deadly silent."
West was brought in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rhyme chatterer Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR PROVIDEING RESISTENCY TO THE SHARE."
Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "who he is and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe accepts and proclaims an ideology that puts my community at risk.
He is free.
"We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhyme chatterer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the being that used to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Co-rhyme chatterer, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and, of course, late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they need to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that he feels "reasonably strong" about making this issue work.
"I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What did our men learn as they grow up in relation to the problem we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that television is quite possibly responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued, "What is born and what has been taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
"Something went wrong with our young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he will not take part in any of the Game of Thrones follow-up and sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, as he says he's "ready with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this program, so that's how it gave me my future family, and my life from here on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the premises of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, representing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters wailed on Saturday against allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that the allegations are driven by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more detestable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's trial on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was related to Waters's office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of this fraudulent and false allegation - was not at all responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon provoked online criticism, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
He shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who has been accused by critics of seemingly being too angry during Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to lift Waters out of the cushions in the midterm election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he whispered.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had "notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally liable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson Spy Spotter
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new film with a British impact and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy mockery franchise - which at the time started with Johnny English in 2003 and continued struggling with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire be on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the awkward Johnny English with his peephole and rubber face renewed his license to waste everything for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film audiences.
He is, of course, the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretense of sophisticated elegance, has a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shot of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of riddles, leaving chaos behind him, who played Atkinson at one time in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two cute moments in this latest version of you.
I liked Johnny English coming to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armored robe and briefly cutting the screw blades against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is displayed, but the humor feels fairly faint and peculiarly superfluous, especially when the "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now use self-confident comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at kids rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's adversity isn't as original and focused as Atkinson's staple jokes in the persona of Bean.
The permanent thematic assumption now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a deplorable little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is an bloated and besieged character, who is already experiencing a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there are few in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been put at risk, she must call someone out of his retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some decent institution but giving lessons from the record on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English hosts a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency assignment and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an all-amaptic role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin are about to completely waste everything in Her Majesty's secret service and they come across Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister ends up under the dangerous spell of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury sailing yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy as he attempts to use a virtual reality headpiece to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
Nothing is spared for that last scene, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is pretty much like children's TV.
Reasonably mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't stop thinking: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really puts his talent to work?
Labour denies it's a plan for Britain to work a four-day week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause Brits to work a four-day week - but be paid for five days.
The party allegedly wants company bosses to transfer savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them extra day off.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend - but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say it will "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to introduce the country in favor of the workers.
Changing after a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this ambition is currently not endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to elaborate on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "beneficiaries" at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back as a Labour government can make "deductions" on the basis of alleged violation.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private sector companies to employees, who can receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican Sense. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could find anything that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Did you do this?
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice seemed to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett zealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentions could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event featuring a particularly impressive group of stars acting and having an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizens' Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances not only by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a GDP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions," such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way of raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was World Citizen with 12 years remaining to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a great way to convince people to claim a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people who feel they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, World Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped encourage global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential," and pledging to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and World citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd in April 2018 during a concert in London.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
World Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will be successful because together we have more power.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy for "Blocking" to Stop Exports of Russian Energy - Home Secretary
"If necessary," Washington could rely on its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular where it operates at the invitation of the legal government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure that their energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that sees itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The rulings come as Trump administration was on a mission to boost the export of their liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoner."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s view has provoked counter-reaction from Germany, reaffirming their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "seriously considering" standing as president in 2020, Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" standing as president after the mid-term elections.
During a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top of the sport," she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider standing for President."
Warren uttered her opinion about President Donald Trump during the town meeting, saying he "takes the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before our vote."
A poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should stand in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed to possibly stand in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has been going through since he came back, I have sympathy for other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the injury with which our soldiers are returning," she told an audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assault on a woman, interference with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend of the court law order in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members sons" abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum request on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014 that allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum without the necessary documents.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates that policy," the friend-of-the-court law assignment said.
Lawyers further argued in the lawsuit that the policies that deny immigrants access harm the U.S. economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly nervous.
"It feels very stressful," 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said as she comforted her feverish baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance arrives.
"Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, searching through saturated possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-square-foot earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulder, are resting outside Palu's Army Hospital where patients are treated outside due to ongoing strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
"I was pressed into the walls' rubble, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ad'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that praises the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador for China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily’s paid entry in the Des Moines Register — the state’s Iowa newspaper with the most sales — last Wednesday after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a complaint China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that has led to them levelling tariff limits on each other's imports.
China's retaliation rates early in the trade war were aimed at beating exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador for China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now exacerbating bullying by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seizes America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, one will find very limited dissenting voices at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing and not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers scraped away from the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women voters for interim elections with Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
While numerous top Republicans stand by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see counter-reaction during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The emotions about this are extremely high, and most Republicans are on record already indicating they want to continue with the vote.
Those things can't be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s push for an FBI inquiry on the spot would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is on the way!" as they protested in the Senate entrance portal as the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"They say it's high; it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among suburban swing-voting female voters and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't vote often because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony outlining the details of her allegation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"It has become a mess for the GOP," former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh will be put on the judiciary, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats elect, pointed out to the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more choosing the latter side.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents firmly believe or are likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they firmly believe or are likely to believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh likely or definitively joked during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's impeachment, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, is launching a start-up business that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do this now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, do-it-yourself lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional utilities.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
As of this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the utilities available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about launching an overall change whether or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was venerated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col. Vann's battalion crossed the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery," led the line forward before storming a field gun and knocking out three of the division.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never do, but something humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels honoured to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a bunch of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night watching the packed Bellator 206, just not being able to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose included 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the UK were dumbfounded when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "some sick joke."
"It is government regulation that the content was not appropriate at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," ja.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about the retransmission, I think we can probably work out something," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But our work on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of text messages sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We would limit it to five battles instead of six – as we normally do – and we tried to offer more for our fans and just went over our time.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has "inferior" feeling about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he did not go to high school before realizing that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had aired his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the year-long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than anyone else when he grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling differently, are the real things that have given me the strength and energy to achieve success."
He wanted to prove he was "something," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he's lightened his feelings because he's so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “took him offside.”
Daley was married to the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the forefront.
"I couldn't say to him, 'You're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed about for my entire life - to dive in front of my home crowds at an Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which also resonated with him in the build-up after the Olympics and still gives him chicken.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson won't be on the run and will retire from Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get his shape to keep it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12th time in the biennial event, has been withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-legged and four-legged matches.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will split his day in between to be a racist leader and work on his game on the practice bob in the hopes of correcting what matters.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the straightest driver and that's why the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long rough terrain always punishes the erring punches.
And as if the track on its own isn't challenging enough, Mickelson will face accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth game on Sunday, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles games well, Mickelson's game may be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role he had today, gave me a knock on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroes' Hall and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he would play two games.
I've put more in perspective, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the player who played the most Ryder Cup matches.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never really matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence contributed intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, taken, likes to shave the crazy, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving mad with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just a game."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won scraping," said Bjorn, in the photo, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 and was 10-6 at Le National yesterday.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You'll be full tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I'm still saying, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our team, but we're also well aware of who's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Rejoicing at how his players did on the tough golf course, Bjorn adds: "I'll never anticipate things with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there individually, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will want his players to perform better individually than they did as gamemates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk himself had already turned on both sides of that big last day, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every covert word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players on their way to that last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as was seen at Brookline, as was seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle matches.
We've put together our team accordingly and divided the men we felt, you know, would bring something magical for us tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and came in the main match against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it to the end," Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The German army's latest frigate would have been employed in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, local media reports.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the Navy in 2014, but the haunting post-delivery issues plagued this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the Fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, an arsenal of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home.
But continuing delays mean that the advanced warships – which will apparently enable Germany to project power overseas – will already become obsolete by the time they enter service, called Die Zeit.
The disastrous F125 frigate hit records last year when the German Navy officially refused to employ the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return shipment, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been revealed that the ship is drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including training the crew – also touched on an issue.
It apparently reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems that have bitten the new frigate are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the power of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy's "ships that can be deployed are on the verge of becoming redundant."
The official said the issue got worse over time because old ships were put out of service, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to bats' secret life
New research is being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by the common and soprano dwarf bat as well as the brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations on the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand indicators.
Expert clan channels of all surveys will check the regularity of the bat calls and determine which species do that.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as pasture creation and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleep and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Flesh isn't really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to point out bugs and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys and sleepplace inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to better understand what they need to thrive."
He stresses the need to search for bats before maintenance in properties is done because it is possible that unwitting destruction of a single maternity site could result in the death of up to 400 females and young and exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or prevent them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations as prosecutors prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $370,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
"I'm a lucky man and everything's fine," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the allegation, which they, according to Reuters, called "unacceptable reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had the hospital take photos of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of revenge" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the arrangement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and moved this summer, in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal, to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will "repent forever" if their car manufacturers lose
The UK "will regret it forever" if they lose their status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will have to temporarily cease production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost posts.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, said they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be disruption at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be discontinued.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications from not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what has been an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be discontinued, but warned that added costs in the long run could reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union's convener at the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have proposed an exact and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed by another week" as the dispute over nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia, and possible thwarting the right by the president.
Whether Trump is going to fire the Deputy Attorney General or not, threatening Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amidst reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not" to resign from Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Court's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for it has not yet been determined, it may be this week, I can see it being postponed by another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders hasn't held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a reluctance for TV journalists who are "effect-seeking," although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they are effect-seeking."
He said direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it a lot and you've seen us do it a lot over the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
The single-handedness is scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbound and at times bizarre appearance before journalists gathered there.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish that they will remain after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP has sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of processed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter to me, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued, on the way to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know it's a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value each staff member's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service's work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before rest time.
"He came to the edge and kind of collapsed just there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/scope of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving out of Illinois.
He was killed five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 dead.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government's plans to counteract homelessness.
The additional tax – which is beyond the current seal tax, including the higher levels that were introduced two years ago on second homes and homes bought to rent – can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly-built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens, which makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a cut in seal tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by picking up land but not using it and encouraged Mrs. May to renounce quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain's "housing disaster."
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking range of intended housing improvements, including lease controls and an end to "no-fault deportations."
He also wants to give councils greater power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it may not be right that it is just as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as well as foreign-based companies to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has turned into a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness into too great a reality."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to run Scotland"
Sunderland CEO Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I made the second team, but it was all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But as a child, I often looked for Scotland with my father at Hampden and it's something that pulls me back.
I'll be able to do that if I'm successful with club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no fear of imitating such established names at such a large club, after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured by 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
"Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club out there again."
Ross's career in management is still only three years long, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to third league and converted St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to championship title winners in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he says when he thinks back to how he took over Alloa's lead.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well enough, made a reasonable living out of it and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things a person needs to do on a weekly basis.
I'm still going through this in terms of the stress and pressures of work, but management just feels right.
"I always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it, it feels the most comfortable I've ever been in my own skin during my whole adult life."
You can listen to the full interview on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Sunday, 30 September.
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to survey.
The summer heat wave improved Britain's struggling bars' income, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking areas and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July – but receipts in restaurants were down by 4.8%, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continuing sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous month, June, when drinking spots were up by 2.8 percent, besides restaurants being hit even heavier.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-guided drinking places and bars fared better and rose more than restaurants declined.
Food-guided drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Throughout managed bars and drinking places, sales rose by 6.6 percent for the month, with food wash down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-the-house market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent year on year will be particularly difficult beyond and beyond ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only the time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring necessary relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking venues and restaurants, including new sites that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake Insta pages"
The news has increased fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of learners say they have a "main bill" to show to parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to the photo sharing site Instagram.
The news has increased fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of learners said they had a clean "main account" to show to parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who urged others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them down."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voting for athletes" on Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her far-reaching experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voter for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics under his four gold medals, is now a regular BBC expert, unable to walk after having a short-lived ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but fully recovered, re-learned how to walk and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows divides opinions online
A breast pump company shared opinions online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To celebrate the launch of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choice music video-inspired advertisement to showcase the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who are milking out.
Four real mothers dance in a shed full of straw and cows on the beat of a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen, it's not udders, it's my breasts."
The choir section reads, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the ad published on the firm's Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed response from viewers, with many saying it undercuts the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"It's a poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
"Like we have to conceive and give birth to them to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for mom and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advert is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "screaming funny" to her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I had always been breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
"It's a great product," one wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a fun ad directed at mothers who milk out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that the dairy industry praises or judges.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bra's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is dead-silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into a nursing bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are milking out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a big and provoking launch.
By drawing a parallel between women milking out and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while in an entertaining way that people can join, demonstrating the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time that the Elvis Presley has made the announcement.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the ramp for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to fierce rhetoric and policies enacted by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children on sponsorships.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be compromised by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement before Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That's why we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children faster, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to advocate their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit for relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say that concerns are raised at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more easily missed due to its size.
They added that moving the children to the tent town without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish "occupying forces" to withdraw immediately
When addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more being displaced, is "almost over."
He said Damascus will continue "to wage this sacred battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that urge refugees to stay away."
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing something that should be merely a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no rebuilding aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal deterred a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hopes that military action will target jihadists, including warriors from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who will be "exterminated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition sides to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "examining the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump won a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, a state of accusation and scandals end his presidency early.
In what undoubtedly "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is at the top of cable viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembered a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
There's a lot of fun in this chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
To eliminate is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you’re in the sixth hour of it watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” from his book “Fear”, Paul Manafort’s $15 000 ostrich-leather flycoat (“a garment thick of the hubris,” said The Washington Post’s Storm um.
I'll never watch Super Mario again.
"Parts of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he's feeding you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump show's changing cast and daily twists in the plot (such as seeking to quarrel with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode or you'll be left behind.
When I reached for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't tear him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Foreign money flows to the most exciting mid-term election races in the House
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees an influx of money, thanks to a shift in congressional districts that has now led two officials into a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district allows Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – to measure forces.
Lamb faces another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, overlapping heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally delineated in the Republicans' favor.
The race in the new 17th began with a campaign funding competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a strenuous win in a widely acclaimed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. considers penalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then backsliding
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted Congress to continue effectively putting an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the severity of the meeting for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberation on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that could happen could be the special deliberation on Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible thwarting of the court, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also suspected of focusing his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in the country's attack on our elections.
If Congress were to move into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face accountability in that body just as he prepares to go back before the voters, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peer group.
This is a bunch of axes, and with that I don’t want to imply that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – and neither is that of his peers in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, when the West only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy's relentless course is being speeded up or slowed down.
Americans are now facing multiple such turning points in the face.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year to take the president in secret and speculated about whether he was eligible for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if Brett Kavanaugh's newly requested FBI investigation is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm election for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we keep track of those tests, there is a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath cherries on that table carrying the swastika.

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimisms for Rapid Vienna
Rangers play hosts for Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a starting point for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked out there with a point.
Maybe we could have won it at the end, but an equal score is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big day in Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there's a good feeling factor to the place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the coaching is good.
Hopefully, we'll be able to push through now, sit past season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this retirement savings fear
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care unless you express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut off legal matches at the pass.
Get a health care proxy in place so that you designate a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts fulfill your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
You'll also want to pay for your finances.
You need to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are at issue, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What's the medication?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windbuks
A man was shot several times with a windbuk as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications put out of action, relief officials were unable to get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5 magnitude shaking.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were taken to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located on the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi Province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, causing nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake along the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami that struck 14 countries led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds have died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-sized island hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-square-foot earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-square-foot earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of towns and resulted in about 300 deaths.
2016: A plane shaking hit the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shaking and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed because of buildings that crashed,
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a female acquaintance's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pre-Trial facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, decided" when asked what he advocated, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that a criminal complaint has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case currently serves before Alaska's Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's behavior to PTSD as a result of his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspect in NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that caused eight people's deaths - a rare punishment not yet carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to launch an attack on a cycle path along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan to mow down pedestrians and a cyclist in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and inflicted "intentionally" serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to ask for the death penalty, filed in New York's Southern District.
Both of these charges carry possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal major jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the benefit of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "deep planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "horrible, cruel and perverse."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009 for the murder of two drug providers.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of a conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were retrofitted with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov said he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro-Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a life imprisonment debt recognition with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to “feel the heat” off Euroskeptics – as one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbanker Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK "would be out" by the time Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Ms. May faces to unite her deeply divided officers has been bolstered by pro-Roman Tories joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would push through in her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the deadlock – forcing Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said for the Loop Mean Loop convention in Solihull that he wanted to "expulse Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in control, we would have been out by that time," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must eject Chequers."
He outlined his opposition to the EU, saying, "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own bets in our own country."
Mr Bone has rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure that we are chosen in the first place.
"Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Ms. May, she added: “First ministers should keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farge said the assembly politicians had to "feel the heat" if they were on the verge of violating the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It's about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you get away with it.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country who gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour convention in the city center.
Some activists waved Tories against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour nobleman Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s an overall smart.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to "look hard after" to stand for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the middle of speculation that she might be challenging Trump in 2020.
Saturday's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump came to power.
A resident asked her if she was planning to stand for president.
Warren responded that it was "time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the very top."
Arrest made in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, L.A., on Saturday announced that a suspect was arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and was eventually killed as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, was in possession of a weapon, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 younger who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 lead last season, maintaining an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 bounce balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first and left Hamilton to drive in the very back of the bundle in traffic, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes made a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced to wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly risk-free leaving the inside at risk of endurance after a double-movement to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the jump-off grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he clung to his tyres to finish quickly and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the pits on the 44th lap, but was unable to accelerate his pass in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a tough day, because Valtteri was doing a fantastic weekend and was a real gentleman.
"The team did an exceptional job of having a one-two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad lyric.
(Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked at a convention Senator Dianne Feinstein over her insistence that she didn't lick Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing her Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in Western Virginia and did not directly address the evidence given by Ford before the Senate Law Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "simple and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the sweet thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick it?
Remember her reply... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a bit.
"No, we didn't, we didn't," he said in a statement.
Feinstein was sent the letter outlining the allegations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak had come off her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't lick her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not consider her denial good and commented during Saturday evening's convention: "I tell you what. It was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back any necessary means.
You see the meanness, the rudeness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive around to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars have reconciled for Friday's Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead by throws from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard scored Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals tied their win.
It was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost matches and then on Friday night Dundee won 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth match of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's openball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull helper, with David Rutherford providing the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break in when he threw his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again scored a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure of winning with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane could escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that an airplane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and more are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that swayed heavily at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained immobile to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to increase as many bodies are still under construction while many are still unreachable," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves reaching up to six meters ripped Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute brings in an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-market is being looted orally."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask almai from you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year in which more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after lake plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific Ocean beach lake in Micronesia said one man was missing after they said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it attempted to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said the plane landed near the runway in the lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had overrun the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane entered very low.
"It's a great thing," Jayne said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through medium-deep waters to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the airmen panicked and shouted and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that creatures working close to improving a quay also helped with an inflatable boat with the rescue to get people ashore back and forth before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in collapses of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analysts delineate timeline of night that woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis joined Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "joking because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsequence is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said some time after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information were deleted from his phone.
"He cleared her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
It's a black person?!
New York child teacher sues couple for being fired after "racist" text
A New York babysitter sues a couple for discriminatory redundancy after receiving an incorrectly addressed message from the mother who complained that she was "another black person."
The couple denied being racist and compared the case to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her dismay when she found out that the new childcare nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"Never a black person," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to me twice, however, Maurice.
After discovering her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice and said that they were doing a bad job outgoing nurse who was African-American and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks his damages up to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, though it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing so well," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to quit Maurice's employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
"We are not racist people," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you were rude with, even if it had been by mistake?"
"Your newborn baby?"
Come on now."
Plasco compared the matter to "extortion," saying that his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you just looking for a person?"
"It's not a great thing to do," said the banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion had been quick to bring the couple up on social media and hack them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
"It's very entertaining that we know of Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been fierce if his work had been rejected. He had been a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release after his death last year was "bitter sweet."
About Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-heavy man," she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he viewed Paddington's success kind of that way.
"Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was about to die and I had to say hello to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was driven to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heart lamb.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly starting to run out and leaving her system.
She died a while before it was over, and the body was about to close.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was unfolding.
I couldn't yell or cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get this together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who at the time was hurt for the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the trial she had gone.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head dropped and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad on the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys postcards have been on a Welsh bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
"They've always said that his smile has clarified any departure."
However, he quit work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Ms. Davis designed the charts, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling sick or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them."
She said his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It's cracking a hole through the family.
This breaks us apart.
We all have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still undecided as FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless investigation that had no scope - we might be able to bring a bit of unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "disintegrating" under hedged partisan congestion.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have to investigate the FBI?
Their indifference is all due to timing.
The midterm elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who through him met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What Happened After The FBI Reported Its Report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a draw and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's overlord numbers 'descend' under Kim
The number of North Korean survivors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug quoted data from the South's unification cabinet and said there were 1,127 overcrowdings last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
The vast majority of survivors from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protective demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China regards the survivors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war with each other - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centered around the strike negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed broadly to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we unilaterally will disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysteria" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted like that, they would say 'histeria,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh had been very emotional and at times he almost screamed and choked while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly disapproved of Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "ridiculous and coordinated character murder," organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's making himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to indict Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats win the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's currently on," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ommegang Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he is considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to handle it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of anger that boils over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would have said to the person she was talking to, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I am angry."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for restraint because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless rage and being grabbed at my neck by an older woman - a cold driver I was a bit afraid of - who dragged me into a stairwell.
"Don't let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they've had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an illegitimate relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, Mr. Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think about the decision very well," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Somebody called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find collections and so she made a vow that she would not enter the races unless she had raised $2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.
"Do you think I'm going to lose weight?" she wondered.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful to the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angry at sexism - that she choked.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled about how the press responded to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salve of the trade war between the US and China has been overwhelming and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 trillion) of items and effectively taxing half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated in goods and recently hit rates of five to ten percent on $60 trillion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to equate the U.S. shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
Getting Washington to stand back means surrendering to requests, but publicly meeting the US's requests would be too much of an embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure on US trade war over the long term can positively support China by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that could start an economic toll air in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the midst of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by a war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure at ground level thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore to normal the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe seals Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, plunged his T-hold in the water at the par-3 16th hole and surrendered his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shined in all his laps and has become one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, dropped 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a rough year.
So thankful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so glad to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I was able to help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch over to his compatriot John Ram, who won U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel in conquering Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old man," Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S. struggled to find the clear field throughout the weekend with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
US Captain Jim Furyk spoke on behalf of his team after a disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
This morning we had a little bit of heat in Europe.
We've scraped it.
Keep an eye out for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
