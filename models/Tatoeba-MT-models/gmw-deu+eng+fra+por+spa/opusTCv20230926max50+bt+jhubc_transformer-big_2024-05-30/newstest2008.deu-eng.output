Food is to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, inflation was higher than expected in November – after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was registered, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3%, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered Leitzins, and it considers that the cut in interest rates would favor the rise in commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment to create a spiral of inflation.
The ECB is striving to keep the inflation rate below 2%, or at least close to the 2% mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in a struggling situation: inflation has to be "arranged" in order to rule out the need for action later on.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a twelve-year record high in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the eurozone is due to the rise in food and energy prices.
MATIF wheat listings rose by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant inflation in 2007 for edible oil and dairy products.
The world market price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year – last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
Analysts expect a 3% inflation rate for the next 3-4 months, but estimate the annual average rate at 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup Reports Government Crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown significantly until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the approval for the socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
For party-loyal voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) face one-fifth (20 percent) of the vote for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry barrier: They come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters in both camps has grown by one percent.
Compared to the last low, the overall economic mood has deteriorated further - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "extremely bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it to be "pretty bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth expects an improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December found that 71% of respondents – a historic high – rated the Prime Minister’s work as “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters of Viktor Orbán accounts for 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the leader at all, compared to 27% distrust of the Fidesz party leader.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who believe that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be managed even without a change of government.
After the riots last October, if 35% of the votes were in favour of the remainder of the government and the head of government, this share today amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty", and another 20 percent would "probably" cast their vote.
By way of comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the polls "with certainty", while another 15 percent would consider their participation to be "probable".
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital day allowance.
If transferred to the group of "certainly" participants in the referendum, the share of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84 and 89 percent, respectively.
Alsoan the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area have maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trading triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets price increases of more than 1,000 HUF were registered.
After prices in the food markets "galloped off" last December, the percentage of inflation has not been drastic compared to the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it is certainly dissuasive for consumers that what they paid for in the last year is still well below 9,000 HUF, this year is not even available for 10,000 HUF.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800, the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the same level as the previous year, but prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppies have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but in Auchan there were 1kg of bread awakenings for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop to less than 200 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two liter Coca-Cola pledge bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink, including the pledge, cost only 257 HUF.
This year, however, Auchan was the most expensive in the "Napi" basket comparison, and Cora was the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 per cent compared to the Christmas prices of the past year, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 per cent.
The difference between last year’s cheapest shopping cart and this year’s most expensive was 12%, while the increase between last year’s cheapest shopping cart and current year’s most expensive was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 forints, but the increase in VAT was noticeable in prices last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has affected the trade: it seems that department stores could not quite decide which price range to apply to the individual items, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were unforeseeable.
(If the merchant plans the circulation speed of a product poorly, it can fall by substantial profits in the price range, which depends on traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price increase of the "Napi" basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forints, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 forints more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest one had a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumables in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office found a inflation rate of more than 30% over a 12-month period.
So in addition to flour, eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has risen by little more than 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to roll the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; good years are constantly being reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
Large quantities are purchased from everything, durable foods are delivered in pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning there were endless queues at the cash register in all three department stores when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multinationals complain to opinion researchers that they could not even reach the planned sales, not only in food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
Many places save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overburden of personnel - all factors that are not exactly beneficial to the containment of infections, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection.
The victim of a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but a short time later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation has not been performed since because of the bacterium that is still in the patient’s body.
By 10 December of this year, 1094 infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System from hospitals, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are dosed too high or inappropriately used, the well-responsive bacteria produce antibiotic-resistant, which spread quickly in the hospitals under corresponding conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poorly functioning immune systems, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the hospital’s daily routine.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA does not exist only where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nurses wear rubber gloves and masks during care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment," says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are examined for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rarely
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable to curbing the development or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and retirement homes, hospitals should examine the admitted patients and isolate MRSA-infected immediately.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practiced as often.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the state health insurance company for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the drug can form, but this directive is also not always adhered to by hospitals.
Among the outpatient patients or those in primary care, microbiological sampling is even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Save on Disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by nurses.
This is precisely why hand washing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted through droplet infection or contact, but in home hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient.
The rooms are even often crowded, the beds lined closely together, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately in the less financially well-off hospitals it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that actually favor the development of infections.
Such infections are shown to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs to health insurance companies, so they are being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government program.
At first glance, the program is successful - as published data show, the tendency of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Police chief was not drunk.
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXIIth district, the official opinion is now available.
The now resigned police chief of the XXIIth district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesperson for the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday, after the official opinion was submitted to the case.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he got to the wheel.
The former police chief drove his own car into Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXIIth district, driving over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked spot.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the driver has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the zebra strip, priority .)
The pedestrian died of his injuries after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office has opened its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
An additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Ministers János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements worth EUR 400 million on Friday in Budapest.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for financing transport and environmental protection projects with Cohesion Fund grants. The loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million was signed earlier. The current agreement deals with the use of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million lent.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose to Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later as part of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be spent on research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
During the meeting, the subway line 4 was also discussed.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary totalling EUR 8.4 billion.
The loan interest is EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with an 8-year delay, commission-free.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is attentive to the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who still buys the cheapest market in the EU, but it is rapidly getting more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most sought after pavement for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also in increasing demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will sooner or later attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favourable area of Russe has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office spaces offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfing paradises, attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons, as well as in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also striving for a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also prospective buyers from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or degraded houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are of great importance, but also the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group is made up of business people who invest with the aim of increasing their value in the medium to long term.
However, real estate in the capital is constantly becoming more expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been a 21 percent annual price increase.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the Six Hungarian Percents
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
A fierce debate is currently taking place between developed and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signalled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but it would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question of the conference is whether the developed countries are willing to provide both financial and technological support to developing countries in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on support for developing countries.
The adjustment fund, which is subject to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be managed by a 16-member council, which is expected to be administered by the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be seen in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured at 1990 levels), regardless of whether the "post-2012 agreement" was successfully achieved or not. The Union would even be willing to commit to a 30% reduction, provided other major industrialised countries of the world, or developing countries, are also willing to do their utmost and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the goal of the states that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its then 15 member states, had already committed to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will certainly meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly only come into force after 2012. In this case, the reduction plans set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the most recent international scientific climate change committee awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize in its UN report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and increase the Earth’s average temperature by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army Advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban on the net since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The shots filmed with miniature cameras attached to helmets are controlled at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are posted on the Internet.
Political message unavoidable
Soldiers of the Luftwaffe have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Office and Iraqi-based international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
According to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie of the BBC, this kind of propaganda is almost free of charge, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the rightful existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur shots, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored shots, also make it onto the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are talked about at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, numerous videos shot in action have already been uploaded from the war venues in Iraq and Afghanistan, but this "genre" has only recently been discovered by the British.
However, the Americans advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the freely downloadable shooting game "Americas Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas party with tombola and pogache in the ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is by no means clumsy: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a working conference where her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas mood with raffles or kicks in the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - that's how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already covered the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held this year in the Defense Department, but the ministry’s staff are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department will provide around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NAD) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are striking the lines.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs’ 4.32 million Forint Christmas party will be held in the House of the Future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected.
While the focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a raffle raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The room rent was 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the responsible persons.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 people attended the ball.
The festivities were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music for dancing.
At the request of [origo], it was said: There was no ball dress or suit requirement at the ball.
The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Self-Government are each preparing for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in their own homes for around 400,000 forints.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth officially does not invite her employees to a Christmas party, but to the conference at the end of the year.
It is expected that about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only served with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration ends with 350,000 forints.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will just kick in the hall of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas party in its own banquet hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 forints per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kick-off.
Since the beginning of János Veres’ tenure, the PM’s staff celebrate this way every year.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the minister's official speech, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture is inviting a New Year’s reception on January 20th, the Ministry’s Christmas celebration is cancelled this time.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to information from the department, the expenditure is 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, held each year, traditionally begin with a brief address by the minister and end with restrained tastings.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] inquiry, there will be no Christmas party at the Foreign Ministry or the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of the Christmas party, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not provide any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions will form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite strike starting on Monday.
A grand assembly of protesters will be held on Saturday, and the cessation of work will begin on Monday, the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act.
Strike-related, significant traffic barriers are expected, as railway traffic is almost completely discontinued, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be established, which will be responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A grand assembly of protests will be held on Saturday, and as of Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will quit work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not approve the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss the next steps.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will only be in the later evening hours, or even at midnight, to vote on the health insurance law.
The strikes starting on Monday will cause considerable traffic constraints: railway workers will quit their jobs indefinitely, in the morning most of the public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will be at a standstill.
At the same time, there will be highway barriers in one direction in many places.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have responded to the call for a strike - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period, while others planned temporary work stoppages.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian Railway M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers VDSZSZ on sufficient services, although more and more people are travelling by train just around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, BKV will strike from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. early, the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy will quit work for four hours, and the Teachers' Union, for example, the Democratic Teachers' Union, has called for strikes for 2 or 2-8 hours, respectively.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike nationwide alternately at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which is due from next year.
Request number three is that the eligible occupational groups be given access to the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer concerning the sidelines submitted by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the exacerbation of the existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Gypsies population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term.
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such a confrontation, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "Public authorities have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary contrast."
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "have significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, in particular in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember that since the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary is continually on the rise, so that since the summer of 2007, several organizations called "national self-defense associations" have been founded.
"These groups have in common the fact that they each define themselves as a civilian organization, while they openly boast of preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (disaster protection, national defense, security), citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: all this is done according to that method, which seeks to disguise various political aspirations as bourgeois initiative, based on the political and party-worship of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of association therefore serves not only to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration in court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard also represent a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighboring states, as some ultra-nationalist politicians in certain neighboring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as a confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma riots that took place in a neighbourhood of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents as an occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization is "national protection".
In their opinion, a real "gypsy terror" was felt in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state remained inactive and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And further: The initiative would have triggered a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma will also respond to the threats by organising their own protection, according to the risk warning report by Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and should risk-altering trends be recognizable, public opinion would be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are strictly regulated by law, so the practice of rearranging the working days around the holidays has now become established, but the coming year will give us fewer such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood as "holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and days off.
Unemployment days are usually church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are days without work - the latter alone so that the New Year's Eve celebraters can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are March 15, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, commemorating the Revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August we celebrate the founding of the state, on the 1st of May we celebrate the work, on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day shift" has proven itself in cases where we would work just one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before it, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finalized, has been determined for many years by the Minister of Labour in his own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and contractors, to public employees and civil servants alike.
Excluded are only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. even on holidays.
This year, the working order is only slightly confused by the holidays at the end of the year: From 24 December, life in this country will be formally halted, since most take time compensation for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the specially cancelled holiday.
Next year, more holidays will fall in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer re-dispositions during the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday the 26th of April will be a working day so that Friday the 2nd of May can be a day of rest.
The second rearrangement is related to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to work the Friday, October 24th in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be completely under the banner of holidays, after all lies and stands still from December 24th, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six dissuasive trifles to annoy workmates
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: They bring "colour" into everyday workplace life.
The only question is whether you get used to these small inconveniences, or you better take up the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstood, consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says one colleague.
Did you miss a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by perhaps calling the marketing department and confessing with remorse that you forgot to direct the message (this is the less common method).
Usually, this is done with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should consider what you can do to prepare your colleagues for truly unpleasant moments and consciously try to avoid these situations.
Borrow something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s hardly anything more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without question, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put envelopes or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more there, if you need it urgently.
Talk about the private lives of your colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who to whom, what to do?
Where and why?
You should not tie the information (or assumptions) about the private lives of colleagues to everyone's nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and tells us his innermost secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, rather than aligning the one who is not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported ill for no reason?
When you call in the office to report sick, citing an agonizing headache, because you are feeling uncomfortable at the moment, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: Your own work, irrevocable completions, projects with fixed deadlines now have to be done by colleagues instead of yourself.
So don’t play along with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not be able to get to the office the next day, or that something could interfere, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time, so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Calling, calling, calling
One is currently immersed in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud jokes of the colleagues?
Did you hear a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
You should not annoy colleagues with humming, singing, loud conversations (which you run over their heads), trampled, constant scolding or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if you are not deeply involved in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the other people's fault?
If a project is not finished on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness in others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the noisy colleagues!
It is best to confess your mistakes and apologize if others were affected.
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or make up for the missed, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and trousers: Comfortable for home, but has nothing to lose in the office!
Not even then should one dress so casually, if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Wanting to make it all right - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of all-morning traffic jams.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not spoiled us for a long time with qualitative electropop.
But now you can even see the traffic jam differently when you hear the new album from Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock is back "in" with its guitar squeak, the domestic electropop proves: there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, playing himself in the band Yonderboi, before – perhaps because a tavern does not tolerate two pipes – he started his own way.
But the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, he did not make it until he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and chose Zagar, together with Yonderboi, as almost the only trendsetter, also marketable in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but nobody was interested in whether they liked to wear this brand.
The band has reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The expression originates from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be ok, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar, the influences of rock'n'roll, are noticeable - in accordance with the zeitgeist and trends.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere at the Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - the newest from early to late pop music broadcasting mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi has successively set the earworm to the listeners with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is fine (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but they can also only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also arise from an honest motive.
The listener’s readiness to receive works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
Not only teenagers or twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more closely, because they also consider them part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see more and more of our concerts coming.
We have never written for the market.
Music is not created for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but this in turn exists only in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: if you want to please everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He is on the move as a soloist and has built his career rather in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, aside from the fact that you keep trying to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves more as team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which would then serve as a pulling horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was meant to be the finale of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to put together the choir of talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-piece choir was formed - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later christened "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls help shape it?
B. Zs.: The song had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this song needed "something".
The chord sequence has literally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically at once and frighteningly spontaneous.
I remember, I was pretty electrified at the time, but it also took the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There’s no solo part (apart from Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have their own role, they sing perfectly together and they’re no louder than the music, so their singing isn’t just accompanied by the music.
They were also on the back of the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: That they were standing behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting one’s ego a little bit, forgetting who came from where and where it is going, we simply allow these particular wings, the wings of love, to lift us up.
I would like others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creative work actually none at all, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't work for a long time, but gradually everything came together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is changing with the concerts and even now that I have "let go" the album.
Currently they are "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the song "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions for feelings of inferiority
Groundless Scammer
This is how his former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>ní banka.
Because of it, it was worth almost five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, and was certainly not incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He is mentally weak," was heard from the mouths of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
However, as the statements of Kerviel, published by the French media, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, show, he was a person who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he asserts in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros from the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who have previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe that and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I made the first half a billion, I didn't know how to explain that," Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he falsified documents so that they wouldn't get him into the scam.
He even managed to mislead his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to gradually develop his position.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90000.
He knew he would never earn as much as anyone else.
“Even when I first spoke in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigating officer.
But soon after his arrival, the first big success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by wagering half a billion euros on price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger – now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses allegedly knew about everything, or suspected it.
"As long as I made money, my eyes were closed."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the big blow came.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they come to him?
He was suspicious of a vacation.
“I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to be looked at in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (about 365 billion kroner) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion kroner comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to allocate about 100 billion kroner from the "Company and Innovation" program.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will be spent on transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Business and Innovation" programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to attract funds to innovative enterprises.
The aim is to raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries to date in the EU fund acquisition.
Nicaraguan Court Confirms 20 Years in Prison for Ex-President
A Nicaraguan court of appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud in the amount of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion kronor).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state will be behind bars again is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detention officials whether to let Alemán serve his sentence at home or whether he will have to go to jail.
Four years ago, a court ruled that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund set up by Alemán to finance his 2001 election campaign.
The budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget drafted by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year was still endorsed with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented it, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD therefore could not afford to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives quietly endorsed this traditionally little-observed, yet highly significant, law.
That's kind of paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and that is why they are paying more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past Social Democratic governments, which the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is mandatory by law, which is not only about pensions, but also about social expenditure, which the "quiet" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and fairly under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to earnings from taxes, levies, and bank loans, often inadvertently issued bonds that obliterated their town halls in excess.
In recent years, they have succeeded in paying off these debts by mass selling shares of the energy and other utility grids they received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now this source is already dried up.
Insofar as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we determine that:
For several years now, our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase that the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is constantly boasting of.
This was a unique way for their governments to get public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been much more sensible than our republic.
This is a huge disgrace, which is mainly due to the previous governments.
We are among the least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which unfortunately have been superfluously inflated to a gigantic extent in recent years.
Even though some of the nonsense populist spending passed this year prior to the elections has been eliminated, it is clear that if there is no postponement of retirement age and pension reform in the near future, virtually any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, it will remain nothing but mere administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditures.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kronor planned for 2008 would be quite superfluous if previous governments had not spent what they could in the past decade.
If we don’t really want to turn ruling politicians into mere administrative officials, then we have to be patient with this not too strong coalition government, who is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to collect in taxes and fees, wanting peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow for a gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to tackle the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will go to the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it loose for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time, after the September 11 attacks, that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to defend themselves or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
“This move aims to eliminate the biggest difficulties the economy faces, i.e. the increasing shortage of freely available capital that banks can lend,” said Bernard Baumohl, a consultant for Economic Outlook Group.
“The coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unserved loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting billions more.
“The central banks must have been really afraid of what could happen after deciding to do this,” said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he said.
Central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficulty accessing bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, potentially impacting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used in lending money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money to each other, even though the central banks of the U.S., Canada, and the UK had lowered interest rates several times during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as further lowering interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks is contributing to warming up the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, namely the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to be the most harmful to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again addressed the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the ending of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet", he pointed out that the debates of the ecologists are unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mix of government officials and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech president stressed that the topic was very important to him and that he was so committed to doing so.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
Now interested parties can read his attitude unbiased.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but he felt he had sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, capable of understanding and judging professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
The main statement of the book was the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no consensus among scientists about global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
Asked by those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads after New Year without a valid driving license.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive at all have not exchanged their driver’s license.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of lead tickets, the capital’s offices are flooded with applications, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration handles around 2,000 customers every day.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague, some 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver’s licenses.
The issuance of a new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to make the mandatory exchange by the end of the year and drive without a valid driver’s license will face a fine from January.
The offender pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also have it addressed with a warning in the case of transgression.
In case of infringement, the penalty may increase to 2500 kronor.
According to previous information, even those from the municipality can be imposed a penalty that does not drive at all.
He could, it was said, face a penalty of as much as 30,000 crowns.
The ministry already called on the offices to exercise mildness and impose a maximum penalty of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, but no one threatens a thousand crown penalty.
The driver’s license is a document where everyone can decide whether they want to own it or not.
It is not a passport that everyone needs to have, namely a valid one.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become void.
However, drivers will gradually have to exchange other types of driver’s licenses.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more driving licenses.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, who are accused of doing business together with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced their sentence by one or two years, respectively.
Initially, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years, respectively.
There is no appeal against today’s judgment, only a revision in the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this case, but he will first face the first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned to anything more.
A district court in January convicted 19 people mainly for involvement in robbery, the Higher Regional Court today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants denied the indictment from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with Berdych criminals, provided information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The gang gave Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík 30 percent of the loot.
The indictment concerns crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially for robberies, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for assumptions of office and unlawful possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with a steel core, a laser riflescope and a machine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself with many millions of crowns through their robberies.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, courts found Berdych and a number of others to be legally guilty of further robbery.
More men from Berdych’s circle have to answer in another trial, more cases have not yet been brought to court.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in custody in Ireland and are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> 12 million crowns plus legal costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, therefore disagrees entirely with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dostál said after today's hearing.
"But in order to be able to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the expert opinion that the opposing side created.
We will see if it has any meaning at all.
However, we insist that this should be in the range of hundreds of thousands for all together," stressed Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 kroner for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov family wanted a million crowns for every month they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for negotiating compensation was an expert report that the University Hospital in Prague Motol had prepared for him.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the children’s parents suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying strength and depth.
The men endured the stress situation better, even though they faced allegations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, are more difficult to cope with the aftermath of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the maternity clinic in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermáks in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the district chief of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina (Bohemian-Moravian Heights) handed over 100,000 crowns to each family in exchange for the expenses they had incurred as a result of the mistake of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they have to resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply for assistance from the carrier.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low amounts of damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came to his Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom of Wallachia".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian King", but the project had built up a team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in cooperation with the actor.
Polívka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is probably not ended and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team wanting to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka's parasitic," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
Everyone imagined this actor and comedian in the words "Walachian Kingdom".
The same is true of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
Fundraising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the reason is a dispute over money.
“After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to win parasitic at our work," he continued.
lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, this was not related to the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From an originally fun action a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then followed the foundation of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatrical performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the mere idea that Polívka made public for his entrepreneurial intentions in the show "Manege".
"The popularity of Polívka certainly helped the project of the Walachian kingdom," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> project and his team were intensely devoted to it.
The cooperation between the parties today divided lasted until the year 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to aggravate, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected until St. Nicholas' Day".
At the suggestion of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková took the lead as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an action against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> for the throne and half a princess.
This would lead to a new king.
Details and an appointment he did not yet want to reveal.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It should be something like the king's move in Wallachia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also register quietly," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages dwindle
To be honest, I was never a particular fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much worth, the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the workmanship could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The car with the name SW is a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the insufficient headroom on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly continue
I only go through the interior design briefly so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a quite successful design, where I have only objections because of the wretched middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more designer design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times when we might complain about too short seats or headrests are over.
The side support has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body here.
The aforementioned lack of headroom is also eliminated in the car.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the cargo compartment.
I have to describe it (also because of the openable rear window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with retaining straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment is 428 liters, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling car in the Czech Republic in this class, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is left behind by clearly noticeable 52 litres.
For a vacation abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positives, I have to mention the very flat loading space after folding the rear seats or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And frankly, that’s what a 1600 cubic engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
When I compare him to his counterpart at <0xC5><0xA0>koda, who sometimes looks like his exhaust is clogged with a rag, I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
But we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still going on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kroner, which is already quite a lot.
The Premium equipment of the test car once again beats with 80000 crowns in addition to book.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper release, electric windows at the rear and...
The car costs a total of 531900 kroner.
That’s a lot, but add up the extra equipment of a Fabia and you’ll arrive at a very similar sum.
So all that remains is to decide which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which causes fears among locals about the further development of local schooling.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has hitherto encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original residents increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is aptly illustrated by the case of North Kent, where the clashes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and robberies among students have been transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has already evolved to such an extent that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended herself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
Police were also forced to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two underage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bush and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us apples and pears and then uncovered his buttocks," a mother of Slovak pupils told The Times, describing another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases testify that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here looking for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holidays, it will come true if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and seductive cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, over the wide boulevards drove cars, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails to your liking.
And the cult cars of the 1950s continue to drive around in Havana today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats in the salty and damp air have long since fallen apart.
Havana, especially its oldest part, may have been severely degraded, nowhere else can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just being cleaned out, for example, Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have emerged not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a moth that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway enthusiasts.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-driven narrow-gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cute and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long since been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursions
The most important places do not leave out the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you no longer have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
Let's just mention that the Hemingway estate has a museum, which should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities fertile soil accumulated, by which even weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of the cigar factories of Havana.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought her the trade in slaves and sugar.
The richness embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road that would have connected the area with the rest of the country.
This insulation helped to keep it unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth visiting interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the "Valle of the Sugar Factory".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after dark, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Certainly this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo must overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape barely touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its World Heritage List thanks to its unspoilt nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the bay of pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the santeria, an African religion that the descendants of slaves profess, many pages could be written about.
As they say, it’s better to look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should design a concrete plan for the coming years, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan did not run according to their ideas, and in Edinburgh, Scotland, the representatives of the countries that have deployed units in the south of the country agreed on this.
In addition to the growing resistance on the part of the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO units to take more action, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and intensifying development aid.
“Afghanistan is moving forward, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is enabling residents to start developing the economy and security themselves," Des Browne, the British defense minister, told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the American army.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they call for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We'll have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop said the same thing today.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the countries involved as to whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the combat requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid newspaper "Sun" this week described the German soldiers as lazy.
"Afghan non-smokers unmasked: Germans play games while our boys fight," the "Sun" wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bildzeitung went on to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government Debt Will Fasten to 1 Billion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84,000 kronor.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to indebted itself with 159.2 billion Konen this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
As a result, within the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
A debt of 84000 kroner is owed to each Czech.
Over the entire past year, the state was in debt by more than 111 billion kroner.
So far, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not cross the threshold of a trillion kronor until 2009.
Next year’s debt should range from 900 billion to a trillion kronor,” said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, to the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, says: “We could come to exceed a trillion in 2009.
Exactly when, depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political stage changes and politicians are willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I do not expect such a change," he remarked.
Debt Grows
The national debt comes from the debt of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
Government debt is financed by treasury notes, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic debt has risen to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The government’s external debt has now risen by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt rose to 6.5 years.
Overall debt rose 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the growth is mainly in debt securities, where the growth is 20 percent.
It's bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that you can do something before pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and government debt management for 2007 shows that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion kroner for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It also includes a maximum amount of 13.3 billion kroner for the consolidation agency, a ten-billion reserve to pay pensions, 43-billion sovereign bond financing and 1.8-billion instalments for the European Investment Bank’s bonds.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British woman has been accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Mahomet, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of students had complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at Khartoum’s Unity High School, was picked up at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to pick a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school principal Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Sure, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear himself did not wear a shield with that name, but the problem is quite simply that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knows her well, and she would never have done anything that would have made her too close to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion that many of the teacher’s students share, describing her as very attentive to her students and as a person who never speaks about religion in class.
Keep in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common given second name in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of homage to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating session in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo concluded a sixth and final discussion meeting in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger explained at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, hinting that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika was commissioned by the UN in August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo’s independence at the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia has been and remains the advocate of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to unilaterally announce it if the Security Council does not decide in its favor.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations were held since Monday the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that Belgrade’s proposed plan for autonomy belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, was of the opinion that a compromise should always be sought, warning the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that there is a particular "domino effect" in a region that is still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be made solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end up as they started: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu told the journalists that the parliament of Kosovo would have the last word on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would take place in consultation with the Western countries.
Bush Seeks Agreement Between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was held in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them sign a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for peace that they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty that will clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This designation covers the three serious problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians mainly revolve around: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in today’s state of Israel as a result of the 1948 conflict.
After the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, spoke, he pledged to ensure that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations were conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to ensure that they could be concluded before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two coexisting states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has initiated a plan adopted by all Arab countries to offer peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, says the Saudi-Arab prince in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car on the Rue Louise-Michel drove towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no deployment, but was on strike, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a spokesman for the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, unlicensed, so not approved for public transport (see below), came, driven by two teenagers without a helmet, at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it disregarded its advance from the right, a police officer further explained.
The alcohol control performed on the passengers of the vehicle is much negative.
The condition of the car (bevelled fender, split windscreen, torn bumper) is evidence of the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary suicide and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the Val-d'Oise Public Security Chief Executive.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that at this stage the investigation of the IGPN excludes the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small kraft bike came relatively quickly to their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked up until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were recorded yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly circulated that the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, without providing any help to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious errors in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires further investigation and requires very careful action.
Libération met an eyewitness to these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth on the phone.
In view of the tension that quickly formed around what was happening and, it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen were taken in the car by colleagues who arrived at the scene of the accident.
According to this testimony, rescue workers arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow anyone to claim that the police did not help the young people.
First aid was provided to these young people.
The fire brigade arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police crushed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken in the context of the emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades deployed by the law enforcement forces there.
They then threw stones with which they wounded the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily detained.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were temporarily detained.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of approximately 500 arrests of opposition officials, human rights advocates and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court had been closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and in Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyers’ movement received on Monday the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency, and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf’s promise is no longer valid.
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a stand on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in a direct ballot on October 6.
The chairman of the court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s decisions, the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s pledge to take the top command of the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the call for emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to hand over his military uniform by November 15, the date of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army commander.
More than one-third of pregnancies are not planned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a 5-6% failure rate.
According to the institute, which finds that the percentage of women aged 20 to 40 who use the pill has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
At least eight out of ten births are planned carefully.
In one of five couples, even calculated precisely for the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is essential for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools crafted by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is soon to accommodate the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
So the crew’s second task was to implement a 17.5-ton solar panel power generating module that was already on the ISS in order to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began restructuring the solar panels of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like accordions, was damaged by a pinched cable about a meter long.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector even more.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to leave the Discovery space shuttle for a control walk and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was thus selected to operate the injured solar panel.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fastened a kind of rail to the damaged area.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bat, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels, which generate several hundred volts, had been conceived and crafted by the astronauts on board the station.
When the action ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before counting down his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery, expected to take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defence group announced that it will have to spend between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion to counter the backlogs of the A400M, the share EADS is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS is currently losing 4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007, referring to the backlog caused by the slow development of the engine of the A400M, which delayed the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, more than one billion of which for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The Group also states that the estimation of the new costs is related to the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS's business performance fell from 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
Choosing the status quo
On Sunday, the counting of the urns will not be exciting: the mass of Russians will choose President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very sealed campaign, it confirms its quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters on public channels, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the top candidate for the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is announcing itself.
Yesterday, when the President received the foreign ambassadors, he did not see through anything and was content to deliver a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference – his favorite issue during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without scams, he added.
From the opposition’s point of view, they have gone wrong.
It denounces an election campaign stained by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsine.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, according to his lawyer continued visitation ban.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these unexpected parliamentary elections, two far-reaching questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the almighty party United Russia, who will elect government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their destiny, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of Saint Petersburg goes even further back: in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe, bourgeois society has only developed very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has reconnected with the model of a paternalist state, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more so, since this new paternalism was followed not by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility that they briefly demonstrated after the disintegration of the USSR.
Why think about it for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to keep the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) are leading the local election lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will also not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What to consider for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why replace them?
A heavy memorabilia
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in Bad Arolsen on a total length of 27 km, have not been viewed until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and by name, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
In May 2006, the eleven states responsible for its administration – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the health status of the forced laborers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these names-related documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or intellectual disability of some deportation victims.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
Nevertheless, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
Nothing fundamentally new should be expected in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, explained in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU’s foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations on the signing of free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with trade between India and Europe already reaching <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to figures from the European Commission, India is only the EU’s ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economies and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most exported products from India, the European Commissioner explained further. The Asian and European giants exchange annually goods worth 47 billion euros and services worth 10 billion euros, this week Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, told the Prime Minister, and regrets that the new trade Manuel has not yet met its potential at the EU's diplomatic meeting on Friday.

The Bank of England Takes Notice of the Concern and Offers 10 Billion Pounds for Five Weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about curbing current recurring concerns about loan terms, and announced an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion at a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they should organize their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the conservation phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation.
The Bank further explains that this will bring 10 billion pounds (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) into circulation at 12.15 GMT on December 6th, at the property tax rate and only until January 10th.
This is apparently the first time the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its notice that it is prepared to take further action to maintain the day-to-day different interest rates of interbank loans with its base rate.
The interbank interest rate, which varies from day to day, was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has settled to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the amounts put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalty fees that have prevented the banks from using them.
According to some rumors, amplified by the development of the pound exchange rate as opposed to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums circulated by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS’s purchasing power proposals
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which equates to a rejection of the text.
The text, created in the framework of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), stated about ten measures that had been adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, most of which were 50% for the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPP floatante, a transport check or the restriction of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some heated exchanges of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s television post on purchasing power.
The leader of the MPs of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the entirety of their proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances, which had been examined by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 said on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from 8-10 August on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also taken care of the production, the licensing concessions and the organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he’s ever attended, says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life at Grand Park Chicago in 2005, after making itself prominent in the world of festivals together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events in 2007 each generated $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax days.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours is more likely to take place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, in order to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban one in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is gladly taking on the burden of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and include a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival's recording capacity is "very large," equivalent to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It’s not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no one less than the Terminator opposes it.
These attempts are part of the delegate tasks.
A politically "delicate mandate" because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where to go.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best,” he says.
Run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the advancement of the local cinema is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, though Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be featured at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also unveiled four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market ahead of a final year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks until the annual financial statements on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands with regard to the upcoming final year rally.
However, the experts are unable to make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock market is usually accompanied by a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially when serious tensions determine the current market situation.
Although other experts do not endorse such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they still note that the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, who, due to the lack of secure equity funds, mainly invest in pension funds, which is heavily affected by the trend towards high-yield assets.
Consequently, according to these experts, the stock market will have a rather lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, mainly because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible fall in the Fed’s interest rate, an uncertainty mainly attributable to the rise in crude oil price and the risk of the rise in inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The odds are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost 4% since its highest mark on November 8, with 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with nearly 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the mutual funds and the traditional subsidy of the pension fund made every year around this time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that things could change a bit this year, mainly due to the end-of-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the bridge day on Constitution Day.
According to the analyst, the price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at a near technical level, which could lead to a short-term deviation from the index values, the extent of which depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the choice of values that will drive the Ibex to new maximums.
Solana of Intermoney asserts that this year is the turn of the big values.
Among the value-gainers, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be associated with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually takes place, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
ACS has been on track to catch up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC are taking the same path, the expert said.
With regard to the increased consumption behavior during the Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine market events in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
Over the past seven years, December has only seen decline in two cases.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and simultaneously initiated the last real end-of-year rally to date.
This year, with the Ibex 35 catching up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and also a final year rally will be shown.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, as Popular is the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches to 20.30h on weekdays and to set Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The bank’s ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement in which 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for customers.
Whether other banks will join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening hours, will depend on Popular Bank’s experience.
And this is precisely the intention that Popular is pursuing with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those stores that, due to their location, are able to capture the merchant customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, as well as those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new, but changed opening hours.
To this end, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already located in business zones, while aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
For example, the expansion of the opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the stores, which is characterized by a more current, colorful design.
The responsible bank representative <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require any major investments, but was accompanied by an increased recruitment, as one branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O <0xCC><0x81>Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approximately 2500 offices.
And another 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit. These specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax stores, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to be a competitor to our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefónica, they have provisionally reached an agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking personnel.
Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time, outperforming its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this phrase, Telecinco’s managing director Paolo Vasile announced his satisfaction at the closing of the stock market, the channel he led had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that’s exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they did not fall too deeply.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This earnings reduces its previous losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the goodwill now reaches <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%), and Vocento holding only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to half at 2,193.46 million.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días magazine) to 2,518.53 million and in Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that these are two similar companies, according to Vasile.
Uncertain is still the question, to what extent we can actually operate on the exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first television channel this year with more than 1,000 million gross profits from advertising revenue, as confirmed by Guiseppe Tringali, Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the television business increased only by 0.7% (630.4 million).
Analysts see Telecinco’s performance in comparison as a key factor in the high payout ratio that the company has been able to show to date: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría initiated a 100% dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after buying 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as its parent company, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far stated more and more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already increased by buying 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced Telecinco’s profit for this year by 4% and for 2009 by 7%.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced Antena 3’s expected earnings calculation for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buy) measures a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (hold) due to the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.

Congress agrees to the MIFID directive, which came into force on November 1.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which today ended its session with the Congressional decision in the Senate on the amendments/additional amendments associated with the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congressmen and senators, who had pursued in their negotiations and votes the goal of establishing the best possible arrangement that ensures the security of investors and regulates individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market operation.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID aims to improve investor protection, increase the level of control by the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables both specialised firms and natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services firms (ESIS), the consulting firms that partner with investment and brokerage firms of securities.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral systems of securities trading and the systems for the internationalization of trading orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic players.
The law obliges investment firms to communicate the priorities of their company profile, the confrontation and the ways in which risks are handled in the market, and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Congressional Economic Commission made further changes retrospectively, with the decision that the debt securities must now be considered complex financial resources for the investor due to their high degree of risk has been confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the areas of work of graduate economists was used; 30 years after the 1977 regulation restricting the areas of work reserved for economists was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on behalf of others, does not require authorisation from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and the acquisition of customers to several investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim at comparing the location and quality of US products by disclosing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be made prematurely by applying the same approach as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the prematurely determined indicator would only serve as a benchmark and therefore would not have to be in line with the final result, which will be announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November is a temporary development, while at the same time ensuring that the price index will remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current number is not good, Spain’s inflation difference compared to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economics and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenue of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion over the next three years
Northern Rock’s holdings have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the UK central bank for an emergency loan due to a crisis in mid-September last year, and they are now only <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets were <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably within two and a half months due to customer confidence loss and despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money is safe, it will continue to decline until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group under the brand name Virgin Money after the acquisition, will have to contribute about a quarter of the revenue of the British banks that will be composed of the assets there over the next three years to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to invest <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 million (equivalent to about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) per year in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged involvement in urban corruption
The Spanish police have arrested this morning the current mayor of the municipality of Totano (Partido Popular), which belongs to the municipality of Murcia, on the grounds of the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo last May represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a deputy of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could, according to information from the Cadena SER radio station, be the original instigator of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged, deputy Juan Morales was arrested while leaving his client’s residence on the basis of important incriminating documents intended to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report Morales’ alleged contract payments to a Galician construction company, which envisaged the conclusion of an urban development contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a Socialists victory, to take over the office of President of Congress.
José Blanco, PSOE’s organizational secretary, and Bono announced this in the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party’s headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, the Mancha-origin politician would seem to run for the party as Congress president in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of Congress, who had announced on November 15 that he would stop running for the next general election, end his career in public policy, and instead engage in climate action in the university sector.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the prime minister had been continually pushing for his return to political affairs.
In addition, he pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, did not want to deprive citizens of who would take over the post of President of Congress in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take office, he hopes to transform the chamber into a house of respect, not of insult or shout, in order to make it more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time you get the impression that the only place in Madrid where you can’t talk calmly and calmly is Congress, and the president of the government has been interrupted in the Senate up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and hinted that he did not want to appear to have already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to relentless criticism from both the skeptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront in this regard, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new contract with the planet.
This proposal, however, puts him in trouble explaining the actions or non-actions of his government, which have played a decisive role in keeping Spain at the forefront of the EU among the least compliant countries under the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance of the requirements, to which sectors is this due, and why has his government, which had proposed the contract with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now obliged to explain to the Spanish citizens the measures he plans to take against climate change without delay.
Which companies will be affected, what behaviour of citizens should be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and what economic consequences will result.
More specifically, who will have to sacrifice himself and pay for the saving of the planet.
However, there have been and will be no such explanations in the future.
Just because it’s about sacrificing and paying.
Because the measures that can be used to combat climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous from a strategic point of view that Zapatero was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician otherwise suitable for election campaigns does not have to speak, accuse, or demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue, decorate the meetings and inspire others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or that we can only refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor’s office and a hotel manager for suspected urban infringements, according to investigations.
The city council was detained at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in the premises of which he is to this day, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the searches that took place in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, in which it was found that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped urban development land were to be redesigned under the leadership of the Galician construction company Nuaria. This was to build 4000 apartments on the property, after the local administration illegally to it during the last legislature.
In addition, two more people were not arrested directly, but subjected to an investigation procedure, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six were presented to the judge today.
According to investigative circles are also being investigated against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend residing in Murcia are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group, the Vigo-based lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is said to have been part of the Nuaria group and received the bribe.
The investigations will be carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out eleven more searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming industry, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria sub-assembly was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the town of Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana, which was to be rebuilt, with the aim of realizing a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking lots of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, which specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of components.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the head of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18, coincidentally on the day the issue of which contained the criticism of the book of Blackburn.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school graduate who quoted in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, chairman of the Education Council for the subject of Philosophy, urged teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and suggested that Plato’s teaching be removed from the sub-level curricula for the subject of philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. The downloading of a song would be a violation of the law, which would be subject to six months imprisonment.
However, if you again rob a music business worth less than 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty will still be lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than it is to participate in a music data exchange.
Engaging in a rebellious dispute entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while data exchange entails imprisonment of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code)
E. Under Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less severe than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization has not taken place by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic footage to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, someone has raised his demands quite a bit.

My family doctor gives me one of his long, strange research papers titled: Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when the others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was compiled using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the science journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life&Brain, the activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers could see that brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct in their response and therefore received the same level; but if one of them received twice as much, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to reach such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is located in the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and a laughing eye, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died - namely ex-General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be free.
Their names are on the list, which the Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet started in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, closely tracks the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her plan to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which, in turn, depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of issuance of the driver’s license, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it must be clear what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which stipulates that the Company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged in return to submit the corresponding indemnity in the event of a loss.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance, which is composed of several factors, including age, gender, time of issuance of the driver’s license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contribution payments are due in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make less contributions, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as they tend to have fewer accidents than single persons, according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the company's conviction.
The benefit assigned to the vehicle impairs the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more often the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
We now list the most important points to consider when choosing insurance in order to be able to make not only a performance, but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds encounter numerous obstacles when choosing an inexpensive insurance, such as low driving practice and the young driving licence.
Even if it is best to take out full insurance for an ideal insurance coverage, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full insurance with excess, so that the benefits of full insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract involves the customer having to pay part of the amount incurred as a result of the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, main representative of Spain at First Europa, an online insurance brokerage company.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused to his own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you’re under 25, it’s up to you to cut insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive cautiously and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the base rate at the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in said tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depend on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it may allow itself to increase bonus payments, Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract because the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
Therefore, it is best to opt for full insurance with deductible.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving , explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice, after the fear of the beginner has been discarded.
Nevertheless, for a married customer who does not have children, it is more advisable to take out full insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the person in question also allows.
On the part of insurers, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full insurance with deductible (with an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which starts only for the third year of the vehicle.
They generally drive more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to set a higher contribution payment, notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a full-casco insurance with deductible (for an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs, which require a thorough selection to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to score for the eighth-final in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will compete next Tuesday in San Siro for the point they lack in order to reach their respective goals before the Champions League preliminary round finishes. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group while the Scots decide on their participation.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs one more to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up to Befica Lisbon with four points.
Group D’s two matches will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where he will compete for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th to enter the final, which will take place on the 16th.
This group will be finished before everyone else and the draw at Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the all-expected result, even though both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home, the Celtic Glasgow knows that if they win, they would be group first and thus have a better starting position in the quarter-finals.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be defeated in a slap by FC Shakhtar to qualify, but he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because the Ukrainians are entitled to participate in a nine-point tie; they had lost (2-1) last week in Glasgow, but could win in the second game (2-0).
So the Milanese will try to miss out on the Scots in the evening, hoping to reach the semifinals of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after being defeated in the previous season in the exact same round by a goal by Kaka in the after-play time (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the first leg.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri to win, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both achieving the round of 16 and being a member of UEFA will depend on his victory and a defeat to Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon, despite its lower position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to compete in the biggest European championship, could win third place and thus play with UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls launched their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators after the band's dissolution in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared just before their concert at GM Place de Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to watch the concert at the sold-out stadium, where a video of the band's history, which had caused a stir in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and Voodoo, which will be released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls were wearing golden armbands on stage, which had previously been given to them by Posh Spice’s husband, English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, even though the nerves of his wife, Victoria, had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star has never seen our wardrobe, so I’m really curious to see what he’ll think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 resulted in the group's dissolution two years later due to internal disagreements, expressed their nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that’s why I thought, why not; so I’m glad to have made that decision, Chisholm commented on the separation of the band that had prompted them nine years ago.
The singer also announced that the disputes had been resolved and that everyone loved each other again.
Still, many things have changed since the Spice Girls’ last joint appearance in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special Virgin Airlines machine, according to the report by the television channel CTV.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will next perform in California, San José (on December 4th) and Los Angeles (on December 5th and 7th).
They will be on stage in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute swells between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia’s natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," Ukraine's economic minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which pushed prices up dramatically.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the world’s largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the June attack on the Glasgow airport.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish State Health Service does not have an accurate idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report noted that other important checks were performed correctly on a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Controller investigated personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area as a result of the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road vehicle was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at the Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in the UK.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out checks prior to hiring foreign employees to ensure that they have the qualifications, experience and authorizations required to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency does not have the jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of the UK.
The main auditor’s report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take up criminal record extract guidelines that help employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we found clues to these checks in some personnel records, these were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would heavily follow their pre-embassy examination guidelines, but added: “Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information on the number of foreign health care workers is available.”
BMA Scotland chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in advance of hiring potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report states that current pre-embassy tests at the NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, partly because the boards had trouble identifying those employees who were on leave for an indefinite period.
The investigation further found that established control procedures were followed by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-embassy checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was concerned to carry out this work in light of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that best practices are reflected in updated guidelines regarding pre-employee check-ups by all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is scheduled for next month.
Joy Division Dominates Film Awards Ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Film.

The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 Arrested in Saudi Arabia for Terrorist Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants because of their affiliation to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil exporter said one of the cells had planned to smuggle missiles.
Al Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect facilities following a failed Al Qaeda attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing a Home Office statement, says that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile expert” who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees were reportedly planning to kill clergymen and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis striving for Iraq from joining Al Qaeda militias to fight the Allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be standing with the authorities in support of the royal family’s policies that dominate the government.
The militias – accompanied by calls by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government – have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior told state television.
The arrests also affected a “media cell” of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote “Takfiri thinking” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims supporting violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among the detainees were also 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could give a preview of the future of Earth
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit show that the planet resembles Earth’s averted twin even more than previously known.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a bit closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unrestrained carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere due to sunlight and a slower rotational pace, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has been studying the plant for a year, provide a disappointing insight into how Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express mission, said: “It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar.”
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
Enriched Uranium Seized by Police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material is being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency ultimately agreed to face a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters record questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time exactly reflected the state of the Republican Party, which is breaking up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with selecting the prospective candidate to show YouTube clips.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest one devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The issue is one of the most pervasive topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial-up when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed peaks of approval as the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed forward in the decisive polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation that he was reluctant to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two dealt particularly heavily when the questioner asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, succeeded in catching up on this issue.
None of the men have serious chances of being nominated, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have hit the immigration paws earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates generally share the same views: tighter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, help Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported weapons restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible was his favorite book, he might not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now ranked first in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was urged to ask if Jesus would endorse them, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul’s recent donation successes and his applause storms in Wednesday’s debate.
These two have been shot up out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinkle to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No noble titles seem to have been sold, no politician’s Parisian hotel bills paid, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has veiled donations to the British ruling Labour Party over more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the contested Gordon Brown would have done well.
When, two months ago, the Prime Minister evaded the call for an election, stupidly insulting the intelligence of the British, claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sagacious chairman of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once feared Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a struggling bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change tax laws have brought corporate associations against the government.
The tax authorities’ loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative misconduct.
A trio of retired generals launched an uprising in the upper house in protest against military spending cuts: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the varied donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s secretary general (and her former fulfilment manager) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably heading for resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it impossible to govern.
People neither like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for long, this delay is over: the public service is starting to leak; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In one way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The issues with Northern Rock and the tax liability records, for example, are related to decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes — like the long “money for nobility titles” investigation of political party funding — voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown’s situation isn’t quite as bad as it looks
The mistakes are not as terrible as the Conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely scammed.
And the antidote, as painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new push for political donations is a good example.
The garboske of Abraham, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be the case, but the decision was not his.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham’s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s main financial collector, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown is not involved: there is nothing that suggests he knew about these confusions, even though most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted that determination by grasping a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject – led to the full measure, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Public Life Standards, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a far-reaching reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can win is through indisputable righteousness and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis affecting America’s credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that spinal fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is sickening, the predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that the credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion spreads from underfunded loans to other forms of consumer loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both debit and debit rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its U.S. consumer finance, partly because of the weakness of credit card users.
It is too early to panic.
Losses and delays are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter margin rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in U.S. private insolvency laws in 2005 resulted in an abrupt case of bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for much of the debit card losses; the number of filings (and hence default fees) would rise again whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
The industry also reports solid payment rates showing how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
and the trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stagnation in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, expects that outputs for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take up credit card debt now that home loans are drying out.
However, the card issuers look at the money flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower’s creditworthiness.
They can even be beneficial for the card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates drop when the real estate value is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react to the more stormy conditions much faster and more flexibly than lenders by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of the assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess the loans entirely,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief finance officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and credit mitigation push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grimer future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British bankers confess guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their applications to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial scam in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The trial was scheduled for January.
But during a hearing in court before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally filed against her in 2002 pointed out to Fastow that he was the target of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The indictment against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machinations that helped pull the company into the bankruptcy swirl.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had valued its stake in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Copper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others sewed off about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiracy for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow faces a six-year prison sentence at Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on the loose due to a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States in anticipation of the court case.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh-largest company, collapsed in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer obscure billions of dollars in debt or make weakening enterprises appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than two billion dollars in retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles related to the Enron collapse.
Skilling faces a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were nullified after he died last year of heart disease.
Not all the way down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that’s change for some of the rich Russians.
“It can accommodate up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you are asking for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of exhibited consumption held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly funded Russians in everything from mahogany-panelled yachts to diamond-coated car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the nearest booth.
"This is a nice car, but it's change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas at its peak.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were seen as materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the most visible generous money issuers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private wealth in the former Soviet Union written by economic experts from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
For the first time, she had attended the fair together with the brand’s Russian retailer, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they walk through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to spend several hours in traffic jams to visit a convenient warehouse that shamelessly sidelined Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom billiard tables, Dubai apartments, and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painting of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from large-lane logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not market at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company had sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars to customer requests, said he had sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which resemble interlinked chainrings, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tyre designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-replacement.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on these wheels," Karapetian said.
“He’ll keep it in his 30 or 40 car garage.”
Even though many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who weren’t millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red phone booths with a British model, which were stuffed with mountains of fake million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaire's fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around the money piles, take mobile phone photos as they sit back amidst the substitute wealth, get clipped by friends, or just to plug in a few million.
"See, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Surgery suspected in death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance on white Cape Cod stopped two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the doctor's body inspector's van approaching," Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The hearings learned that the dead Ms. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon that police did not identify and who worked in the house at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxocological investigations, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help clarify a mysterious death that has sent mourning through the leadership of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and persistent," McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she is leaving behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators were trying to determine if Arroyo died as a result of unauthorised surgical treatment.
"That's one of the options," Walsh said.
“It’s an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro's house, where a withered rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in groceries and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him navigate the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates lead to the rise in world stock markets
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets through further interest rate cuts were reinforced by appeasing comments from the U.S. central bank vice chairman.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said that the policy must respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down annoying markets in the face of signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turmoil had “partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October.”
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The comments also helped calm Wall Street in the face of further bad news from the U.S. economy now that U.S. real estate sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost reduction measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the U.S. mortgage lending sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader-based S&P 500 Index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of UK standard values.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to European Commercial Banks was lent to a considerable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow suit and feed further capital into London’s money markets increased as credit tensions saw the three-month “Libor” rates on loan between UK banks rise at 6.59% to their highest since late September, after a steady increase since November 21.
England faced with decision on statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, on call at least under this particular title, is here to help decide on head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling with applications for national electorates, if not for those in part-time.
Whoever doesn’t get the sixth racket position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly.
It’s never easy to pinpoint exactly what allows a person to reach the top of their profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability.
It’s not just in cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time to climb Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same might also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class for a cricket player is, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or sink.
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decisions, but chances have too.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain’s eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a club must get regular chances on the order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, for example, when James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first test, even when Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind boils into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a viewing question.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at the time still struggling to solidify himself, who made the breakthrough into a major test cricketer and who, although scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion in the course of today’s network session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 top-notch hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22, and an excellent record against twisted balls.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a Middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing from his beating that was still apparent in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has shovel-like joy of life.
He is impressed by nothing on a cricket court and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently overturned a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was get his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) out and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he bowls his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to suit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that’s the true art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be good at it, if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have run out, and others hoping that the city will return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan returning in private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia helped drive al-Qaeda out of its bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they were starting an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That’s why I’m back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been lured by the increasing tranquillity in the capital since the U.S. increase in troops and the growth of local “groups of affected citizens” who, armed and in cooperation with the U.S. military, defend their neighborhoods.
But more talked about being forced home by visa problems and dwindling funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged Iraqis to stop giving visas to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni retiree said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarland press the same deficit as the rest of the country.
“Yesterday, for the 50th time, I explained to a non-Saharan that we are not French” – this slogan is self-explanatory to the smallest state of Germany on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which ranks fifth in the education monitor of the Institute of German Economy Cologne (IW).
As a result, universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high with 15.6 percent.
But the Saarland also brings the state children to the universities in an above-average number - many of them without a degree in high school.
"The vocational education system is used in the Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at IW.
More than one in five young people acquires their degree at a vocational school, which means that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are also considerably expanded.
Measured by the population, the equipment with dual degree programs is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms at the general education schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last daycare year is free of charge - a model that other federal states are now also copying.
Whether the performance of the students will improve sustainably will only be shown in future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of high-risk students shrunk from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as strongly as other federal states.
Bayern are expecting better.
And to the dismay of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - otherwise one could score in this area.
Because the language of the neighbors is mandatory at high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez has the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez has become a joke figure.
According to a new law, the clocks are set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The US-hostile Chavez justified his decision, among other things, by imposing the United States on the world the division into full-hour time zones.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the breakdown of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will have no relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my dignity alone," Chavez said, pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia was triggered by the decision to release hostages.
Uribe "spoke Venezuela in the face" with his decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain, Chávez is on everyone’s lips.
A new cell phone ringtone is causing a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed at the recent Iberoamerica summit by the constant interim calls of the left-wing populist, spoke to him.
Germans threaten 2007 salary downturn
Despite the strong economy, German workers are forecast to suffer a real wage loss this year.
Experts cited a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans Böckler Foundation, the employees could expect less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault is the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price increases in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper.
Employees may also face new burdens on unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed again to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and petroleum products drove the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the Earth's hellish twin
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: The European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and windswirls at the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided the proof - it tracked electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "primary soup theory", lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there should be hardly anything living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's devil's twin, but she's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has undergone such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the beginning of the 1990s no probe has been on its way to exploring this planet.
The latest research, now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underscores the uniqueness of Venus within the Solar System, the researchers said.
“They also show that the similarities between our neighboring planet and Earth are greater than initially thought,” the ESA said.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud swirl at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the Solar System has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
But it turns much slower around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, is hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained in the oceans on Earth, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has called on the great coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but protected Merkel from the accusation that she was conducting a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not renounced the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that, too," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from among the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, of the "showcase policy" of the Union in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there was fierce irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership has not only invited the German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to the SPIEGEL, also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
China's Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China rejects when European politicians in official capacity receive the Tibetan religious leader, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to secede Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
Every effort must be made so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not discharge into violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth riots in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must make sure that social explosives do not build up in us and discharge them into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "New Press" in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, the federal states and the municipalities were already working hard to alleviate problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this already shows first successes."
But it is too early for warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs like in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris, young people had fought heavy street battles with the police in the past nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burning in Toulouse.
However, greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as bad as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under 25 is "above average".
Above all, more training places must be provided.
Kolat emphasized: “We need to give young people a perspective.”
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "social control takes place in the families."
Many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned: “But we still have to be careful.”
We need to give young people the opportunity to participate quickly in work and training.
In the meantime, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed, and a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the day before, a convoy of around 1000 security forces has provided for rest.
The police will take action as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the riots spread over Toulouse.
The riots ignited in a traffic accident in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor, the police are not responsible for the death of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Cloud
The chancellor’s distant appearance documents that the coalition is at its end in terms of content – and that nothing can be expected of her.
In which country does the Chancellor actually live?
After her desperate appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was savage and poor in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be ruled by her.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she focuses too much on foreign policy with an extremely arrogant sentence.
That was provincial, she said, showing that she did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Bundestag, she has documented for everyone recognizable how much their accusations are true.
There was neither a concrete interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a distinguished politician who flees into foreign policy and even stays there in the rough.
Example of climate protection: She praises the decisions of Heiligendamm unwaveringly, but does not say how the climate goals should be achieved in this country.
Overall, the self-praise - so much insubordination the CDU-chef would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the phrase that the upswing is arriving at the people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of talking the world beautifully.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of low-earners?
She's got a few sentences left for it.
It is significant how often she promises herself when it comes to the child supplement.
Merkel needs three attempts to bring out a half-straight sentence.
It stumbles as if on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, face a tough battle – and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already discharged on the first topic.
He has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
He, for his part, counters with serious accusations: "I would say his own house was a haven for illegals," Giuliani replies, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of having privately employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates blow to attack: Because the Republican base continues to have no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-released 30-second videos that internet users have submitted via YouTube are hardly more than keyword generators.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
The Vietnam veteran also reads Romney’s Levites vigorously when he refuses to condemn waterboarding, an interrogation method that simulates drowning, as torture.
However, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that the important themes of the campaign now lie beyond the Iraq war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause flares up in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, grieving and apologizing in front of the base and television audience that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, gets stuck when he is asked what he thinks about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled civilian for the first time
A day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani leader Musharraf has been sworn in as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will soon lift the state of emergency and fulfil another Western demand.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him weighted lawyers after the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, had last week rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the krautrock are returning
Germany's Supergroup of the Seventies is playing again: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a recording from her big time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The intended sensation then takes place in the form of three set gentlemen at the dinner table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and especially their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the middle in a blooming white shirt at the age of 63.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, concentrates on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds up to a conventional piece of music.
That doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing music again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Targeted inquiries revealed that the name fluttered through collective pop memory, but not so sustainably, to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should the German not also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called krautrock was always considered more in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Lifetime Work to the survivors of the Cologne-based group Can in 2003, they were seen in questioning German pop faces in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudatio, the astonishment knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother later squatted on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and of transfiguration in the stranger is one thing.
Memory is overwhelmed with harmony because the trio only existed for two years and during that time also developed a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the then perhaps most radical German group.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Alte Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as communards who fled the city.
Less ideological than in the Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
Rather in a pointed artist's existence.
In the bulky garbage was supposedly also found a pennant of the singing club Harmonia Ottenstein and for the art a name.
There was some harmony in this.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because as calm and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The gathering of straw was not only for self-discovery.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record set of almost 50, as someone believes to remember.
From Rother came the desire to force harmony and to practice it occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band announced their separation in 1975.
Rother ended up in the Esoteric Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of cultivating the krautrock as its own German contribution to lively music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is here, the British, altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
With which the entire range of influences of the krautrock on the subsequent pop music would be outlined.
Harmonia fills the empty space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's phrase floats with the most peculiar sounds in the hall: "The only true music, it belongs to you the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with harmony in the farmer's room.
For the legend formation, projections of further black-and-white photos of wire-wired devices are used.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums, in order to elicit unheard-of sounds from the instruments via self-made effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in-depth engineers.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, under sound clouds it is hushed and wiped and sung in a beautiful place with emphasis "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music academies (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Those who call here "'68!" are not quite wrong, and harmony cannot be removed from it even now.
Even the most obvious things are thoroughly rethought on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of your nerves or give you moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderer's Peace", two films again deal with the Balkan War.
But both are not convincing.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and balls or they are too stirring.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
The good news first: although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is precisely there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had last lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nice-minor roles in feel-good movies for women and too many press conferences on the topic of Buddhism exaggerated one’s desire to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes a hunted man" (why do movie titles have to be as long and confusing as locomotive driver tariff agreements today?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has long passed his very best days, but who, even as a ruin-like monument to his demise, has preserved considerable remnants of the former charm.
But despite this triumph, "The Hunting Party" continues along with the German production "Murderer's Peace", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan War films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serb from Kosovar hedgehogs, after which one immediately falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not depicted here as the sole root of all evil, the flat-screen film is all too quickly lost in balls and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored almost exemplarily, why there has never actually been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "the fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at a different time with another director and a different screenwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard).
Both times small teams go to the forest to do something that the military cannot do and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the down-to-earth cynic as he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also tell him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the drain when the reporters succeed within the last five minutes in time-lapse procedure what NATO, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not succeeded in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to just revenge.
This is so bad that they want to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema logic.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (in this case, they are supposed to agree exceptionally) not to pursue the persecution too intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionately I see the swollen forehead veins, indicating: how tiring it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly those swelling heads, but they indicate how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan War film.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywood’s big flops.
You can add: there has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always it is true: when a star is floating around the world’s crisis herds or minefields, something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Beyond All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, it took decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably still mature - the now considered classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the screenwriters of the courage it takes to tell good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcastic artistic view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When questioned about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change.
Major cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps criticism for Olympic rejection
The mayor’s withdrawal from Hamburg’s application for the Summer Olympics has been heavily criticized by politicians and business.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
But von Beust urges realism in the assessment of opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the business location".
No other project in recent times has developed such great motivational powers in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, the sporting political momentum would not be maintained to the same extent.”
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "which starts from a changed timeline."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions are unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund expected for the beginning of December on an application of Munich for the Winter Games 2018.
“This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we envisaged until 2028.”
Yet the dream is not solved for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to lose a chance by burying the plans already at this point,” HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application also contradicts the statement of the Senate head on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the German Association of Higher Education Sports.
There, von Beust described Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 "not as a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only nominated Hamburg as the applicant city last week.
The SPD citizenship group accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Kleine Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the map Olympia and excluded housing construction," said the SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded an integrated planning for the Small Grasbrook and a later residential use, the CDU has one-sidedly relied on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had triggered a great enthusiasm at the time.
However, Hamburg failed to succeed Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Anyone who combines the terms Sweden and wooden box thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Isn't that right?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol’s factory directory.
Most of the ninety-four Stockholm-type Brillo boxes listed there are counterfeit.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968, internal investigations at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now come to a disappointing result: the six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén probably gave to the international art market, the Moderna Museet in 1995 is also a donation.
The prehistory is nested, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These were not (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartonage factory.
These were not works of art, but models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes that were rightly entered into art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes labelled "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem is that legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, and that Warhol had left them to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the Moderna Museet, investigated three privately owned Swedish Brillo boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their pressed chipboards were first primered and smeared, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the pressed chipboard with a paint roller without primer - besides, it is not oil-, but acrylic paint.
“These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol’s Brillo boxes,” Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve said, “If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material.”
Already in July, however, the Authentication Board announced to investigate the "serious allegations" that are being made in the matter of soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, they have remained in relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebels have abandoned soldiers, who had enclosed themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot be responsible for bloodshed, the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Government-loyal soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas use.
The two dozen soldiers had been hiding in the building for hours.
Approximately half of them went to court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 – among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle with around 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers who were supposed to guard him had apparently turned over to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops closed off the district around the prestigious hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the Scout Rangers elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics called for major demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
As early as 2003, Manila’s financial district was the main scene of the attempted mutiny of around 200 military members against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after nearly 24 hours due to the army’s refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
Keep the option open to increase the share of Versatel.
The move aims to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Previously, assumptions had already arisen on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house holds the shares only for a third party, it was said in the financial market.
On the day before, United Internet had already taken a 10 percent stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of which United Internet has bought for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a United Internet spokesman.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP to acquire its competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to settle for a good ten percent stake in Freenet and do not use their right to acquire another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their stake in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
Freenet poker, which has been around for months and is difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
So far, the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch has directly held 6.01% of the shares in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will contribute another four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
