Welsh people look like they're idiots.
There are a number of deputies who have proposed that their title should be changed to a member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was created because of plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
The police officers on the other side of the spectrum are incensed to make fun of them.
A member of the Labour Party was concerned that it would reimburse Twp and PwP.
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp domm means a pwp kaka.
A deputy of the Plaid Party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested an alternative.
A Welsh conservative said his group was split over the change of name, but indicated that MWP and Muppet would not lie far from one another.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced the same as the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The commission of the Assembly, which is currently developing laws to introduce the change of name, said: "The valid decision on the appointment of the deputies is, of course, up to the deputies themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public meeting on the proposal, which received much support.
The commission favored "members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMPs," but the MWP option received more support in a public meeting on the question of the title of the deputies.
The MPs seem to suggest other options, but the struggle to reach consensus may cause headaches for the presiding executive, Elin Jones, who is expected to unveil the bill on the amendment within two weeks.
The legislation on the reforms includes other amendments, for example, as the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of the deputies and the draft of the committee system.
Deputies are given the last word on the question of how they should be called when discussing the law.
Macedonians are voting for a referendum to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was drafted in a proposal to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province, which is called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly voted against its joining attempts for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the vote on the change of name, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that changing the name is the price to be paid in order to be able to join the EU and NATO.
The clatters of the St. Martin's Church are as calm as the churches during the Harlem Battle
"The old people said that there was a cafe and a church on every corner," said the Lord Adams.
"Today there is nothing more."
He said that the coffee shop was clean.
"They're socializing," he said.
"They're not going to be the ones that get people out of their way on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as those responsible imagine, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with homes and filled with people who do not help the remaining shelters in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings are white," he said, "and therefore want to quickly close these churches, as it is unlikely that most of these people will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black capital – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved into the 1930s.
A black community from not far away took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders on 125th Street, a main street for trading in Harlem, who refused to hire blacks.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but when the members of Father Johnson's community made plans for the reconstruction, they ordered the clapping game.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the clapping game "The clapping of the poor."
The expert who played the game in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world's first drumming game to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger drumming game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What took place in St. Martin in recent months was a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs, some were introduced by the lay leaders, others by the bishopric.
In July, the Sacristy – the governing body of the diocese, with its laity responsible – wrote to the diocese, with the concern that the diocese "would try to pass on the costs to the sacristy", although the sacristy was not in the hands of the architects and entrepreneurs.
A few pastors have argued about a lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai injured 13-year-old in lobster shower in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was drowning after lobster in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 o'clock in the morning, not far from Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been drowning with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help and you paddled over with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
He said that he had at first thought it was simply the joy of catching a lobster, but then "realized that he was being beaten!"
I'm going to get it!"
"It's all about his body," he said, as he approached his son.
"I told everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water,'" he added.
The boy was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in a critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Swim Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier, but this was considered a non-dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victims suffered traumatic injuries in the body.
The officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casabland to Swami <0xCC><0x81>s in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and for safety purposes.
Giles stressed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, most of which are considered not dangerous.
Sainsbury's climbs into the beauty market of Great Britain.
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, with beauty departments in a coffee shop style with specialized assistants.
As part of a significant increase in the UK beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods return, these larger beauty departments will be located in 11 stores across the country, and next year in more stores if they succeed.
The supermarkets invest in beauty because they want to fill up the shelves that were otherwise reserved for the dishes, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said they'd grow the size of its beauty offering up to 3,000 products with brands including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The assortments of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, which are already available, will also have more space with exclusive brand areas, similar to those in the boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique make-up range, so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly, which is increasingly being demanded by young consumers.
Perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, with the first opening last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Purchasing online in small amounts of everyday food in small businesses means that the supermarkets need to make more efforts to get people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, the manager of Sainsbury's, said that the outlets looked more and more like department store stores, as the supermarket chain is trying to compete with more services and non-food products against the discounters Aldi and Lidl.
ainsbury' has opened Argos olettes and hundreds of after-sales and has also bought several habitat stores since the supermarket both chain bought two years ago. This has boosted the sales of the food and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to overhaul the cosmetics and pharmaceutical department failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the cooperation was soon over after a dispute over the share of the revenue of drugstores and supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 drug stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy Chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Llodys should play a role in the plan, by introducing an enlarged range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, and four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty areas to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who may like to ask the customer for advice.
Our range of brands is tailored to every need. Through a friendly environment and advantageous locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that puts the old ways of shopping into the shade."
Peter Jones has signed a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Holly Willoughby.
Peter Jones, the star from Dragons Den, has become "silent" after television presenter Holly Willoughby signed a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This morning's host, 37-year-old, announced on her Instagram account that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby pushed Peter Jones, the star from Dragons Den, out of her lucrative Lifetsyle brand business in the last minute to focus on her new contracts Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "silent" as the TV star admitted during a spawning meeting in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she had no time left for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and doubled Willpughby's estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones fled the UK and entered one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “Truly, Holly’s main priority was far away.
It would have been their long-term future that would have accompanied them through the next century.
His decision to leave the country surprised all the people involved.
No one could believe what was going on at the beginning.
In the main quarter in Marlow, there is a warehouse with goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the abandonment of this morning's presenter, who is one of the bankable stars from Britain, could cost the company millions because they invested a lot in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and homewear, and now there are potentially further delays for the launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been standing with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby brought Truly to the legs with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, rose to office as president in March.
The couples traveled together and the vacation and Jones is 40 percent involved in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source with information about Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business affairs."
We've been struggling, and then we've been struggling.
He made the joke about the criticism he would receive from the media because of a comment that some people would consider to be "non-presidential," and because he is so positive about the North Korean president.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his playful "television presenter voice."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting, after the first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denuclearization do not come ahead.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leading politicians during the UN General Assembly a Saturday that the North sees no "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's former disarmament steps.
The U.S. would instead continue to use sanctions to further pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"I'm going to kill North Korea," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results - no more missile tests, help to free hostages, and the rapture of American soldiers who fell in battle from bullish surviving missile tests stopped, freed hostages taken
And he defended his unusual way of talking about relationships with Kim.
It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd only have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreigners were told they would not be needed.
Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been delocalized, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for the catalysis of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not calling for international aid, so it is a challenge," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet safe to work on foreign personnel on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Catastrophe Protection Administration, said that Indonesian functionaries would assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could participate in the relief measures.
In relation to the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately not sufficiently prepared for the will of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, there are none everywhere on the coast.
The apparent shortage of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even if there was a warning, may have cost a lot of lives.
Travelling between the various Indonesian islands is often a challenge.
Natural disasters make logic even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but needs at least three days to reach the site of the new accident.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the ruined Indonesian infrastructure the main theme of his election campaign and donated money to the streets and railways.
But Mr. Joko's reinstatement was also plotted by a lack of funding, where he sets up again next year.
Mr Joko is also exposed to the pressure of party tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority represent a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and a tens of thousands were driven out of their homes, as Christian and Muslim groups fought with knives, bows and arrows and other brutal weapons on the streets.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool compares the game to a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with a goal in the 89th minute a Samsden at Stamford Bridge in London against a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal and left his team 1-0 behind.
He took the ball with his leg foot and shot towards the goal.
The attempt has flown high over the box, towards the right corner of the net.
The ball has jumped over and Arrizabalaga jumped into the net.
"It was just about getting into this position, getting the ball and playing games like Shaq always as close as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the edge come and touched it once, and didn't just think about it and shot."
Chelsea were 1-0 after the break ahead by a goal in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker made a pass back to Mateo Kovacic in this game before sprinting towards Liverpool halfway.
Kovavic made a quick double pass in the midfield.
He then shot through a beautiful ball that sent the hazard into the box.
Hazard runs past the defense and ends up on the long poto with a left-footed shot around Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 a.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 a.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832.
Indonesia's death toll from the tsunami and earthquakes has risen to 832, as the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
According to the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings, which were destroyed by the earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5, and which triggered waves of up to 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with dust from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
An investigation for murder was launched after the body of a woman in Birkenhead, Merseyside, was found this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
People from the area who have seen or heard something should report to the police.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagen said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious in the area of John Street in Birkenhead should contact us.
I would also like to contact any other person, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded anything on dashcam footage, because they may have information that can be important to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body was found living in Birkenhead was found inside a house.
These afternoons, friends who think they know the woman arrive at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found.
The police are continuing to investigate and inform other family members of the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just wanted to go back to his home, but police told him that at the moment no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
People are now told that it may take some time to get back to their homes.
It was reported that a police officer told a man that the entire area is currently being considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
She repeatedly said, "It's terrifying."
At 2 p.m., two police officers were inside the lockdown and another outside the lockdown.
A group of police officers shook the door and guarded the building.
Anyone who has information should contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 Protocol 247 dated 30 September.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament is the new memorial to the series "Rewrite History."
His ban was a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England by the fanatic and puritan followers of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society describes Mr. Crick's suggestion as "unreasonable" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldmsith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the discussion about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the design of Oliver Cromwell was targeted in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The symbol of the English Civil War was not ordained by Cromwell and was not carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hama Thorneycroftsen's magnificent representation of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century's opinion and is part of the history of a figure that many still believe it will be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps first in the late 19th century as it is today, as a defender of Parliament against the external pressure, and in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it's an exact representation is still an issue.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of this division.
His role as Lord Protector is worth celebrating and remembering.
Swine is a farmer's
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, who was only identified by his family name "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery near a stall on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a swine surveyor in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, is preparing for an injection of vaccines for pigs in a hoffery.
According to reports, he had arrived Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered an open door to a nearby pigeonhouse.
He said that in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on the snout.
A court medical investigation has confirmed that daat 550 pounds of pigs killed the farmer, according to the report.
"Man's cousin's legs were bludgeoned and enraged," according to the cousin's family name "Wu," according to Guiyang Evening News.
The pictures of surveillance cameras show the yuan thunderstorm going to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body has been planted an hour later.
The animal that killed the man is not a pig of Yuan or his cousin.
A market guarantor told Evening News that the pig was jailed to prevent it from attacking other people while police were collecting evidence on the spot.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market's authorities are likely to negotiate compensation for his death.
Even if they were killed, they would be attacked by pigs.
In 2016, a swine attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, Massachusetts, and the man was severely injured.
In 2006, a 650-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer's tractor until his wife was able to remove the animal.
After a farmer was frozen by his pig in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They're just gamers.
They're just struggling, they just don't want to hurt you.
"You just have to be respectful," he said.
Rain in the Southwest of the United States due to Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the chilling waters of Mexico's north coast.
However, the pink floods will bring about flooding in the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
The Rosa has experienced winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane since 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugeni, in Mexico.
It is expected that the rose will move a sunset to the north.
Meanwhile, a canal is in the process of forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving towards the west coast of the United States, and the pink one month closer to the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture from the north and southwest of the U.S.
The rose will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity, which interacts with the nearest channel, will form widely distributed heavy locks in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inch rain causes hazardous flooding, mud flow and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes locks of 2 to 3 inches per hour in different places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 centimeters of rain are expected in parts in the southwest, especially many across Arizona.
Flooding is possible, with weather conditions becoming increasingly worse due to the destructive nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely easy to walk to the desert with the risk of tropical locks.
Thick rain can cause canyons that quickly turn into rivers and thunderstorms will bring locally rough air and dust.
The nearest channel will bring thick local rain to the parts of the southern California coast.
Closes of over half an inch are possible, which can lead to small sludge flows and smooth roads.
This will be the first race in the season.
A few distributed tropical rainstorms begin to get closer to Arizona, in late Sundays and early Mondays, before the rain continues to spread, in late Mondays and Tuesdays.
They will be placed in the four corners of the corners and in the middle of the corner.
In October, there can be some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
In this way, the temperature changes dramatically over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature fluctuations is a sunset in the center of the United States.
There is almost a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the sun will set to rise and rise.
In many central and eastern United States, a warm start is expected in October with widespread 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northwest.
New York City was able to reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast will provide high chances for average temperatures for the east of the United States through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
Over 20 million people watched a thunderstorm's gripping statement at the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continues, and broadcasters have interrupted the regular broadcasts for the last-minute twist of a Friday: an agreement that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake signed with the FBI to conduct investigations during a week of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh has fully touched her and tried to pull her out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a pathetic statement, said he was 100% sure that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, over 20.4 million people have watched the trial on Friday.
The company recorded an average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numerous other networks that have transmitted the process, including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In Nielsen, there are often some difficulties to include people looking at offices.
To illustrate the whole thing: The viewing number corresponds to that of a playoff football match or the Oscars competition.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators supported Kavanaugh's appointment, ran all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the process over the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
The interest remains high in the process.
Flake was the central character in the drama of Friday.
After the moderate republican office issued a statement stating that he would choose for Kavanaugh, he became a friar the morning of demonstration while trying to get a lift for a trial in the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with eyes down while he was being chased and was live on CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the land?"
He was told, "You have power, while so many women have no power."
Flake reported that his office had filed a statement and, before the elevator closed, that he would have to say more after the hearing of the committee.
The cable and broadcasting networks all later reported live hourly how the Judiciary Committee should vote to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said that he will only do so with the understanding that the FBI is investigating the charges against the nominee for next week, what the Democrats wanted minority.
Flake was partially convinced by the conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was evident that the Republicans would not have the choice to vote for Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" regarding Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of leaving the European Union for her plans to "weaken politics" with the UK's future and national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, alongside her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson underlined her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a suggestion that Britain and the EU should raise their taxes to each other would be "very ridiculous."
Wayde-Sims shooting: Police have arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with murder by shooting Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The officials released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and Simpson and police said the Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses on the spot and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS partner WAFB reported.
After Simpson was heard, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His deposit was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office has released a provisional report saying that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department honors the refugee officers of the Louisian State Police, the State Poice Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and residents of the area for the help in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flesh in search of justice."
The Sims were 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach said his team was "destructed" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
"It's always a matter of worrying," he said.
A volcano spills ash on Mexico City
The volcanoes of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached southern neighbourhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Catastrophe Protection warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it became active in the crater, and registered 183 gas and ash sessions in the last 24 hours.
The center of the house has a few rows of lightning.
Pictures on social networks show thin ash layers on the cars and neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noticed an increase in volcanic activity that shook 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital city since a 7.1-strong earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Political conflict with Catalan separtiates prior to the anniversary of the independence elections.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters disagreed with the police, and as thousands participated in the rival demonstrations for the first anniversary of the Catalan polarizing election for the separation.
A group of masked pro-separatists were detained in riots against the police with eggs and powder color, which formed dark clouds in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, the police took out their knobs to control the fighting.
A few hours ago, a pro-independence group called "No Forgiveness, No Forgiveness" against Unionists who called "Long Live Spain."
Fourteen people have been injured in the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separtiates.
Electors voted for independence, but the result was low against the separation by the boycotts of the election.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people have been injured last year after the Polce tried to stop the election in the electoral offices through the region of violent conflict.
Pro-independence groups camped outside on Friday night to prevent a demonstration on the support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but had to take a different path.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, says he has no hope anymore regarding the perspective of an independent Catalonia.
“Justice has given me a few moments of joy.
"I saw my parents crying for joy because they could go a lot, but now I'm stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties had a hard time staying alive this year. Most of the most well-known leaders were in exile or imprisonment and waned on their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protests on the phone as support for the police, said the conflict has been heated by politicians from the two sides.
"It's getting more and more," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in the Preventive Prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would compete in the European elections next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving a car to the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car ran into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there will be damage to the gates and the building itself.
It's also possible that somehow a car was shot at with an armored bus.
Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers through Menga's gold.
Dolly Menga's first gold earned the prize.
Livingston's promotion kicks out the Rangers for Steven Gerrard's only second victory in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's storm proved the difference as Gary Holt turned his side with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side will remain in the Premiership without any profits this season and will play against the Leaders Hearts on Sunday, which is eight points ahead of them.
Rangers Rapid Vienna won the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their run in the division to six games, with coach Holt still enjoying the victory since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is trying to get away with visits.
His team should have had the nose for long before hitting, because his directness caused the rangers' problems.
Scott Robinson's effort was pushed through, but then Alan Lithgow could only aim for his effort in front of Craig's necklace in front of the goal.
The hosts were pleased to let the rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause misfortune to the visitors.
And that's how the gold fell.
The Rangers got a free kick and Livingston got up, combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to play Menga, who once touched and hit the center of the box.
At the time, the rangers dominated the property but found the home defense inpenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mainly quiet.
The pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly parade.
Scott Pittman was denied the legs of Rangers Golkipp Allen McGregor and Lithgow shot wide by another toy from Livingston.
Crusaders repeatedly came into Livingston's chest and were repeatedly cleared, while two elephants were demanded - after the necklace challenged replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were knocked out.
"Wonderful" by Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations in this high way.
Her style of play and staff has hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but great credit has had to go to the hole for the way that he has refreshed the team since its arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immensely, a super organized defense led, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes through.
The Rangers had a lot of inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerrard at the time, they fell short of the standards.
The last pass failed - only as they opened the home page - and it's something like a wake-up for the rangers who settled in the midfield.
Erdogan will receive a special reception in Cologne.
There were laughter and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) when the chefs of Turkey and Germany saw trying to drink coffee in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversy visit to Germany – which was planned to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have talked about problems including human rights, press freedom in Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan was on his way to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have put in place security measures to block a strong crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosques, but many supporters have appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents - many of them Kurdish - have also heard their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both protesters reflect the divisions of a visitor who is greeted as a hero by various German Turks and as a monarch by others.

Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Blessed by Order
Six prisoners were wounded in a high-security prison for men, the prison officer said.
Disorder broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST a Sunday and it continues.
Specialist "tornado" officers were assigned to take care of the order, which involved eight prisoners in a plane.
The officers were stabbed in the spot for small wounds in the face.

Six staff members were treated for blessings.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that the police will be charged and could spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous perpetrators.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated at the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, offensive officers were called to jail to take care of a serious disorder in which the personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas can benefit)
It's rare to meet a tropical depression in Arizona, but that's what probably happened in the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa sinks last energy down through the southwestern desert pulling and bringing flood risks.
The national tribute has already flooded for Mondays and Tuesdays four-way to western Arizona towards southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct way over Phoenix to the Densden and get closer at least late with rain.
The National Memorial in Phoenix wrote in a Twitter post that only “ten tropical cyclones have been able to maintain the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest national hurricane center models predict 2 to 4 centimeters of rain, with isolated sums up to 6 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, are possible from 1 to 2 centimeters, with isolated sums up to 4 centimeters.
For those without flooding risks, Rosa's rain is a blessing because the region is affected by a drought.
Although the floods are a very serious concern, a bit of rain will probably be good because in the southwest there are dry conditions at the moment.
The United States after just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least an extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com said.
First, Hurricane Rosa takes its way to land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Pink, still with hurricane force a Sunday morning with maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm tends to kill more water in the Pacific and therefore loses strength.
So, it is expected to be landed in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday in the afternoon or evening.
In Mexico, the risk of flooding is high, and the risk of flooding is high.
"Precipitation of 3 to 6 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 centimeters possible," weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona in early morning hours Tuesday as a tropical depression, where it then moves up through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected by Pink or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the United States southwest desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will produce life-threatening floods and mudflows in the desert, and in the earth's depths and mountains.

Trump says that Kavanaugh is saddened by the rage of the Democratic Party.
"The election of Judge Kavanaugh as an election against the reckless and empathetic tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at an election party in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from the recklessness and embarrassment of the Democratic Party throughout the election process.
Kavanaugh vehemently and emotionally denounced before Congress the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he was supposed to have sexually assaulted them as they were still teenagers.
Ford has also sworn that this is the case.
The president said in a statement that "the American people have seen the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh to be confirmed as a vote for one of the best lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a confirmed number of deeds for the public.
The president never hinted at Kavanaugh's nomination during his speech on the importance of Republican electoral participation in half the election period.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
"I'm not running, I'm running," he said.
"That's why I went everywhere to fight for big candidates."
Trump argued that he was on a mission as to "become brave and slow down."
The first decisive election at the Senate level for Kavanaugh's nomination should already take place a Friday, a senior matworker told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, many have been swam away as huge waves hit the coast, as a major earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Samsden.
Hundreds of people participated in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday as 6 meters high waves hit the coast in the semi-darkness, which many rushed to death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"As the tsunami became threatening yesterday, people were still on the beach following their activities and did not immediately leave," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesian disaster protection at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it was full of cars, huts, Hzisers, it had torn away everything on land," Nugroho said, even more precisely, that the tsunami on the sea had hit the coast at speeds of 800 km/h before it hit.
Some people climbed on trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
Air shots made public by the disaster protection show many buildings and buildings that have been destroyed, bridges that have been ripped away and collapsed into a mosque that is completely surrounded by water.
Samsons were in the middle of the coastal town.
Earthquakes have been recorded in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology said in a statement that the energy that was sown in the event of an earthquake had the power of 200 times the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical situation of the city at the end of a long-drawn bay may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho has described the shooting as "extreme," saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies were found under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, plus 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho suggests that the injuries and damage could be large on the 300km long coast north of Palu, in an area called the Doggola and that I live near the epicenter.
The communication "as completely collapsed and we are without information" from Donggola, so the Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, stating that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's a bit of a tragedy," he said.
The agency is being harassed as Samsden is being harassed because of the fact that Palu was hit by a tsunami, officials said the waves came at the same time as the warning came out.
Amateur images on social media show a man on a higher stack who warns you by calling you on the road below before the tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a water wall hits the coast, sweeping buildings and cars.
Reuters was only directly capable of confirming the pictures.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power failure and the communication around Palu has been crippled, which authorities have been hard pressed to coordinate the rescue work.
The army first sent transport planes with aid supplies from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but those evacuated still need urgent food and items for the most important needs.
The local airport was just opened for rescue teams and will remain tracked until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 800.
It's as bad as bad.
While the staff of World Vision of Donggola arrived safely in Palu City as a place where the employees were accommodated in tents on the grounds of this office, there were scenes of destruction that the family had to experience, according to the Lord Doseba.
"I've been told that a lot of people have been killed," he said.
It's as bad as bad.
As soon as the aid teams began to recognize the extent of the destruction, some complained that foreign aid teams with great experience were only allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, material and personnel are only allowed in the country when the affected area is declared as a national disaster area.
But it's just happening.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'Okay, it's like a national disaster,' we can open up for international aid but the time has come."
As the second night in Palu comes after the earthquake and tsunami of his joy, friends and families hope that missing ones here are among those wonders that always appear after such disasters.
Samsden was rescued as a small boy from a canal.
A rescuer rescued a woman who was buried under a pile of rubble, right next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders who were shot down for the Asian players,
Others from the Roa Roa Hotel were seven students, so said the Lord Mandagi.
"As a paraglider in paragliding, I was carrying my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon said, in the hours following the news where the rumor of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel and the paragliding group went around, WhatsApp sent news to the team who participated in the Beach Festival.
Sadly, only one of the two shoelaces was covered, and only two of the shoelaces were covered.
"I mean, I'm just going to say that I'm the only one who's going to make the cut," he said.
Robbers stole $26,750 while filling a machine in Newport/Levee.
The robbers had a Friday morning complaint from a Brink's security officer who was about to fill a bancomat, stolen $26,750 in Newport/Levee, according to a Newport Police letter.
The driver was in the process of emptying the bancomat in a maintenance complex and was just about to fill the money, wrote police officer Dennis McCarthy.
While he was busy, another man came "runn from behind Brink's employee" and stole his money case that had just been handed over.
There are more suspects who have escaped from the scene, but the police have only been told how many would have been.
Anyone with information about the identity should contact Newport Police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He wrote on Twitter: "They are officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has since been called Ye and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The band will perform on Saturday night live, where the launch of their new album is expected.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande who for "emotional reasons" can only be in the show, said the show's founder.
Although there is an abbreviation to his professional name as, the West has previously said that the word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'you' as the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said the West me early in the year, at a presentation of his new album on Radio Big Boy.
"As I am, I am the sea, I am the sea.
It comes from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye - a mirror of our goodness, our evil, our darkness, everything.
The album as a mirror of who we are."
He was one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he chose Love and Brother Love.
A former Matt singer from the West, JAY-Z, has always played with small and large letters.
The U.S. government in Mexico has sworn to attack civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody encroachment on students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to engage the military against the civilians.
López Obrador has promised Samsden that "the military will never be used to suppress the Mexican people."
During a peaceful demonstration on the Plaza on October 2, 1968, the troops fired at the people and 300 moored at a time in which left-handed ruck passed through Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has announced support for young Mexicans through monthly grants to students and through the opening of more free universities.
He has said that the work of the schools and the schools are promoting criminal gangs.
The U.S. would have duplicated the funding of the K.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its sum in research in the field of artificial intelligence, says the investor and friends of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after hearing more and more from circles of the U.S. government than the U.S. does not have a proper strategy in researching AI.
Meanwhile, China has introduced its last year's plan: the first in the research of AI to be by 2030.
"Duplicating the research budget of artificial intelligence as a good start, considering that all other nations are so far behind me in the U.S., and we are working on the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The duplication of funding can double the chances that the next leap will be measured in the United States, Lee told CNN in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, as CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most well-known companies for AI in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, later serving as Director General at Microsoft Research and President of Google China.
Lee knew of previous technology competitions in the U.S. such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when you would be next to help you find next visionaries.
In the United States, people often have to work hard to get help from the government, according to Lee.
"It's just that China's top academy holds the top; it's the societies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have committed themselves to working at AI in the latter years of universities.
The U.S. government's immigration policy also improves the immigration system in the United States.
"I think the Green Card has to be automatically applied to professors in AI," he said.
The Chinese government launched its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations are making for US researchers, but the quality of academic work as in China is not as good, says the LEE.
Early this year in the U.S., the Defense Ministry founded a joint AI center, which should bring together partners from industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of an Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 trillion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, which currently invests over $100 million in AI.
The U.S. government has set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonia decided on a referendum to change the country's name
In a referendum on Sunday, the people of Macedonia changed their name to "Republic of North Macedonia," defusing a step towards their quarrel with Greece, which prevents the entry and membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the Noopesland is an attempt to identify itself as the province and has invoked its veto against its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated a proposal on the new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of the majority slave population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign showed that it would be difficult for the required 50 percent to reach the elections.
The referendum says: "You are for a NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
First of all, the name Change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the award would be to be assigned to include in organizations such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of Macedonia so that young people live freely under the pretext of the European Union because it means safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Despite the fact that it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said that they would have kept the result of the vote.
There is a second-third majority in Parliament.
The state elections will not be held until thirteen o'clock in the morning.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to the 2016 parliamentary elections, where 66 percent of voters held.
"I have chosen my children, our place as in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko were announced in the referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name for the way to NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, held a small stage in silence in front of the tents of those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get our heads high, not just through the backs," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we are proud.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring us major investments in Macedonia, while in terms of chomegaloscope it is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority are more than 80 percent of the population for NATO and the EU," Zaev said after leaving the polling booth.
He said that the "yes" result would be "the confirmation of our future."
According to a recent poll by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, 30 to 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum - less than required.
Another survey by the Macedonian television station Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent of the time, it's a staggering one.
For the referendum to be valid, 50 percent plus one must choose.
This would be the first round of the pro-Western government's pro-government campaign.

The jokes about the game against the rockies
With the selection of the nationals in the playoffs, as a reason there to force a new start.
But the always-to-challenge joke hopes to take the heels against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies are still in the playoffs that are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies climbed to a wild card with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday evening, but still struggled to secure their title in the first division.
"Even if we don't play for anything, at least we can do a great game, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I will experience this year.
Why shouldn't I do that?"

Trump's election in West Virginia
The president has highlighted the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's choice of the House of Commons while pointing to the importance of a Republican victory in these mid-term elections.
"Everything I've been looking for is going to come out in November.
Five weeks before the most important elections in our lives.
This as one of the big, big — I'm just running but I'm really running for that I'm struggling for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these horrible, terrible radical groups of Democrats, you see how it's happening now.
And those who are determined to take power under all circumstances, you see the sinlessness, the community.
"Those who do not care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain their power and control, who they want, the power and control, we will not be theirs."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resisting and blocking."
"And you see dat in the last four days," he said, referring to Democrats as "pink and senseless and flawed and lost."
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein with the name, which was most heavily exploited.
"Do you remember the answer here?"
Did you read the document?
Uh, uh, wat.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Work is no longer God's work.
It's kind of intolerant to those who think.
When I voted against my voters in the polls, I was a little overwhelmed.
Finally, I am the last one from a worker party that was told I would only be welcomed - just because we say wat we think.
My party colleague Joan Ryan has been treated similarly because she is resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, when the censorship criticized me because I wasn't right with Jeremy Corbyn.
Matt points out the importance of a responsible economy, national security, in Europe, ironically similar circumstances in which Jeremy has been criticized by leading leaders.
The Notes for Nottingham East Workers Meeting on Friday says that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of my eight-year-olds as local representatives were meeting on Friday night.
Sadly, I've seen a lot of people say that they've forgotten the promises of "good times" and "good times" as long as they've done so.
It is more and more striking that other opinions are not tolerated in the worker party and any opinion is judged to be acceptable to the party rather than to the party leadership.
This was as soon as Jeremy took over the leadership, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought we would have expected similar political views on once that I would have taken the time and place that I would never otherwise have assumed - in national security as well as within the EU.
Every time I publicly swore - and it's not really important I say - I then get a tirade of remarks on social media against the policies of the middle, and which we say I would only have my place in the Workers' Party.
And it's just my experience.
However, I know that I feel better than some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are exposed to sexist or racist concerns every day and do not look away.
One of the saddest aspects in these political times is when the level of abuse is becoming more and more normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the Workers' Party to adopt a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer of God and with any "non-confidence" movement or change of choice the party becomes more and more small.
I've gotten a lot of advice in the last two years, keeping me quiet, not being too harsh, and then I was "in line."
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I entered the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, preoccupied by a negligence of the Thatcher government during my classroom almost collapsed, I have tried to improve public services for those who need it most – be it as local politicians or as government ministers.
I've never hid my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have doubted my political position and the points at which I do not agree with the current leadership.
For those who support the movement on a peaceful basis, all I want to say is that if the country meets a Brexit that protects the household, trade and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour party.
But the only message I have concerns the Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve and I promise that no threats or political statements will stop me from acting on what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose Ayr undefeated
Two attempts in recent times have scraped up the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves the triumph in this spectacular Tennent's Premiership Match of the Day.
They are now in the final, the only one unmatched by 10.
In the end, it was a better defense, as well as the better grasp of opportunities, which allowed the home team and coach Peter Murchie to enjoy.
"We have been challenged in our games so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Good for Ayr, they took the chance better than me."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, endorsed by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, whom he got in a game by the Warriors, weakened Melrose and Jason Baggot was able to start an unchanged attempt.
Climo was able to convert a penalty kick for Ayr just before halftime, he then converted an attempt alone to score 17:5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's run, reversed by Baggot, was able to reduce difference to five points.
After an interruption due to an injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was faulted in a reboot, Ayr was able to re-start through a run of Stafford McDowall, defeated by Climo.
The captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose was able to use the advantage with a run by Bruce Colvine, after strong pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card as he tied the Climo without a ball on the strike line, Macpherson was able to score a touchdown in the back of attacking Ayr.
Climo was able to convert as he did from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe was able to start David Armstrong's kickoff and left flank player Gregor Henry to his fifth run.

The sea belongs to us: Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marine patrols under tackleage in the main quarter of La Paz.
Public buildings have lifted an ocean-blue flag.
From the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon, the sea is rightly ours.
It's our duty to take it back."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost in a conflict in the 19th century to Chile is still alive - the will to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
Now, the hope is greater than ever, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court on October 1, after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the dynamism, the spirit of cohesion and peace and, of course, hopes for a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians follow the decision of the International Court on large screens in the hope that the Hague will be decided in favor of Bolivia and – after decades of sporadic disputes – Chile will be forced to negotiate with Bolivia on a sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial fight for new elections next year – is relying heavily on the talks of a Monday.
"We're going to go back to the Pacific Ocean soon," he said in late August.
But some analysts are of the opinion that the court may not decide in favor of Bolivia – and that not much would change if it did.
The UN agency, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has no power over Chile and has stated that it is not interfering in any conversations.
The fact that the decision of the court was already taken six months after the final negotiations shows that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
As a result of the invasion of Bolivia, the last four years have come to an end.
"The issue of access to the sea has been torpedoed by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales's combative rhetoric has weakened all Chilean wills.
Bolivia and Chile continue to talk at some point, but it is then extremely difficult to advance conversations.
The two countries no longer exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, as Bolivian representative in The Hague, has pointed out that the decision of the court was made particularly swiftly.
On Monday, Bolivia offered "an extraordinary opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end a 139-year-old dispute with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also pointed out that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the maritime exit as a political expedition.
"Bolivia will never stop claiming its right to access the Pacific," he said.
"It's an opportunity to try to leave our past behind us."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen before it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm if it can't trust Washington.
He spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to keep its promises made by the presidents of the rivals at the summit in Singapore.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attempted to cancel nuclear negotiations of diplomacy more than three months after Singapore revived with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a dream" that further sanctions and the U.S. appeal against a declaration for the Korean War would ever crush Korea's knees.
Washington is cautious to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking first steps in the direction of a massive disarmament.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a general skepticism that Pyongyang seriously considers it with the disarmament of an arsenal that the country sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show shows a massive rise of head coverings on the streets.
If you want to expand your hat collection or block the sun completely, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a bunch of oversized headwear on the catwalk for their SS19 collection, which put the style on the Paris Fashion Weeks in the sky.
Absolutely impractical heat flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their striking creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's high point was an oversized beige hat with something resembling a feather flooding the model's head.
Other oversized accessories with delicious watermelon, a mixture of hat and pineapple – but they are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also released some strange masks – just right for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have folded lips and resemble more the Hannibal Lecter than the Haute Couture.
One creation resembles a diving costume complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looks like a melted glass cornet.
And if you want to see more, you won’t be disappointed.
It's important to note that the big ones are on their way to the beach.
The oversized heat strongly resembles the festival of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide board that has already been seen by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the heavily impractical heat that flooded social media is still sending a great creation on the catwalk – a beach pit as big as the model it represents.
The deep orange bast basket, with bast fringes and a white song grip, was the main focal point in Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection on the Paris Fashion Weeks.
Star stylist Luke Armitage said: "I expect to see great heat and beaches on our streets next summer - because designers have achieved such a huge impact, it's hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills are Indispensable for World Citizens
Scotland's independent schools hold the record for academic performance and this continued in 2018 with new outstanding exam results, which could only be strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other social endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), want to strive for the best level of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for further education in higher schools, for their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As a school with a discreet and discussed curriculum, we see modern languages as popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes into your head.
When you speak in your own language, it goes into your heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Since these exams, we can see that languages are at the very top, with the best results within the independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages graduated with an A+.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students have an A+ and Mandarin, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that students and young people need without a doubt in the future.
Languages as an elective subject are now considered the same as main subjects (sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, but also and so on differently.
A 2014 survey by the English Commission on Occupation and Skills found that employers indicated that it was difficult to fill free posts, 17 percent due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future tasks.
With more future job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are becoming more and more important in a global world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if one learns a second language, one has a real lead in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in England in 2013, 75 percent are not able to speak a foreign language well enough to make a conversation, while French as a single language with 15 percent is still in the two-digit area.
That is why it is so important to invest in the learning of languages in today's children.
Multilingualism, especially those of growing economies, offers children better opportunities to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, all schools offer other languages.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages that could be more important for England after 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there are always a lot of languages in the independent schools to choose from, with teachers specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are eager to provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve something, no matter what the future looks like.
In a global business environment, it cannot be ruled out that languages are vital to the future of the country and that must reflect on education.
In fact, modern languages must be regarded as "international communication skills."
In addition, the schools offer these choices, variety and exquisite performance for the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans who are waiting for LeBron James to start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Luke Walton of the Lakers announced that James will play a Sunday in the pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It only needs to be determined how many minutes he plays.
"They're more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As usual, James was asked at the beginning of this week what his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season program were.
"I don't need any pre-season games at this point of my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's whaling event tour in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin the evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, with a bunch of whaling campaigns.
It's Trump's first of five tours next week, with stations on him friendly-looking places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote in his hand for his election to the post of senior judge, Trump aims to cancel the standings for the upcoming mid-term elections, of which the Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the elections are held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia election today and how do you look at it online?
Trump's election event for West Virginia is scheduled for today evening, Samsden, September 29, 2018, 19 o'clock ET time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia Election online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump would mention this week's unveiling for High Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whose election has been on ice for a week due to allegations of sexual abuse with a former senator while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the first goal is to help Republicans win the face at the November elections and get new swing.
President Trump's campaign said the five events next week aim to "give volunteers and supporters new energy while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical to its agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible during the important time of the campaign," a spokesperson for Trump's campaign said.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the whaling event can bring the evening supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be treated by the media of Pittsburg," according to West Virginia Metro News.
This is the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senator candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, return to the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to help him get stirred up in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University political scientist.
Ryder Cup 2018 The United States team demonstrates courage to keep the fight for the hopes for the singles fight alive on Sunday
After three side-by-side sessions, the four-game game can be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swing swing pendulum is a very invented sport concept, but one that players believe in, and never more than in such competitions as these.
Where do you think it's going to be the swing?
"They had a lead of six points and now it's the fourth, so we now see this as a small draw," Spieth said as he finished for today.
Europe has the advantage; of course, four points ahead to play with another twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel a bit of wind in their sails and they have a lot to mount, not in the end the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together every day, and both go on with three out of four points.
The Spieth was deadly from the tea to the green and is an example.
The happy keel was harsher as his round progressed, sinking an important pit to tear down the match and where Thomas two of two is behind him.
His putt, through which they won the match at 15, was resigned with a similar whistle, of the kind that suggests that he believes the American team is not out there.
"It's just one of those things that needs to be done, and one of those things that needs to be done," said Spitfire.
That's all that's left of this game.
Eighteen holes to score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's old, but beloved couple are four out of four and can't do anything wrong anymore.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't shoot a bogey on Saturday, but they also avoided the Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and the nine back a Friday morning bogey.
On this run, and as their energy seems to flow at and from the spectators, it is cemented that they are the players it is necessary to beat on a Sunday, and there will be no more popular players to settle for a potential European victory when the sun sets over the Le Golf National, such as the Fleetwood and the Molinari.
At the same time, the two of them are at different levels.
It's a European victory, but it's already a victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of Monday's Fourball, when they were a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a laugh from which they could not get out so quickly.
No one is there to help you laugh.
The four balls and four-players are so fascinating because of the interactions between the pair formations; the reciprocity they give; the reciprocity they don't give in the way a strategy can change in an insight.
Europe has so far played better as a team and is going well in leadership for the last day, but this four-game meeting has also shown that the US team has the will to fight for what has been doubted, especially the Statesside.
Europe will go 10-6 to the Ryder Cup Final Day
Europe has a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the fourth ball of a Samsden and the fourth match against the United States with 10-6.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead the game with two victories over a swaying Tiger Woods for their four-point lead at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on the European side, who lost the trophy a couple of years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a poorly shaped American side in the four-ball, the series sitting at 3-1.
The U.S. offers more resistance in the fours, wins two matches, but they do not receive the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points out of 12 individual matches to hold a Sun for the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while joining the Molinari, "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend only the second pair have made the four points since the first four matches in the Ryders Cup history.
Against Woods and Patrick Reed won in four-ball, they well balanced against an empty Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau at a sympathetic 5&4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two matches at Samsden, sometimes showed brilliant breakouts in the four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, paused in these four balls in the morning, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the fourth and beats with 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the first and third listed in the world.
Europe doesn't just have it on a beautiful, lively day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-month winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the lead for the Americans with two points at Samsden.
They recaptured a tough 2&1 victory over Spanish players Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the Four Ball and later came back to win against Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the Fourth despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has a come back from a four-point deficit for the singles, although Furyk's side only needs to keep track of the trophy.
After they were second best for two days, however, a counterattack on Sunday looked like not wanted by them.
North Korea says 'in no case' would be one-sided disarmament without confidence
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations at Samsden that continued sanctions deepened confidence in the United States and there is no way that North Korea will unilaterally disarm its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual general meeting that North Korea has shown many "good wills" in the past year, such as the stopping of nuclear and missile tests, dismantling of the nuclear test site, and so not to further enlarge nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"No matter how, we don't see a similar response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust for our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While the Ri reiterates the well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to denuclearization in which North Korea is rewarded for the individual steps, it stresses its statement in which it does not expressly denounce a unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has always done in the past.
Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump wrote a joint letter on the first summit to an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim negotiated a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States solicited Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also called for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization-first' and increases the pressure through sanctions to enforce itself in a compulsive manner, and raises objection to 'declaration of the end of war,'" the Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions could put us on our knees is a dream of people who don't know us.
"But the problem is that the steady state of our lives is depriving us of our trust."
He did not say anything about plans for a second summit to test Kim and Trump, who was a U.S. leader ahead of those United Nations leaders the week before.
In a three-day meeting with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, he said: "If the party for denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a state of affairs."
Just so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from that of last year, when it was said before the UN General Assembly that targets on the US mainland of North Korean missiles were triggered by "Lord the Devil President" Trump as he called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year on the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take the first steps towards disarmament, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions to remain until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it's not important."
China and Russia are calling on the UN Security Council to reward Pyongyang for its efforts.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Tuesday, "The enforcement of sanctions by the Security Council must continue and in any case be enforced until we have achieved a complete, final and proven denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in the hope that they could end Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program by dropping funds.
Pompeo met the Ri behind the backdrop of the UN General Assembly and then said that next month he would go back to Pyongyan to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times in that year, but his last visit hasn't gone well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, stating that the process had been completed, but in less than hours, North Korea protested for its "gangster demands."
In a meeting with the Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the Americans were to take "decisive measures."
He said Kim would use "decisive measures" to seek security guarantees that Trump has secured in Singapore and rapprochement with normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students are required to attend the course.
A new course at Harvard University encourages all of its students to get more sleep and thus try to combat the growing macho culture, in which one spends the night with coffee in the flower.
One academic has found that students from the university, the number one in the world, often have no idea what it means to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham's women's hospital, compiled the court, which is for the time being the first in the field in the United States.
He was inspired to start the court after a four-way solution was given to the influence of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of the four solutions, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I going to be the first to do this, in my last year?'
He said that so far no one has told him anything about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The Court, which is first offered this year, explains to students the essentials about how good sleep habits can help academic and sporting performance, as well as how to bring a general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and manager of the university's health services, said that the university decided to offer the court after they noticed that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The course, which lasts an hour, offers a range of interactive tasks.
In part, a picture of a dorm room is shown, where students can click on coffee shops, rides, sports and books and then learn about the effect of caffeine and lube, as well as how sports performance is affected by sleep and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another part, those involved learn that long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university area, with interactive icons, then encourages students to reflect on their daily routine.
"We don't know if it's going to help the students.
But we believe that they have a right to know that - exactly how one has a right to know what health problems cigarette smoking brings," Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of learning to brag all night long still exists, according to the professor, and the modern technology and pressure on students, which is becoming increasingly large, has as a consequence lack of sleep and is a problem that is becoming increasingly large.
He said that the assurance of sufficient quality sleep should be a kind of "secret weapon" against stress, overexertion and fear - even to prevent that one adds, wanting lack of sleep shifts the mind into hunger and one has the feeling of being always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physics biology, helped Czeisler design the course, even after choosing one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the court had opened its eyes and inspired him to offer the court to the entire university.
He hopes, in the next step, to bring all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for when to go to bed, but also to get up, and to beware of harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights that can shuffle rhythms distributed throughout the day from the runway and thus cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Goal by Menga hits Gerrard's team
The Rangers had to endure a further defeat by Dolly Menga's goal, which defeated Steven Gerrard's tiny side to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's side have been trying to secure their first match since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team has brought Gerrard's second défaite in 18 games as coach and leaves behind eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Hearts, hanging.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before halftime and the line-up of the Rangers team failed to inspire and could not meet.
While the Rangers now slide to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, behind Hiberian by the difference in goals.
And there could be further problems coming to the rangers after Abiter Calum Spence was treated for a head wound, which was due to an object that was apparently shot at the end of the game.
Gerrard turned eight sides, giving him the opportunity to loosen Ayr behind and get to the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
The Holt, on the other hand, picked the same Livi 11, which cost the Hearts a point last week and would have been thrilled to see how his well-drilled team hit opponents here every time.
The Rangers had the ball more often, but Livingston had more with the ball they had taken.
They could have scored a goal for two minutes in the game as Menga took Scott Pittman's first pass to goal by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder had his big chance to go far.
A deep freeze from Keaghon Jacobs to Captain Craig Halkett gave Alan Lithglow in the defensive only the opportunity to shoot from far up the post.
The Rangers were able to win control, but it looked more hopeful than faith and their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos had certainly felt that past an eleventh of a mile would have been good after a quarter of an hour as before and Steven Lawless had run into each other, but Abiter Steven Thomsen ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers only scored twice in the first half of the goal, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's capshot and Ovie Ejaria's harmless shot.
While Livi's 34-minute start could be seen as a run against the game, no one can claim that they didn't deserve it for this effort alone.
Once again, the Rangers failed to agree with a standard situation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball between Scott Robinson, who kept a cold head and selected Menga for a simple goal shot.
Gerrard reacted during the break, struggling Coulibaly against Ryan Kent, which practically had a direct impact as the outsider overthrew Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came off the side to block.
But Livingston continued to provide the visitors with exactly the genre of game they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett taking one long ball after the other.
Holt's side could have continued to exploit this lead in the last moments, but McGregor kept the bass to Jacobs before shooting Lithgow from a corner.
The Rangers here alternated Glenn Middleton had a further right to a elephant as before with Jacobs disagreed, but Thomsen looked away again.
Almanac The inventor of the violinist
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on the exact day, and still continues ... is the spider physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
The violinist developed a method by which one can detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that later became known as the violinist's counter.
In 1950, the film "Bells of Colorado" came out with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who liked more cowboys than scientists:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "This is a violin counter that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you unplug the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evelyn: "It's going to be fine, it's going to be fine!"
The "Hans" violinist died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
His name, however, is still alive.
New cancer vaccine can help the immune system to detect biceps-like cells
New cancer vaccine can help the immune system to detect and kill bezier-like cells
Vaccination contributes to the immune system, as it can recognize malicious cells as part of treatment
In the method, immunity cells are taken from a patient and then converted into the lab
They can then recognize a protein that is in many cancer cells and then is injected back
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman who has been treated with the vaccine that contributes to the immune system to detect malicious cells, the cancer of the ovaries has disappeared after more than 18 months.
In the method, immunity cells are removed from a patient, then converted in the laboratory, so that they recognize a protein from many types of cancer, called HER2, and then re-spray the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of various types of cancer," which include breast, ovarian, lung and intestinal cancer, as explained by Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immunity cells from patients and "bringing them" as one attacked cancer cells has already worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West has started a pro-Trump tyre, with a MAGA cap, following his appearance at SNL.
It's not going well
Kanye West was featured in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show, after a far-reaching performance in which U.S. President Donald Trump praised and said he would run for president in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, which means Ghost Town, he wore a cape with the cape of Make America Great, protested against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Sometimes I talk to whites and they say, 'How can you love Trump, when he's a racist?'
"If I was going to be racist, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavaunagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not transmitted, the West's tirade has been uploaded through the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if it's going to be in the West.
The West also complained to the audience that he was having problems behind the scenes because of his cap.
"They harassed me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out like that."
They've been bullying me!
And then they said I was sunk," she said, as the Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken place?", followed by a statement that "he would wear his Superman costume, can no one tell me what I can do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
You're trying to lean."
His comments had brought at least twice bumps with the audience and the SNL cast looked like they were embarrassed, as Variety wrote, and one person told the publication, "At the whole studio it was totally quiet."
West replaced Ariana Grande, whose rapper Mac Miller had died two days earlier.
The West irritated others with the performance of the song I love it, like a Perrier's bottle was put on.
The West received support from the four-seater of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the couragest heads: THANK YOU TO THE MOB THE Beast."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West simply "is who's who and that's absolutely wonderful."
"I choose to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or his "art") with whom I think a harmful ideology that could spread to my community as it does.
He's free.
"We are," she said.
Earlier on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "the artist formerly known as Kanye West."
He's not the first to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and of course the later musician Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then called himself "the artist previously known as Prince."

The defendant was sentenced to the Belfast Magistrates’ Court.
The prosecution's findings are reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star kit harington attacks harmful masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's brutal fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31 years old, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen often give young men the feeling that they must mimic the strong man in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thinks "something went wrong" and wondered how to tackle the problem of harmful masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The kit, which recently married his Game of Thrones co-actress Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admits to being "pretty stubborn" on the subject.
"I feel personal, rather stubborn, at the moment - where did they go with the masculinity ship?" he said.
"What did we bring men when they grew up, according to the terms of the problem we see today?"
The kit believes that television is partly to blame for the rise of harmful masculinity, precisely due to its extremely masculine characters.
Then he asks, "What is it and what is it taught?"
What do you think about the fact that young men are taught on TV and that they are supposed to be the side of men?
I think that's one of the great things about our time - how do we do that?
There's definitely something wrong with young people."
In the interview, he also admits that he doesn't want to do any four- or down story of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that he has enough of "battlefields and horses."
From November onwards, the kit is worth seeing in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story of a film producer and his brother who is a thieve.
The actor said when he went to find his wife Rose's best thing that came from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in your series, so in that sense she became my future family, and my life from now on," she said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on behalf of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV or AIDS has reached an increase of 14%.
Health experts say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
The 40,000 new cases were all reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases were transmitted through sexual contacts, marking a difference.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through various parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV on the road has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health experts said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From one year to the next, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men, but end up marrying women.
Many of these diseases come from inadequate protection and relationships.
Since 2003, China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that maturity workers have leaked data from GOP senators, talking about "dangerous lions" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced the rumors that a member of her matuary had published personal information from three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia page.
The Democrat from Los Angeles insisted that the claims of "extremely right" figures and websites were celebrated.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," the Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the published information were apparently private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information has surfaced online, uploaded by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the add-on had a line to the Office of Waters, and they have issued information about a member of the Board of Waters, according to the legislatures to The Hill.
"These unfounded claims are completely false and an absolute lie," said the Waters.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, security and danger are the result of those unfair and false allegations - has by no means anything to do with the leakage of this information.
"This statement is completely false and completely false."
Waters' statements were quickly criticized online, including former White House press spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"It's a rage," the man wrote.
"It suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of taking something that they haven't taken, they shouldn't be angry.
You shouldn't defy one.
You don't want to accuse your friends and family members.
It has to be quiet and quiet."
Mr Fleischer has manifested himself to compare Waters' reaction to the criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who had been accused by critics of being provoked to anger during the unrest thunderstorm.
Omar Navarro, a Republican nominee who is defiantly opposed to the waters in the midterms, also published his opinion on Twitter.
"Great," he whispered.
In the statement, the Water said that the office "has informed the appropriate authorities and those responsible for the application of the right about these false claims."
"We want to make sure that you are responsible for the day," she continued, "and that they will be held responsible for actions here that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my office."
Johnny English Strikes Again – Rowan Atkinson Parody
It has become a tradition to now look into all new British films Brexit plays, which is not appropriate in the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise. This began in 2003 and was re-established in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a way to make this self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-deprecating, self-depre?
Regardless, the glossy and incompetent Johnny English with a plastic face has his credentials for a second time to mess everything up – the name of him already says enough, namely that it is a wide-ranging comedy creation intended for non-English-speaking cinemagoers in other territories.
Of course, he's a silly secret agent who, although has a strange appeal for idiot glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a stroke by Mr. Bean and a clapper of the guy who has a single note to the "Chariots of Fire" main member at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
He is also based on the traveler and international Man of the Mystery, who once played Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclaycart television commercials, leaving chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in the current Johnny English film.
I was enthusiastic about the scene where Johnny English came in a helicopter, dressed in a medieval armor, while the rotating helicopter blades clapped briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's donation to physical comedy can be seen, but the humor feels "underbotted" and comically overflowing, especially those "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now want to offer comedy as an ingredient with more persuasion.
The humor feels like it's meant for kids and not for adults, and for me, Johnny English's stupid adventures are simply not as original and focused as Atkinson's daf-stupid sketch in the person of Bean.
The current situation is that the United Kingdom is experiencing serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super-secret Internet network of spies in the UK that uncovers the identities of all agents in the assault – unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop that brings the barrel to overlay for the prime minister, a pompous and combative figure who has already experienced a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson might make her best with this so-called Theresa-May character, but there's not much to work with in the script.
Here they inform secrets, wanting each individual spy and danger is that they have to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means the murmuring Johnny English and person, now employed as the school director of a distinguished establishment, who but secretly gives courses like one becomes a spy: some lovely jokes here, the English wants to set up a kind of school of rock-based spy school.
The English has been expedited back to Whitehall for a briefing and urgency and back to meet with his old suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, with a submarine commander, a sober role in which Vicki Pepperdine is wasted a bit.
So Batman and Robin are all wrong but in the name of the Majesty's secret service again in action and make the acquaintance of Olga Kurylenko's wife Fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister is endangering a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he could solve Britain's computer problems: the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
The English and the Bough begin an odyssey of farce escape manoeuvres here: dressed as servants, they set up a French restaurant in Flamen; they create chaos at the expense of Volta's luxury yacht; in the English, some anarchy as before tries to create a virtual reality headset to familiarize themselves with the Volta's house.
All the sketches have certainly been taken out for the last sequence, but as friendly and burschiko everything is, it already has something of children's television in bulk.
It's quite a bitch.
And as with those other Johnny English movies, I couldn't stop thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that lives up to his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for Britain to implement a four-day week, which is paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan in which the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party apparently wants the leaders of companies to return the spares they gained through the revolution of artificial intelligence to the workers through an extra free day.
This means that employees would have a three-day weekend - but the same is paid.
Sources say that the idea would correspond with the parties' economic agenda and also with plans to separate the country and the worker's preferences.
Switching to a four-day workweek is supported by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to become the advantages of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A review of politics is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It's not worth overhauling, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that matches the party's approach to rebalancing the economy and preferences of the employee and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to put behind such an idea, the Greens had already spoken out in the 2017 election campaign for a four-day week.
At the moment, however, this position is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not a general party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Treasury Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labor Conference to celebrate his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said that he had decided to seize back the power of "failed dictators" and "profits" of supplying companies.
The Treasury Chancellor also plans that current shareholders and water companies will not be able to recover investments here if a Labour government could claim certain "deductions" on the basis of wrong practices.
He also confirmed plans that four companies would place emoluments in the four-state of enterprises and the so-called "inclusive ownership" fund would yield 10% of the profits of private sector companies to workers, who could then receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, "60 Minutes," whether Kavanaugh's investigation could change opinions here
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a last vote in his nomination to the Supreme Court at least one week, raising the question of whether the Bureau (FBI)'s findings could convince Republican senators to name their support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something new that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more likely to work than his work colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"As I entered the audience, I said that I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called out after this happened, this accusation came out, and really said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined, united."
But Graham's vote was cut and stoned.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is firm and there must be a particularly strong indictment to change them," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: the board vehemently disputed it," Graham said in the context of Christine Blasey Ford.
"Everyone they call can't be beaten.
It's 36 years here.
I don't see anything new that could change the situation."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
These Saturdays are worth taking place in New York once again at the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a tremendously impressive line-up of stars who have appeared, but has a just as impressive mission: to end poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is worth attracting thousands of people at Central Park's "Great Lawn," not only to see such muse acts as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to pay attention to people's real goal of the event, i.e. the end of extreme poverty in 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that fights against poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), people who are going to the concert must perform a number of tasks, or "actions," such as working as a volunteer, writing an e-mail to a leader in the world, calling someone or other tasks that help end the goal of poverty.
But how much success has Global Citizen, with only 12 years left to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, an honest way of requiring people to become active or again a further case of “clictivism” – people who think they would bring a real change by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 11 million "actions" of their supporters aligned to different goals.
They say that the actions helped them bring global leaders to advertise commitments and unlock policies of more than $37 billion, which will help more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and reports coming from these actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the collected money so far has had an impact on nearly 649 million people in the world.
One of the main commitments is, among other things, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and employers committed to "helping children realize their full potential," and promising - after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen - to give Rwandans $35 million to fight the country's
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can bring social injustice from malnutrition to a foothold in history," said the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the audience at the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that more than 5,000 actions have been addressed in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and that the government has announced financial support for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which is worth reaching more than 5 million women and children with nutritional support.
In response to a FAQ on the website, which asks "what makes you think you can end up in extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen responded: "It's worth a long and hard way – sometimes falling and failing me.
But, like all major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, if we are to succeed, we want to be stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are just a few of the artists who will perform in New York this year, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as presenters.
The U.S. could use a Navy blockade to restrict Russian energy exports
Washington said they would "when necessary" deploy the Navy here to stop Russian energy from coming to the markets, including in the Middle East, as U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has betrayed, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia’s involvement in Syria – where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government – is all just a four-way path to exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they want to be in the Middle East, just like they want in Eastern Europe and there in the southern part of Europe, to convey energy," he said.
And if anyone can believe him, there are always ways to do that.
"The American States of America have the opportunity, with our Navy, to make sure that sea routes are open, and, if necessary, to block them to make sure that energy is not coming on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance - an American NGO that sees itself as "the voice of energy consumers."
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran and noted that they are ultimately the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are, more or less, threatening to exert pressure and replacing fuel," he said, while still in context, viewing Russia as an economy that is totally dependent on fossil energy.
The allegations come while the Trump administration is on a mission to increase the exports of natural liquid gas to Europe to replacing Russia, which is a significantly cheaper option for European consumers.
To this effect, employees of the Trump administration, and Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which – if one listens to Trump – would turn Berlin into a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has often claimed that the 11-billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a few economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the vehement opposition to the Washington project is simply driven by economic reasons and that this would be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that it should be possible for consumers to choose these providers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has criticized Germany, which has once again reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the leading industrial federation, has urged the United States to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is well worth "seeking" whether she will run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "look good" if she goes to the races for the presidency after the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that means a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"November 6th, I'm going to see if I'm going to run for president."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying that going "would lead the country into a wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has so far been open with criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
He tweeted: "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we are elected."
It's been a long time since it was released, but Warren's own voters don't think he's going to be able to defeat it in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts truthfuls believe they shouldn't disagree.
Twenty-two percent found it to be a good idea.
The study showed that there is more support for the governor of vidrun, Deval Patrick, with eighty-three percent who are against it, and eighty-three percent who are against it.
Other Democrats of high profile mentioned in the context of the 2020 presidential election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide to unsubscribe by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump event
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence at night.
"What my son is going through, what has gone through since he is home again, I can sympathize with other families who are struggling with PTSD ramifications, and with the injuries our soldiers are coming back with," she told an audience at an event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest as "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other veterans "return a little differently, they are harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what the other soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the military, have done."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault against a woman, in a joint report of general domestic violence and possession of an alcoholic weapon, according to Dann Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., supports Defi for new asylum policy
Eighteen states in the District of Columbia are supporting a legal appeal for a new U.S. policy banning victims of gang violence or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives from 18 states in the district have entered a memoir "amicus curiae" (ami de la cour) in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge the policy, according to NBC News.
The entire name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union won against federal policies in August, has not been made public.
She said that her partners "and his violent buildings, which are gang members," had abused them, but U.S. officials had refused to apply for asylum here on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The states here describe lawyers who support the Grace as El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of requests for U.S. asylum come, as nations that have constant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals, which gave undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence the opportunity to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, District of Columbia's attorney-general, said in a statement that the new policy would "ignore state law, federal law and international law."
"Bundesstaatliche Recht requires that all asylum applications be granted the facts and circumstances of the request, and so a court goes against this principle," says the "ami de la cour."
Affected people continue to argue in the memorandum that policies would not allow immigrants to enter, which would harm the U.S. economy, they would likely become entrepreneurs, and a "important offer of workers."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in June that judges should grant asylum to victims who seek to escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is possible for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on their race, religion, nationality or if they want to be members of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said on June 11 in his presentation of politics.
Asylum was never thought to solve all the problems – even all the serious problems – with which people around the world have to deal every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of dead doubled compared to survivors
In the meantime, the situation was more and more pervasive.
"It feels like everything is moving," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tries to calm her little feathered baby at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance comes in.
There is almost no clean water there."
You were seen returning to ruined houses here by searching through neglected properties to save anything.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the earthquakes of 7.5 on the Richter scale, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a fractured back and shoulder, rushed outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to the ongoing neighbors.
When he was told of the feeling of being on the 5th floor in the hotel room, which shared with his wife and daughter to experience a brutal earthquake, he got tears and eyes.
"There was no time to save us.
I've been quenched in the ruins of the walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife yelling, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what's going on here or my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided ad that hailed the beneficiaries of mutual US-China trade in a U.S. daily newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump relates the last Wednesday to China’s paid-for advertisement in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after a China accused them of attempting to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, which China disputes.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is attempting to interfere in US elections is a new phase of Washington's escalation campaign to pressure China, according to a U.S. official.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertising for trade, Beijing and Washington are facing a de-escalating trade war, which has resulted in higher customs duties being charged on the other's imports.
China’s retaliation rates at the beginning of the trade war were thought to meet exporters’ states such as Iowa – which support Trump’s Republican Party – according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa – an important exporting state of agriculture to China – says Beijing wants American workers, farmers and businesses to do as they do.
China, as Branstad wrote in an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now ready to lend another ship, by now placing propaganda ads in our free press."
"Through the spread of propaganda, the government of China is going against the beloved and long tradition of freedom of expression in the free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand on the streets of Beijing, there is a few voices of opposition and there is no worthy reflection of various opinions that the Chinese could have against the economic development of their country if the media were to be controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also said that "one of the most well-known Chinese newspapers does not want to print his article," but went on to say that he did not know which one.
The Republicans are denying women's voters before the debacle in Kavanaugh, analysts warn
While many top Republicans behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh stand and go to defend against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned against an opposing action in the meadow, especially by women.
Emotions around the subject were extremely high and most Republicans said they would like to go ahead with the vote.
"Such things can't be rolled back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, who spoke to The Hill for an article published Sunday.
He said that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute pressure to have an FBI investigation was only worth angry voters.
"Women don't want to forget what happened yesterday - they don't want to forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a high-ranking adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, the freedom if one can believe a Washington D.C. newspaper.
The Free Democracy protesters, as they departed from the Senate, sang "November is coming!" while the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, chose to nominate Kavanaugh further, despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a statement by the Justice Committee.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are extremely important," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it was already high; that's true.
But it could go even higher, especially among so-called female swing voters, and the four-year-old and young voters, 18-29-year-olds, who – although they don’t like the president – often don’t choose.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which they filed an accurate description of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggest that it could resign if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"This is a confused confusion for the GOP," said Micheal Steele, former Republican four-seat National Committee, beginning last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee vote or the last vote or whether the Kavanaugh judge will be, it's also a question of how the Republicans handled the whole thing and how they treated them," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that Democrats are helping to be elected, a television broadcaster.
But Americans seem to be somehow divided over what they should believe about the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there is a tendency to believe the slanderer more.
A recent survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or possibly believe Ford's statement, while 35 percent say they definitely believe Kavanaugh.
And moreover, 38 percent say they believed that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lurking during his statement, while only 30 percent say the same about the Ford.
The FBI is now investigating the allegations of Ford and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian wrote.
Ford had been sworn in last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had abused her in a drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominees exhibited their genitals at a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has started a start-up that is said to be a rival of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where data is stored and who is allowed access to water information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that his intention behind the breakup was "the world dominance."
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to open their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can bring together contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like when Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all work together on one browser, and that's all the time.
What is unique about the "personal online data store" is that it completely depends on the user who can have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal emancipation through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, handle qualifications, and apply for such solid accessibility to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few matuworkers working as developers on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized app with the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not talk to Facebook or Google about whether or not they should introduce a complete change where all of these business models are put on their heads overnight.
"I'm not asking for permission here."
In a post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an eco-system, which is worth protecting the integrity and quality of the new web on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet as he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
At the same time, Berners-Lee was an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee is the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: First World War Pastor celebrated with "Victoria Cross"
The only clergyman from the Church of England who once received a Victoria cross as a fighter during World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Order on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was taken by a sniper for four days afterwards and never realised that he had been awarded the highest British military service.
One commemorative stone was unveiled a collection of his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "genially symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after the action of his Bop, which earned him the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann's battalion crossed the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick mist and under attack on the field and driven by machine guns."
He later ran to the line of fire and drove the battalion again, before taking a field weapon with his hand and raising three of the military unit.
Lt. Col. Vann was captured by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather "cannot be justified but it was a humble experience."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also dropped a wreath after the parade, on which the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band led.
Michael Vann says that he "feels very honored to be a part of the parade" and also said that "the courage of a true hero is proven by the support of many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this: you've been staying up all night to watch a packed Bellator 206, only to be denied the cake of the main event there.
13 battles were scheduled from San Jose, including six on the main map and they were shown live on Channel 5 all night in the United Kingdom.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to oppose each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were astonished at how the coverage of Peppa Pig was changed.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake for the fight until the early morning hours.
One fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's a government precept that at 6 o'clock in the morning that content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program," said David Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when he was asked about the transfer.
"Peppa the pig, jo."
Bellator Scott Coker's president of the company has said that they want to revise their schedules to accommodate viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we're likely to be able to do that," Coker said.
"But it's 6 o'clock morning Sunday there and we're not able to fix this until Sunday our time, on Mondays, their time," he said.
But I'm going to make it.
Believe me, when it was reversed, they sent a lot of news to here, and they were all not friendly.
We tried to fix this, we thought it was a technical disturbance.
But it wasn't, it was a legal problem.
I can assure you that it won't happen again.
We reduced the fight to 5 instead of 6 – as we always do – and we tried to deliver more to the fan, but we screwed it up.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has been "feeling low" in sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he was raised with a feeling of being inferior to anyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't realized until he came to the secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
In conversation with the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give other "hope."
He also said that he wanted to become a parent because he wanted to win the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the longtime show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to an illness.
In her appearance as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt that growing up "would be worth less" than anyone else, because "socially unacceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of being less worthy and different were the only things that gave us the power and perseverance to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something worthwhile," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally figure out his sexual preferences.
The two-time bronze winner at the Olympics is one of the most famous LGBT advocates and he used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke about it because he felt happy to be able to be open and live without consequences and want to make others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “surprised me”.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When someone so young, so much through" - he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 1 and his father died three years later from cancer - he said that it was difficult to find someone who was as old as him and who went through the same heights and depths.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd have to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what; there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had their tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him, 'You're not there to sit in the first row,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he stopped breathing that I finally admitted that he was not invisible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive at the Olympics in front of a crowd of people, there is no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – Proud of Heather Small – which he played in the background as he prepared for the Olympic Games and still caused him a cockroach.
Desert Island Discs is aired on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson at the Ryder Cup on the bench
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to regain his form to avoid giving it an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a 12th record at the event held every 2 years, was sent to the bench on Saturday by Captain Jim Furyk for four balls and four.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he did so often for the United States, the five-time main winner spent his day playing cheerleaders and working on the range at his game, hoping to improve what he is plotting.
Not even at the height of his career, he was the biggest driver, and therefore the 48-year-old player is not the ideal occupancy for the narrow tracks of Le Golf National, where the long rough-ruined failed shots are punished.
And if the ties aren't scary enough, Mickelson will meet British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, forming a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans with four points behind the 12 singles start, have a hard start, then Mickelson's match could prove to be absolutely important.
He trusted his husband, and he didn't say anything else.
"He fully and fully understood his role for today, folded my back, put his arm around me, and said he was ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a strong self-confidence.
He's on the team, and he's been on the team this week.
I didn't think he would play two games.
I've been thinking more about it, but that's how it worked and how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup match.
It could represent the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never really reached the peaks of its personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 lost players and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence has brought the team far more intangible benefits.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, moody, makes himself fun over others and he's a wonderful person who loves one in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun when they were traveling with him, and also this week, which was fun to watch.
He's more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a fairly large lead for the individuals of the last day in the Ryder Cup can turn very quickly into an uncomfortable step.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but it still won by just a touchdown with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but also barely," Bjorn said in a statement.
So the story will show me and everyone in that team that this isn't over yet.
Let's do everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
This isn't over until you see points on the board.
We have a goal in that is to try to win this trophy, and we need to keep on focusing on it.
I've been saying it all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Easing as his players beat themselves on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never put myself in the foreground.
Tomorrow we've got another one in front of us.
Tomorrow, it's the only ones that's going on, and that's a different pair of shoes.
It's great to be out with a partner when things are going well, but if you're alone out there, you'll be tested as a golfer up to blood.
That's the message you need to convey to the player: Get your best.
Now let your partner go back and he'll have to go his way and also his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, wants his players to beat each other better than they did as a partner, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points.
Furyk himself knows both sides of those big turns, because he was part of the winning team at Brookline, before they went off as losers, because Europe played out the "miracles of Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response to the question when Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, collected his players before last day.
"We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd love to keep up with the quick start you saw in Brookline, you saw in Medinah.
If the pendulum moves in one direction, then a lot of pressure is exerted on the middle players.
We've made a lot of progress, and we've made people feel like we're going to be able to do it."
Thomas was tasked with trying to challenge the challenge and faces Rory McIlroy in the lead, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European on the other half of the lineup.
"I chose this setup because I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about his individual choices.
The new warship of Germany was once again abandoned by the Germans
The newest frigate of the German Navy was commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the time of the Cold War, but it is, according to local media, due to malfunctioning systems and increasing costs not completed before at least next year.
The order for the "Rhineland-Palatinate," the main ship of the frigate class of Baden-Württemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper "Die Zeit", which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the distressing problems after delivery faced the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class, which the Navy had already ordered in 2007, are thought to be the replacement of the aging frigate of the Bremen-class.
They have a powerful gun, a variety of flight and ship launchers, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible that the newest frigate does not ulafen up to two years.
But the steady delays mean for the innovative warships – which are supposed to prove Germany’s striking power in overseas – that they have already become obsolete before they disagree with the service at all, notices “Die Zeit”.
The F125 frigate, pursued by the accident, made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media called a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that would have rendered the ship useless in a combat mission.
The software shortcomings were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class were operated by a crew of almost 120 sailors - just half the staff of the old frigate of the Bremen-class.
It also turned out that the ship had too much weight, which reduced its performance and reduced the ability of the Navy to make future improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the award sign of the entire project – including the training of the team – will also be a problem.
It is estimated that it has already reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – out of the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are mainly due to recent warnings that the German naval force is letting go.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy "issuing the assignable ships."
The officials said the problem got worse over time, as old ships were being laid but no new ships were being provided.
He argued that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flantermais
A new research aimed at exploring the Scottish Highlands in order to uncover how Flantermais uses the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the results will cast a new light on the behavior of the unique flight mammals and help to draft guidelines for future protective activities.
The study is conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland and is usually followed in Mecklenburg-Westphalia but also in brown Laangour and Daubenton-Flantermais at Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders are placed on important locations around the grounds to monitor the outdoor activities throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers also carry out mobile recordings with the help of hand detectors.
Well-founded expert analysis of all records determines the frequency of the flange circuitry and what kind of operation.
A map and a report of the habitat are then produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, consultant for nature conservation for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for the Flantermais and how they are being used by any kind.
This information helps to determine the advantages of living space management work, such as the creation of knowledge and how forests are best groomed for flank marshes and other similar species.
The population of the Flanders Mouse declined significantly in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom in the last century.
They are affected by buildings and development work that affect sleepplaces and a loss of living space.
Windshields and lightning can also represent a risk, just like mechanics and chemical treatments of building materials, but also attacks of domestic cats.
Flip flops aren't really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to the catches of predators.
They use a highly developed echo-localization technique to eliminate insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes Flanders very seriously.
They have trained ten experts who regularly perform recordings, sleepplace inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated flanking reserve at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which provides a habitat for eight of Scotland's ten flanking species.
David Thompson says that the grounds are the ideal landscape for them.
"We've had a wonderful time here," he said.
"We have the old buildings in front of the old trees and the wonderful living space.
But there is a lot we still don't know about Flantermais, so the work we're doing here and on other grounds will help us better understand what they need to be able to fall apart."
He emphasized the importance of looking for flantermais before maintenance is carried out on land, as an unwitting destruction of a single upbringing room can kill up to 400 female and young flantermais and thus possibly eliminate a very local population.
They are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, or disrupt them, or destroy their livelihoods.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish responsible for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about Flanders and for many of our species, we just don't know how it affects their populations."
Ronaldo accused of rape and accused of rape by his lawyers
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charge against him a "false report" by saying that people "want to make themselves known" by using their side's name.
His lawyers want to denounce the German news magazine "Der Spiegel," which published the false claims.
Juventus was charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
He is said to have paid $375,000 for not bringing the incident to the public, The Mirror reported on Friday.
When he was reported on the allegations hours after speaking in an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they're saying today, they're fake news," said the five-time winner of the balloon's ore and the camera.
"She wanted to make advertising for herself by using my name.
Well, that's normal.
They want to be known by calling my name, but that belongs to work.
"I'm a good guy," he added with a laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to denounce the "Spiegel" for the false accusations, which, according to Reuters, they call "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player wants to demand a decision for "moral damage with a sum that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which will be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident was reportedly committed in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room where he had allegedly been anal raped, according to documents from the files of the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident, saying he was "99 percent" a "good guy" off that "small percent."
The documents claimed that Ronaldo had confirmed that the two had had sex, but that a mutual agreement had taken place.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police, and that she had photos of her injuries that had been shot in the hospital, but had later agreed to resolve the case à l'amiable, as she was "greatly afraid of retaliatory measures" and was frightened, "publicly denouncing
The 34-year-old woman says she would now try to lift the enclosure because she is still traumatized by the apparent accident.
Ronaldo was just about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the apparent transfer and this summer he moved to the Italian Juve with a 100-million deal.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will be ready to lose it forever" car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will prepare it forever" if it loses its status as a world-leading car manufacturer, Economics Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK would have told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily suspend production at their factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston – where Toyota Auris and Avensis are produced – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK drops out of the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers from the United Kingdom have also raised concerns about the EU's abandonment without agreement on how cross-border trade should function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what, according to automakers, are supply chain risks in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is "finished synchronously," with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and from the EU for cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be an interruption at the border that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages in parts.
It would then be impossible for Toyota to keep a stock of more than a day at the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and as a result, production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid checks at the border."
"We want the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success right now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
"The statement not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must necessarily be able to advance what was an extremely successful phrase of the supply chain."
Toyota was not able to tell how long production would be stopped, but in the long run they warned that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost workplaces at the end.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is Unite's union boss at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I can say that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein will be postponed, according to the White House
Donald Trump's pledged meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "be postponed a further week after" as the fight for candidate Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Robert Mueller, who, in the event of a possible interference by the Russians at the elections, is investigating links between Trump supporters and Russia and a potential impairment of the judiciary by the president.
Whether or not Trump has kicked out the Deputy Attorney General's Office and put Mueller's independence at risk has been the number one issue in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the "New York Times" reported that Rosenstein was talking about being betrayed, to record conversations with Trump and to depose the president over the 25th additional article.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last night, he went to the White House and according to reports, he was about to turn in.
Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York City, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not "exit" Rosenstein, but you were misled to avoid a overlap with the unraveling of the Senate's judicial committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct, were both excluded.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying an entire Senate vote.
Trump's press spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she replied: "There hasn't been a date set yet, it might be this week, it might also be that I have to pass it a week later, with all the other things left at the Supreme Court.
But I'm still looking forward to it, and I always like to keep the press on the last stand."
Some reporters have questioned the claim: The Sanders did not hold a press briefing round of the White House since September 10.
Hosted by Chris Wallace.
Sanders felt that the lack of information was not due to an aversion to television reports that were aimed at "effect-hashing," even though she admitted: "I do not dispute the fact that they are conducting effect-hashing."
She suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be renewed.
"The president holds more R&D meetings than any president before him," she said, adding without evidence: "We have looked at the numbers."
Information rounds are still taking place, Sanders said, but "but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president directly questions, then it's definitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot and you've seen that we've done a lot in the past few weeks, and that's replacing a press briefing round in the future when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or attends press conferences with repeated attendance.
Press conferences are open to the public.
In New York this week, the president may have proven why by placing a labyrinthine and hereditary appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
Health minister calls on EU employees at NHS Scotland due to Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff of Scottish NHS (State Health Service) to express the country's gratitude and wish that they remain even after Brexit.
The Scottish parliamentary deputy Jeanne Freeman sent a letter about six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to take over the costs of applying for a regulated status for EU citizens working in its delegated public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "This summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU over the withdrawal are heading towards expected decisions for this autumn.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know it's going to be a disappointing time for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care, which benefits the patients and the community we serve.
"Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay."
Christion Abercrombie has no head injury.
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie had a distress operation after a head injury in the 31:27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury happened shortly before halftime.
"He came to the door and broke down," he said.
The trainers and medical staff asked Abercrombie for oxygen on the sideline and put him on a beer and brought him back for a further trial.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center surgery.
Harris added that there are "no details yet about the nature/measurement of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury happened.
This is Abercrombie, a college athlete in his 2nd year, his first season at Tennessee State after the transfer of Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his season to a total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax if they buy a land item in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp costs when buying a land item in the United Kingdom, using the additional tax under the Tory scheme to help the homeless.
The move neutralizes the success of Corbyn's action to attract young voters
The taxation of stamps will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Finance experts expect them to climb to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees if they buy a land item in the United Kingdom, while the additional tax under the Tory scheme will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May can now announce.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's action, attract young voters with promises, provide more viable housing, and aim for good deeds.
The stamp tax increase is imposed on persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, while the additional money reinforces the government's struggle to prevent sleep on the streets.
The additional tax – which in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second-placed and purchase-for-loan homes – could amount to up to three percent.
Financial experts expect the move to reach <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-United Kingdom citizens, which drives prices into the air and makes it difficult for first-timers to take foothold in residential buildings.
Many rich areas in the country – especially in the capital – have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new guideline comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax to help younger people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping land prices high by buying up land, but did not use it, and he urged Ms. May to give up quotas on viable homes in order to raise Britain's "women's income."
Mr Corbyn announced a striking set of housing reform proposals, including payroll checks and an end to forced evictions "without delays."
He also wants to give the community more powers to build new homes.
"Last year, I said I would use my term as Prime Minister to revive the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing the stained glass.
Great Britain is always open to people who live here, working and wanting to build a life.
It may not be true that it is for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and also for foreign companies, to buy housing like British mountain lovers.
For too many people, the dream of home is too far away and the drowning of sleeping on the road remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland CEO Jack Ross says his "great ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
Scott, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is just in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He entered the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership (1st League of Scotland) last season.
"I want to play for my country.
I got a B-cap and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching a lot of games from Scotland to Hampden as a kid with my dad and that's something that always pulled me back.
But that's only going to happen when I'm in the middle of the game."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid to follow such established names at such a large club, while previously dismissing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Successfully, the moment is measured for me on the following question: 'Can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and equipment at this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I would only consider myself successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of experience as manager, after a time as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months with coaching staff at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the downhill and third league and transformed St Mirren from the downhill candidate to the championship title winner the following season.
Ross says he feels better than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a good thing," he recalls, as he said.
"I really felt that the administration was right for me to play even more.
It sounds weird, but I've hit myself well, can live well from it and have enjoyed some grounded highlights.
But it can make sense.
There are a lot of things that need to be done every week.
I still do this as a stress and pressure through the work, but the administration just feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now that I do it, it feels like the best thing I've done all my life as an adult."

The perfect time for a pint is according to a study on Sunday at 5:30 p.m.
The heat wave of the summer has increased the revenues of British pubs struggling for survival, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar groups experienced an increase of 2.7 percent in July – but revenues and restaurants declined 4.8 percent, as the numbers prove.
Peter Martin of the consulting firm CGA, which compiled the numbers, said: "Continuing sunshine and the longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had more turnover than expected, with a further 2.8% increase in turnover, except for the fact that restaurants had a higher turnover.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restoration in June was further exacerbated in July.
The bars and pubs in which they drank were far more severely cut down than the restaurants had dropped.
The food and drinks were also eaten in the sun, although not as much as the restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to drink something.
In all pubs and bars managed, drinks sales rose by 6.6% in that month, with food dropping by 3%."
Paul Newman of RSM's leisure and hotel industry analyst said: "The results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and impacts of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It's not surprising that restaurant group continues to struggle, but a sales drop of 4.8 percent year-on-year is in addition to the ongoing cost pressure that is particularly high.
The long, extremely hot summer couldn't come at a worse time for operators in the food industry and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the so urgently anticipated oatmeal."

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One out of five children - some of them even 11 - has secret social media accounts, which they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has revealed an assault on "false Insta" pages
The news has driven the fear that sexual content would be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One of the five children – and part of it is just 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey among 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid assault on "false Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo release site Instagram.
The news prompted the fear that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they would run a marginal "main account" that they showed to parents while also having a private one.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who shouted, "violate me."
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which would have admitted to running private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online areas where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle is the "speaker of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics committee.
Eilidh Doyle was elected at the annual General Assembly of the Supervisory Board as the Supervisory Board member of the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated lightweight athlete and chairman Ian Beattie saw the move as a significant opportunity for those who initiate the sport to benefit from their broad-based international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the athletics community throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly if we took part in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be a language speaker for the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter run at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and owns a total of 4 Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC expert, can no longer go after having a transitory ischemic attack.

I couldn't go.
The doctors said, only in time it becomes clear whether and to what extent I am recovering.
It was hard work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and today I am doing mobility exercises!

Advertising for milk pumps that compare mothers to cows reaches the gems online
A company for milk pumps has reached the gems online with an advertisement that compares stubborn mothers with cows that are being squeezed.
For the introduction of the so-called "first worldwide unobtrusive portable milk pump," the Enterprise for Consumer Technology Elvie has published a not-for-profit music-video-inspired advertisement to promote the freedom that mothers – the milk pump – have to offer with the new pump.
Four real mothers dance in a hee-filled cowstal to a music that contains the following text songs: "Yes, I brush myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice it, these are no earrings that are my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pomp off, pomp off, I feed my babies, pomp off, pomp off, I caress my ladies."
The ad that was posted on the company's Facebook page, however, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has triggered mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it is experiencing the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It's a bad decision to use this product.
Just like we had to get pregnant and give birth to milk, with the exception that their toddlers were removed a few days after birth," one wrote.
Ellie's wife, Ellie's mother, has a discreet
Another commented: "Understanding traumatic both for the mother and for the baby.
But why don't they use a milk pump to apply to mothers who care for their babies?"
Another said, "It's a bad idea."
Others defended the advertisement, admitting to a mother that she found the song "immense stranger."
"I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought one if I were still going.
As I walked through the room, I felt like a cold.
It's a little crazy, but I understand it exactly as it is.
"It's a great product," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement that relates to mothers who pump off (dark at their work or the toilets) and feel like 'cow'.
"This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women showed that they were all dancing with the discreet pumpkins placed in their socks.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pompom is very unobtrusive, has no twists or strokes and fits discreetly into a steel dress, offering women the freedom to move around, keep their babies and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at "Mother," commented: "Elvie's pumpkin is a revolutionary product that deserves a bright and provocative introduction.
By drawing a parallel between pumping mothers and milk, we wanted to highlight the pumping of milk and the associated challenges and at the same time demonstrate in an entertaining and gripping way.
This isn't the first time Ellie's headline has been published.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-time mom ran over the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant refugees silently deployed to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrants has reached a high level, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the sharp rhetoric of the Trump administration and the guidelines introduced by them have sworn to bring children under sponsorship.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid to stay their own way in the country to put on the game by signing up to adopt a child.
The risk rose in June, when federal agencies announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the dates would be shared with the immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of children from people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the previously arrested were not pre-punished.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
"We're going to have to keep up with them," said Mr. Albence.
When trying to get the children to work out faster, officials, according to accommodation employees, introduced new rules, with some of them having to appear in court within a month after the arrest, instead of after 60 days (the previous standard).
A lot of people are using video conferencing instead to present their case to an immigration court for legal status.
Those who do not qualify for help will be expelled quickly.
As children remain in custody for longer periods of time, it is more likely that they will become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to accommodation employees and reports released from the system in recent months.
Lawyers have indicated that these concerns will be reinforced in a larger facility than Tornillo, where it is more likely that the signs due to the facility size will be overlooked that a child is struggling with them.
They added that the denial of children to the tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could worsen the trauma they are struggling with.
Syria demands that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their "occupation" immediately
Before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war has already subdued the country for eight years.
Al-Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally stopping on Syrian soil with the pretext of countering terrorism and are "detained accordingly with them."
"They have to resign immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Al-Moualem insisted that the "war on terror in Syria is as good as it is" where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have lost their homes.
He said that Damascus "continues its holy fight until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" both of terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presences."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of the war-torn land.
Regarding the refugees, al-Moualem said the conditions were in order for them to return and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have committed ourselves to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're trying to figure out what's really a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no building aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for a buffer zone in the last major rebel high-level Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal has prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Al-Moualem, however, insisted that the deal had "clear deadlines" and he expressed hope that the military action would involve jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, who were "expulsed."
UN ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members will soon come together to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and set the way for elections.
Al-Moualem put conditions for the participation of the Syrian government on the committee, saying that the work of the council should be restricted to "examine the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump won a second term of office
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the New Elections in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, a suspension of office or a scandal would prematurely end his presidency.
It's "the most dramatic end of a presidential election that ever happened!"
But so far, there is no sign of contention among the spectators.
Since 2014, quotas on CNN's major broadcasts have doubled to more than 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC to more than 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million mainstream viewers, four years ago it was another 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" hit the cable rate with no less than 3.5 million viewers at mainstream nights.
"This is a celebration that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, serial director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an early comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has a different theory.
He remembered a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
He told him that he was going to go to the Lord Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
In the chaos, there is chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the actions of the White House could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigration families will come back together and determine the health of the global economy.
Ignoring this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it transcends the understanding of an informed citizen, when one sees himself spending six hours watching a panel discussion of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep-growing background," which illustrates the source for his book "Fear," Trump's $15,000-dear-to-be.
For example, I'll never see Super Mario with the same eyes as before.
"Part of what he's doing makes it feel like if it's a reality show that he's telling you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director general of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars" about Trump's show with rotating casting and day-to-day unexpected conspiracies.

The walls of the house, and the walls of the house, and the
It's not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is seeing a cash flow, thanks to the re-alignment of the congressional districts, which have given two office holders the same seat in a race.
This recently relocated suburban district of Pittsburg is to the detriment of Democrat representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in a solar whale last spring in another district.
The lamb runs against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which surpasses the new 17th.
The maps were drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th has triggered a swap for campaign funding between the main funding body, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania after a scarce victory in a crowd of observers in March.
The seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight lead.
The U.S. has condemned El Salvador for supporting China, but has declined.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, without major resistance from the United States.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until the partners outsourced the administration team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to call back U.S. leaders from their diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "recent decision Taiwan no longer recognizes," Heather Nauer, the ministry's spokeswoman said in a statement at the beginning of the month.
However, only sanctions were reviewed against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which cut financial aid payments and defer visa restrictions, were painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rate.
With the advancement of internal meetings, the executives of North and Central America held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, to join a similar meeting last year, which was taken as a step towards moving forward in efforts to target migrants.
But in mid-September, leading functionaries made it clear that they wanted the conference to be preceded and thus effectively ended all considerations for penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence must now arrange the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a signal for the import that the administration is setting for the meetings, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned very quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no newly announced news or penalties from Washington.
A representative spokesman for the White House for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were discussed by the three American Housesmen, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who worked closely with the administration and who also talked about the conditions of anonymity.
Teaching History
Your next job message could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible legal disability, about which there is now evidence in the public dossiers.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, would like to find out with his inquiry on Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia to attack our elections.
If the Congress is to be re-assembled, then Mr Trump will have to show responsibility before the new composition, shortly before he has to show himself to the voters again, and possibly even to a jury of his colleagues.
These are many conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable - or that of his European equivalents.
We all have to make decisions on the two sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the length of this dispute.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not take the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that resulted from it.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and in democracy its merciless march is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are currently facing some of these turning points.
What do we do when Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's inquiry?
Rosenstein is in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year that he secretly admitted the president and speculated that he is not for his post.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the Times report is flawed.
"What will be our reaction if the newly demanded F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is sworn in to the Supreme Court, even if there are credible accusations of sexual assault and unfair statements against him?
And, above all, will we choose for a congress in the midterms to hold the Lord Trump responsible?
If we don't go through these challenges, we're going to go through democracy.
But I don't think we will fail because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who belonged to the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home and was deported to Auschwitz.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me off to begin Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika on it.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna fight
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna a Thursday is aware that the victory against the Austrians, having played impressively equally against Villarreal this month in Spain, brings them into a strong position to qualify for the Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first match of the season since the 2-2 match with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a jumpbrid to achieve better things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we would get something and they went home with a point.
I think we might have seen it in the end, but on the whole, it's probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were the better side in the second half.
It's a big European night again.
Hopefully we can get three points but this will be a tough match because they had a good result in their last match but, with the spectators on our side, I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result.
The last year was definitely hard, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but it feels good now.
The squad is good and the boys all have a lot of fun; the training is good.
Hopefully, we will be able to move forward and be successful in the last season."

Even though participants of the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talk to members of their family about it.
Half of the individuals in this nationwide study said they were talking to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a member of their family, but they're not taking the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
That's how one starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't make your wishes known early enough.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as those choices play an important role in calculating the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help to find an opportunity to pay the cost.
Your choices to pay for your long-term care include a traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid cash life insurance to help cover the costs, or a self-insurance with your own wealth – as long as you have the money.

A man was shot with a gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot a few times with an air gun while he was on his way home after he left.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, undercarriage, and in the hand.
The shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. BST, was described as a "coincidence act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
They don't want to be killed, and the police are looking forward to it.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died during a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian state of Palu on Friday, with the expectation that the number of dead will increase.
As the communication capabilities collapsed, officials were unable to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, an area in the north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a force of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was about to celebrate its 40th birthday when the earthquakes and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over more than 300km (180 miles) from the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit frequently by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to information from the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggalamei killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the middle of the Sismic Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of the past year:
2004: A major wave on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong waves hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 star hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-strong earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
About 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-strong earthquake hit one of the Menawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial surge hit the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and triggered destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly surge and tsunami.
There was no tsunami at the time, but more than 100 people were killed by falling buildings.
2018: Greater waves hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake has destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily settled thousands of tourists on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaksa and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was convicted of domestic violence, reporting a report of domestic violence and resisting a detention, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the suspected crime, he removed the phone.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured debt of $500, reports KTUU.
He was a Saturday before the court, where he declared that he was "certainly not guilty," as a result of a confession of guilt, the broadcaster said.
Palin faces three class-A pardons, which means he could go to jail for a year and get a fine of $250,000.
He was also convicted of a Class B offense, punishable with a roof in prison and a fine of $2000.
This isn't the first time that Palin has been indicted.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the suspected attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, reporting a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon while being drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had been hit in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for seeing his son's violent behavior and connection with PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-strong earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are out and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck a little away from the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on the social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as the tsunami struck the shores.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a paid home depot truck to carry out the attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, and had pedestrians and cyclists who were in his way overrun in Oct.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors had to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and caused "intentionally" serious physical damage, according to the declaration of intent to demand the death penalty, filed by the Southern District of New York.
The two charges can lead to a possible death penalty, according to a court record.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury accused Saipov of 22 charges, which included eight murders in aid of protection money blackmail, which is usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and an indictment for violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "essential plans and precautions," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "cruel, fearful and decaying."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, pain, and loss to relatives and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan DIego Mendoza and Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug-suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiring for two years of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were killed on 19 June 1953 on electric chairs.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has shown a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court records.
He told the investigator that he was feeling good because of what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the agencies that he was inspired to carry out the attack after an ISIS watched videos on his cell phone, according to the accusation.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in his hospital cell, police said.
He was not guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal duty defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"People think that the decision to envision the death penalty, instead of a confession of guilt and a life in prison without an opportunity to be released, will prolong the trauma of these events for everyone," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked not to envisage the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore today during a protest at a Tory conference that he would "mobilize the people's army."
The former Ukip leader said the politicians had to "play the heat" of the Euroskeptics - while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be "out" if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Madam May faced to bring back the deeply separated ranks has been souligned by pro-remain Torien, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has been struggling to keep track of their Chequers compromise plan around attacks by Brexiteers, remainders and the EU.
Allies insisted that they should continue to fight for a deal with Brussels, despite the setbacks – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose either their package or “chaos.”
The Lord said the Leave Means Leave Rally in Solihull that he was sending out the Chequers."
He suggested that the Lord should give Farage a peer and be given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he was going to leave, we'd be out now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I stand up for Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers."
To make his opposition to the EU clear, he said, "We have not fought in world wars to be subjected.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
The Lord Bone has suggested that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to stay is completely wrong."
The story Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, and told the journalists: I just said: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not choose, it is not popular with our party and our activists who really get through the streets and lead us to be elected anyway.

The presidential candidate is looking forward to becoming a presidential candidate.
U.S. President Elizabeth Warren said she was "seriously looking forward to becoming a presidential candidate" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrat de Samsden spoke about her future during a speech at the stadium in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, ran in November to be re-elected against GOP State Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It was the center of speculation that opposed Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters in the stadium format since Trump took up his post.
One of the candidates asked for a presidential nomination.
Warren replied that it was "time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that also means that a woman must be at the top."
There was a blast in the back of the LSU Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced a Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in relation to the deadly shooting against the basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting, and asked for help to identify the man who is in the video.
The Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early on.
"The Wayde Sims suffered a shot in the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, according to 247sports.
Wayde grabbed to help his colleague and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, with a gun, and admitted that he had shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained without a four-commander detention in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a 6.6ft junior who grew up at Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season with 10 starts and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton knows the world championship title more after the team's succession gives him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It has become clear that the Mercedes team success will play a major role in the race as Valtteri Bottas qualified the Samschden ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost took Hamilton apart while defending his position in the first two tier and inviting Vettel to attack his opponents.
Vettel was the first to go into the pits and led Hamilton into the traffic at the end of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went a tour afterwards into the pitches and was behind the vet as he came out, but Hamilton was first after a wheel-to-wheel action, as the Ferrari driver unintentionally had to release the band and risked still delaying to defend the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and was the seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He was then the first for a majority of the course while keeping his tyres to a quick finish and taking over Kimi Raikkonen to become fourth.
He was finally on the 44th tour and drove the pits but he was not able to increase his rhythm in the last eight tier yet, while the Raikkonen got the fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team did such an exceptional job to have one two, Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made a joke at a rally with Senator Dianne Feinstein because he insisted that he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are "bad and dishonest and dishonest."
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when one sees the roar, when one sees people who are angry and evil and dishonest," he said.
"When someone looks at what is being made public and leaked and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember you?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember his answer... you've leaked the document - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't leak.
Oh, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't.
Feinstein received the letter detailing allegations against Ford's Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked at the beginning of September - but Feinstein contested that the leak was known from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he asked."
But his denial did not arrive well at the president, who commented during the rally a Saturday, "I tell you, that was very bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president, who continues to nominate his defense of the Supreme Court, which has been charged by three women for sexual misconduct, suggests that Democrats are going to use the claims for their own purposes.
"They want to get back the power with all the means necessary.
"It's a shame, it's a shame, it doesn't matter who they are, it doesn't matter who they are, it doesn't matter how they have to run to gain power and control," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars bounced for losing in the Elite League the Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the back match 5-3 in Dundee a Saturday.
The Giants were early on with two goals by strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made the home team the balance before the Giants were back on track due to the Dwyer.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goalkeepers secured the victory.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast a Friday evening.
It was a fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, and the Giants won the three matches before.
Dwyer's opening was in the fourth minute at 3:35 by a Kendall McFaull Assist, with David Rutherford giving the assist while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a charged initial period, Sullivan brought home the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt made Cownie's balance at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants would give with a lead and the first break as he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard brought them back to the same level with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second half and he has ensured that they win with his team's fifth in the half of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, are home to Milton Keynes in their next match.
The airplanes are dying to make sure that hundreds of people in the plane can flee before an earthquake.
A flight attendant in Indonesia is recognized as a hero after he died while trying to make sure that a plane with hundreds of people in it gets safely off the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Strong neighbors continue to plot the area and many have been trapped in the rooms of the city of Palu.
But although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly shaky control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He remained to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, could safely flee.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower as he thought he was going to collapse.
After that, he died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision probably saved hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News reported.
Seas have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before reaching Palu's helicopter.
"Our hearts break when we hear it," he said.
While the agencies feared that the number of deaths could go up to thousands, while the country's disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is expected that the number will continue to rise, as many bodies are still under the room while others cannot be reached," said the agency's spokesman, Sutop Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that were up to 6 meters high destroyed Palu, where a sun is held a mass funeral.
Military and civilian service providers provide assistance and support.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mom told Sky News: "Every minute brings an ambulance body.
The water is scarce.
The mini-mares are plunged everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is making a quick move to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
It's a tragedy, and it could be even worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I beg you all to work rooftop and night to complete your duties within the scope of the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit this year by an earthquake in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crashed: Air Niugini now says one man has disappeared after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now saying that one man has disappeared after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was in the process of lowering.
Air Niugini said in a public statement that they could not stand up for a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they are working with local agency, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline has not responded directly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane got up on the water as it was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The police said that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers will still be in hospital, and that all are in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact demise of the faith remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane landed in the lagoon, not far from the slope.
Some of the witnesses said that the plane had gone out over the slope.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very deeply touched.
"It's an extremely good thing," Jayne said.
Jaynes said that he and others had made it through the water that went to the stalls, to the safety exits of the plane that was going down.
He said the stewardess had panicked and yelled and that he had suffered a small wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy said that seamen working close to improvements to a shipyard also helped in the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicated that over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents from PNG-registered airlines, but none of them were in relation to Air Niugini.
Analyst retraces the time span of the night in which a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded Saturday's explanation of her case in a second inquiry into a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. analyst Paul Rowlett of the Department of Justice has briefly stated as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He retracted for the jury as a cell phone donation was used to co-host the move of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night he died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from many cell phone operators who showed that Tellis was on the night of his death with Chambers, which contradicts his statement of unfairness, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sandford.
Sandford put out a samsung, claiming that the roof was not in the city.
When investigators asked if Tellis was going to tell the truth when he said he was on Sandford's truck that night, Sandford said he was going "because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he knew the Chambers had been around for about two weeks as it died.
It's been a while since they've known each other for just a few weeks.
Rowlett said that after a while after Chambers' death, Tellis had texted, called and contacted Chambers from his cell phone.
"He's gone out of his life," he said.
It is planned that the defense begins to give its final arguments.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to take place before the jury.
The High Breed What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive message.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claim that the hip hop has gone from its origins of political messages to the solution of social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently regained popularity in the UK due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
After a black?!
New York City's baby girl gets fired for a "racial" phone call
A New York babysitter sues a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misadressed text message from the mother, complaining that it was "after a black man."
The couple denies that they are racist, and compare the complaint to "extortion"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed horror when she found out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when it arrived for its first day of work in 2016.
"After a hard time," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to his husband, he sent it to Mrs. Maurice, two times.
After noticing the fake pass, an "untrue" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, explaining that the child girl had just gone, had done a poor job, an African-American, and that instead of expecting a Filipino, the New York Post said.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her one day's work and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple to receive compensation from the dismissal, and expects a compensation of about $350 per day for the job of 6 months for which it would have lived in the house for which it was initially hired, but without contract.
"I want to show them, look, something's not going to happen," he said, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rebutted allegations that they were racist, saying that it was the reasonable decision to terminate Maurice's position, fearing that they could not trust him after they insulted him.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist people," said the man, Joel Plasco, the post.
Is there a way to get your child into the hands of someone with whom you've been struggling, even if it's a bad idea?
"Your newborn baby?
Dajee."
Plasco said, while comparing the complaint to "extortion," that his wife had only had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
Is there a way to get rid of that person?
"It's not a good option," said the investment banker.
While the court case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, smashing them for their behavior and their logic.
The Paddington publishers feared that the readers could not have been related to a beer that speaks, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put oneself in the position of someone who celebrates reading it first before it is published.
"It's very exciting to know what we know about Paddington's success."
It said that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a small teddy bear to write the children's book, would have been rose if his work had not been accepted, and added that the 60th birthday of the books would be "battersouth" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who describes it as a "very important family member," it says that his father was quietly proud of his later success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he wasn't a person who broke up," he said.
"Because Paddington was so real to him, it was a bit like having a friend accomplished something: it's one really proud of them even if it's not one of his own work.
I think he's seen a little bit of Paddington's success in that direction.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was on the way to death and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, his daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors unsuccessfully tried to save his life.
"Nad has often called to say that it looks very bad, that it's not expected to be packed," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I was asked by Nad to say that it would die in the next two minutes and that I would have to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'm on the side.
I'm going to make sense.
The drugs that the doctors gave him to keep his heart on the beat have slowly and slowly disintegrated and left his system.
It was just a short time ago and that was the end.
I just sat there and waited, knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn't go out and cry or cry because I was in a situation with relatives and people.
“I’m going to have to rattle the steaks.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is momentarily saddened by the loss of her daughter, has to climb into the plane with the other passengers – without knowing what to do with them.
"No one knew anything," she said.
"I lowered my head, and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the fly I saved a huge amount of sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved.
Women in grief send cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who loved them because of suicide lost their lives in order to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent maps with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support, along with a Welsh bridge.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel," he said.
Madame Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an inflammatory grin.
"Everyone knew about their greed.
"They're always trying to keep their mouths open no matter what."
But, he left his job before he died because he was "in a dark place."
In 2014, it was Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, who found his brother-in-law after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that this will have consequences."
Mrs. Davis made the cards, "to notify people that there are people out there who can go to one and talk to one, even if there is a friend.
Just sit on the floor – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been befriended by Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after her mother's death.
He didn't say that he was feeling bad or depressed or something like that," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we realized that something was going on.
It was the end of Christmas - when the children opened their gifts and did not look into their eyes or anything like that."
It said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to agree with it: "It raps a laugh through the whole family.
We're breaking up.
We all have to fight and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on an unstable balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could really get something like what one asked - a time-limited survey, with limited scope - we might be able to achieve a little unity," said Mr Flake a Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "fall out of place" in a stake.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters investigate the FBI?
The rest of your time is completely up to date.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans get poor results, then they will be heavily weakened in their attempts for the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush took the phone and called on the senators to lobby them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI produces its report?
There will be an election in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 elections in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to overcome a gamble and summon him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's "successful" overthrow of Kim
The number of survivors from North Korea and South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug quoted data from the United Nations Ministry in the south and said there were 1,127 survivors last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China play a major role in increasing the cost of human smuggling.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The majority of survivors from the north will eventually be offered a South Korean statehood.
Seoul says that since the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees the survivors as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
The relations between North and South Korea – which technically continue to wage war against each other – have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to conduct talks on the halted denuclearization negotiations.
This is after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agree to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho has given the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S.A., there will be no self-confidence in our national security and under these circumstances it will be impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally for the first time," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called the nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying that in his temper, he would not be suitable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the comments the Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like that, they would have said they were "hysterical,"" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh claimed he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as they were both emotionally contested.
During his introductory statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, partly yelling or getting dressed while talking to his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputation killing campaign" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed that Kavanaugh's statements proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it shows that he voted against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements in his way of rushing against the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi expressed concerns as it was asked whether it would try to indict Kavanaugh if he was sworn in, and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only fit to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in court where it's right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she would be concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is considered conservative justice.
In his unheeding, Kavanaugh asked questions about the possibility that he might be overturned by certain Supreme Court decisions, leaving the way.
"It's not the time to take a hysterical, partisan person to court and then expect us to say 'this isn't wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
The woman has to do it.
It's a fair hate speech, months and years of anger that overflows, and hasn't gotten out without crying.
"We'll cry when we get angry," Mrs. Stone said 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a leader somewhere where she said she was also going to cry when she gets pink, but that she was developing a technique, which means that when she gets pink and starts crying because I'm crying, she then says to the person with whom she's talking, 'You might think,'
I'm going to be angry."
And then it just went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partly allowed as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of a former job, in a mainly male office, where I cried narrowly with indescriptible anger, was that an elderly woman took me on a collision—a cold manager before whom I was always a little scared—and pulled me into a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know it's rose.
"You're sad and you're glad you got it."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the course, Mrs. Schroeder, with great frustration, thought that it should no longer be thought about the idea of becoming a presidential candidate for herself.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the course, and the last thing they needed was another one.
One called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since it was already in the campaign, it was behind the donation collection, so it swore that it would not enter the course unless it was collecting $2 million.
It was a battle that was lost.
He found out that some of his supporters, who gave men $1,000, gave him only $250.
"How much do I have to pay?" he asked.
When it delivered its speech and announced that there was no formal campaign to start, it was so overwhelmed with feelings - gratitude for the people who had gone to support, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and count for voters and not delegates, and anger against sexism - that it swallowed him up - that
"I think I've had a heart attack," Mrs. Schroeder said in response to her comments.
"Someone thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what I was going to write on my grave.
"Did you cry?"
The U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing.
The first waves of the trade war between the United States and China have made a difference, and even if the fight is not over for a long time, a break between the countries could be long-term advantageous to Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warnings at the beginning of this year by taxing an important Chinese exporter, such as solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new tariffs hitting objects worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), so that in the end, half of the goods coming from China to the US were taxed.
Beijing has repeatedly struck back, placing recent tariffs on U.S. goods at a value of $60 billion at five to ten percent.
China has sworn that it will join the U.S.'s shot-for-shot, and the world's second-largest economy will not close in as quickly.
If they wanted to get Washington to stop, they would have to go on demands, but publicly doing little in front of the United States would be too much embarrassment for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, the experts say that if Beijing makes the right decisions, the US pressure on China in the trade war could be positive in the long run, as it makes the ties between the two economies less likely.
"The fact that a quick political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, could create the conditions that could trigger an economic turbulence in the two countries is in the end far more dangerous than the spectators have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, a research associate for the think tank of New American focused on Asia.
Syria is 'prepared' for refugees who are returning, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the refugees who want to return and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions have now been met for those refugees who want to return to the country and for those who have to flee because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their living situation to be able to return.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are still six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they did not accept any needed help or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup when they defeated Team USA with a result of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive runs on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown when the Danish captain's team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had major tournament problems, shot his tea shot into the water at par-3 of 16th laugh, thus losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been excellent in all his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players who have each had a 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament took the hot form.
American Jordan Spieth was ranked 5&4 by the worst player on the European team's rankings, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best-placed player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has fallen 2 in 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has become the European with the most wins of all time at 25.5 as a career point.
"I don't normally cry, I can't make a difference.
It was a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for taking me with him and believing in me.
I'm so happy to be able to get the ball back.
"I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He will be the torch to his national team, John Ram, who defeated U.S. legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles game a Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel in defeating Tiger Woods, I watched him as I grew up," said the 23-year-old.
Woods lost all four of his matches to France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles as second after Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has had problems finding fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who have played the entire tournament over golf at a high level.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
There was a time when we were going to see Europe.
We've been fighting.
The chapel for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll be back together again, I'll talk to the PGA of America in our Ryder Cup committee and we'll continue.
I love the 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your courage.
We've been overwhelmed."
