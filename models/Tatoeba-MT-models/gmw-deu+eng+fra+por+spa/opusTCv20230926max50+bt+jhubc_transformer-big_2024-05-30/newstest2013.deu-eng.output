A Republican Strategy to Oppose Obama’s Reelection
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, affirming that election fraud in the U.S. is less common than the number of people killed by lightning.
Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for conducting the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of U.S. governments have passed new laws since 2009 that complicate the procedure for registration or voting.
This phenomenon gained importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a court file is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana’s law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states forcing voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such a badge.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions affect young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are regarded as voters who vote more for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who vote more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic votes.
It is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators in eight states promoted laws abolishing voter registration on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns to register voters in the 2004 general elections helped to register about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the number of new voters registered by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they make up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same goes for the Hispanic population.
The latter made up only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who represented 76% of the voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the passed laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the decisive states for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the Electoral Board to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes shows erroneous results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already undecided men for performing early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
Studies conducted in the U.S. included numerous interfering factors between control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that with a follow-up after 12 years, the likelihood of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years, respectively, if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options where prostate cancers can remain untreated if they do not affect the quality of life in the long run, and in these cases they are more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and offered treatment as the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should and who should not be treated are determined with increasing accuracy.
Therefore, I still recommend performing the test.
But most importantly, talk to your doctor to determine if it should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that allows to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone were to eat well and exercise adequately.
“If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It severely harms people's health.
“Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, rectum, rectum, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against rectal cancer,” he adds.
Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In excess, it increases the risk of developing Grimm or mast colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found reducing the risk of prostate cancer, another showed more likely an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family pre-stress.
"Conducting an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
Analyzing the Higgs boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson last summer has aroused some stir, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or "least wrong" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented at a major physics congress in Kyoto this week, but data is still lacking to be completely sure about.
Nevertheless, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, since there seems to be little risk of being deceived, and let’s take a look at what it’s all about.
There is an inevitably inevitable law in this world that makes it impossible for two objects to be present at the same place at the same time.
It’s not possible to violate this rule – and don’t try too hard as you’ll be hurting yourself.
For even if particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that it is also governed by one such law: the Paulian principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state", and that "state" consists largely of some of their properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and kindly obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons, an evil gang of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred – certainly not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which by the way is absolutely amazing): the mesons that we will not treat here and the "force particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
However, it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, if a particle accelerates with an electrical charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this location, somewhat like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" in order for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be quarried by a very large rock.
This is why a huge particle accelerator such as CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator by itself.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon by the way) have no mass.
What can all this research be "good for," asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they are used to verify the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to closely study any deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stuff some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major shortcomings, as it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (ups again!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Effects
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is none.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous-bar laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was initially seen as more of a "laboratory play."
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With its committee on "Dignity Death", Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had left him a two-year deadline.
"They gave me five years to live, I've made seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at the home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he resigns to getting help with eating.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring his medications to him, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest wish is that you cure my diarrhea because it is humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing while standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois' home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the person's ability to take a step backwards," he notes.
Because, according to several people working in palliative care, large events take place in the midst of these regressions.
Patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed with so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who take care of them.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die “consciously and by suffocation.”
But through the disease, I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
“I don’t have any desires in life anymore,” she says before accepting that you put on a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, she expects a last visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers offers personal care and assistance with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more enjoyable.
In Quebec, a bed for palliative care is available for 11,700 people.
This is very little, considering that we will all die someday.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with brandy or Pepsi, as desired.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," says Nursing Director Nathalie Savard.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, there is no day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family gathering in the yard and is well supported by his pillows as one pushes in his honor, a 36-year-old man surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children tragically dies after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients aged less than 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel said in a statement.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stages of their lives, either at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Home Palliative Care Society in the Greater Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this major inadequacy in Quebec’s healthcare that causes several palliative care specialists to face the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting to move to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without taking any measures to relieve her.
I fear that patients will only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients with bitterness until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
The chances of Hélène Richard’s survival were already minimal when she discontinued a laborious chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I gave up the fight, she told me.
However, she told me that I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not giving in to this desire after their pain has been alleviated by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Montreal Society of Home Palliative Care, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which amounts to either sporadically or permanently putting the patient to sleep until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated all say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to put me to sleep,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals of great magnitude in Quebec
Every day, road construction officials, major construction companies, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's odd how the system has been disintegrating since drastic measures were taken," Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police, jokes.
The scandal was revealed by him due to an in-depth investigation of the embezzlement in connection with the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he stresses, "the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in the contracts," because some restrained their instincts to maintain their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
Established in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit and its troops are also making great efforts with the government’s auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the policemen of the "Marteau Force", which since 2009 has caused the "Canalization Cartel" of Montreal to act more restrained in the artificial inflation of the contracts...
Over the past few weeks, she has been conducting rows of house searches and accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, explicitly accused were engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter caused a stir by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the award of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito had his hand everywhere in the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the then-in-power liberals.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraising for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts, the costs of which were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games from the construction company, as well as bribes in the amount of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the costs of which he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they could be smeared by artificially inflating the bills with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadowy budget that filled his cash registers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, plunging Montreal into a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first deputies in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed the sale in 2010 of a community property that was purchased for $5 million and resold to 1.6 million developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
Of the investigation, which will ultimately be conducted, she says that it “draws on a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of the system undermined by ants to stop the evil and denounce the culprits.”
She said the procedure was “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but we need a Montreal-only investigative unit and supervision to prevent the return of the questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of the "mandate holders who are aware of the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Taking a 70% share of black money in funding election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was just a slight rebuttal of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which he says would not change the situation: "As long as campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for public procurement and financing the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on your side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements inspire me every day to improve my level of play.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
From my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed gradually.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s newcomers are accustomed to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This leads to a player like me having to face up and want to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Yes, of course.
Ancelotti instills respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken us the place of leader.
But we are lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the round of 16 in this way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our words to say against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group ahead of Porto so that we can host the return match of the 16th as a home game.
Can the PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
To become a big European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the means to make this project take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the Ligue 1 title as it was last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really important to us to take this title.
Last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be a champion with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are struggling for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept this.
However, if we win 4-0 in a home game against Troyes, and you still find something to blame us, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what more people are expecting.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to create a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League we have shown strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the round of 16 for two seasons, and who has also made huge expenses!
In terms of the sums invested, you were believed to be 15 points ahead of the game break!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winners and tell us that we finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the achievements of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better that one speaks of a "Zlatan addiction".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores many goals.
That's why he came and he proves that he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was at my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from taking out some playing time.
I have seen things there from which I have emerged stronger.
Today I am able to achieve good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the Bleus.
We have learned our lessons from what has happened in Ukraine and today we need to be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championships.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Bleus to Brazil.
Is the tie that was forced on 16 October in Spain (1:1) a kick-off game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone has stood up for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a match like this in my career.
Bitcoin makes it possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as so often happens in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system shaped by banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange like BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After reaching a high of $30 ($23) in June 2011, Bitcoin fell to $2 five months later, before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) showed interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competitive with the dollar or euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes exchange back) through games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trading is always controlled and handled by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously custodians of the accounts, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded are present in the account book of public accounts spread throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding that additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole gets "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money for cheating, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the problem will receive 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but divisible up to a hundred millionth, which leaves a certain leeway...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol,” assures Pierre Noizat, who just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying with real money and using the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega final sale" was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a company that converts bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system is similar to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented at dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat states, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to reconsider hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, by the way, in its report envisages reassessing the various risks that are now highly regarded as high risks in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their sphere of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan peasants by considering them terrorists.
And us with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as was the case in Soviet times.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans, took place properly.
The truck and tank convoys overflighted by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban influx into Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overrun by the war due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
Their takeover of power was then seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep the women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by seizing government land to sell to refugees from Iran and Pakistan as construction land, benefiting from the massive U.S. subcontracting.
They have discredited themselves, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fights.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who have benefited from American subsidies: capital flight is considerable.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls as well as boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
There is an army now.
Are the authorities under whose command it will be deemed legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already striving to restore militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization on the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the Prime Minister’s office, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make him a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not present and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
Private initiative is given priority.
In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
Rumor has spread that Afghanistan has immense resources.
This adds to the impression that the Western countries were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) are making their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s most important employers.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and boys high schools, Institute of French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a "civil-military actions" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization in order to try to "gain the hearts and spirits" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, which required a large number of local workers, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help improve local living conditions, which are very tough in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2000 meters.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which they say is their wish, it would be necessary to continue with less, more well-controlled and directly relevant civilian aid in their favour.
A Constitution with a Brechstange in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power, it has decided to put everything on one card.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this plenary two additional months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a preliminary, amended text for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only contributed to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his “autocratic delirium” by continuing to “break his word” and “tread the law with his feet.”
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as protests rage across the country.
According to affirmations in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this recourse to a hasty vote: "either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited authority", the latter supposedly should come to an end after the Constitution is adopted.
85 largely Islamist members of this Constituent Assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they turned their backs on their belief that they were unable to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 people, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum clock of the Constituent Assembly was not exactly going.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, is ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made more stringent application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The liberals, who see this only as a propaganda attack, reply “hypocrisy.”
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to checking compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing, as "the persons who are asked to make a statement have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
You can see here the first signs of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas, but academics who have been partly trained in the French system," Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition, said in a statement.
He admits, however, that there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, ed.].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide about it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticised for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of controversy: the powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the audit of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Likewise, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
Blasphemy is being maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch stresses that no longer an article refers to the protection of women.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and unspoiled nature.
AIF gives you the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
Bowing down before the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on the water, calming the sea storm and fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the sanctuaries can be found in Jerusalem.
Here, believers take the Passion Way or Cross Way of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path starts at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, where the site of the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place of the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Take a journey to the heights
The ruins of Massada fortress form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rocky wall in the mountains at an altitude of 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
All others bring a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters is the famous ski resort Hermon, which attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the mountaintop.
Visit Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited with just one trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in rock caves in the Judean desert are preserved, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There, the collection of works by impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathing servants of the time.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the Children’s Memorial, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the lands in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for health
Israel’s three main recreational areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and it is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the lowest sea in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water has a high salinity and, as a result, even non-swimmers carry on the surface without any problems.
The surrounding countryside is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt salt) and healing mud, as well as for the treatment of inflammations of the skin, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to soothe stressed nerves.
Touching the secrets of antiquity
These secrets lie in the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, passed through this city.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
Fortune, according to legend, is held by all who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newly married couples from all over Israel and even from other countries at photo meetings.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre and conquer the Crusader Fortress.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre nowadays hosts evening concerts and operas.
Watchlist for tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is preferred not in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be exchanged for shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city, you can usually travel by bus, but there is also a highway in Jerusalem and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city with the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which is enough for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is observed in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport stops.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and food that contains both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you can choose from a variety of dishes of ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel), as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
There are many well-fed cats that stray through the streets comfortably and unhindered.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the rooftops of parked cars.
Cats like busy places and don’t say no to treats.
A rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Entrance tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the US and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the visa requirement was lifted on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MPs and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with fake certificates.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families that remain in the home.
On December 1st, a law came into force that requires every working migrant to take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this regulation only applies to migrants who want to work in the services sector, the municipal housing industry and the retail sector.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
You have to pass not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language proficiency must be demonstrated both for obtaining and renewing the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas prior to the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The entirety of the examination bodies will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship of Nations, the Moscow State University, the Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, repeatedly asked the following question in the press before the law came into force: What does it all mean?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills bring, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, according to spokespersons of the migration authority, the aim is to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical expertise encounter problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who, under the pretext of help, will put him in a dark, narrow barrack, where he will endure with dozens of months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"In the homeland, you will be promised one thing, and on arrival you will be cheated, their passports will be taken off and you will not receive the promised salary," confirms the head of the Central Office for Labour Migration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't scold me, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of Central Asian republics, who want to make their money in Russia, admit that they not only do not know the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: Only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford a reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately take the first opportunity to make money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status are required to pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and consequently no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the migrant workers continue to stay illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Unauthorized access forbidden"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The Russian police staff know that our documents are largely forged and we are not registered, and this leads to cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
"Just don't shy away from costs for wrong papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the migrant’s registration documents could be counterfeit.
Some fake certificates that certify the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive it for nothing: every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs a working migrant three thousand rubles.
Both officials and civil rights activists agree that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test the first time that they will have time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered positions in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market
Proportion of legal weapons in criminal offences is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to tighten the gun law for private gun owners.
The authorities are responding to recent events: injuries in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the shooting of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and increase the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chair of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - are demanding that the authorities refrain from "senseless tightening".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Vasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from using the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, you can find any weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, says former Colonel Viktor Baránez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapon orders
The first channel is the army, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez said.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are being stolen by law enforcement officers.
Baránez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police’s armory and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons stores.
In many military camps there were frequent explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the absence of weapons," the former military official said.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
“Today, there are countless private armaments factories that do not withstand international competition and that is why they squander weapons on the black market, for example in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production of its own, sometimes artisanal, as well as a mafia that organizes smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the approximate share of each of the five channels in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the investigators, come from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are due to the "guilt of those responsible who have been involved in their work with weapons," according to the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% are due to thefts in weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant to an arms store, who does not want to be named, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have not been bought by anyone for a long time, as they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for merchants to obtain supplies in a weapons store.
A gun, for example, a TT-type pistol, is purchased through an ensign.
The weapon is placed and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros each with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything and, therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan to detect crime, periodically carry out check purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Buyers and sellers find each other most often through acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone caught my attention and suggested that I come to the station "Begovaja", where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price of the gun was only there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are merchants in the markets, but there you have to go and meet with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who tells you that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I’m even getting to some hit rings about a friend I trust.

Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baránez tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was depicted.
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are required and there are no personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," the advertisement on the website says "Buy a pistol or rifle".
There, users place their orders and make requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," asks user "Ivan" (literal citation).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Federenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are on the net.
People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible parties accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that at the end you can also go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are on the net.
"People come to feed like hungry fish and then end up in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
Makarov for $100
According to experts, the purchase of illegal firearms can be expected at prices of 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", one can buy a pistol of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is handed out in military weapons camps by middle-ranking supervisors.
According to official statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences across Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of exposed cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, fast food and supermarket workers strike
One in four American teenagers is sitting behind McDonald's at some point
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon run out of air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of forming unions.
So far, this industry of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, when sales took place in the U.S., attracting millions of customers, sometimes leading to handcuffs.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, dropped their jobs and, along with trade unions and left-wing activists, raided branches of the chain whose target audience are low- and middle-income individuals.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy in their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply only because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of severe working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday protests called for wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company’s health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 per hour could not afford that increase, they said.
Researchers from Berkeley University, California, show that if the company increased the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than they donate now for wages.
If Walmart were to completely transfer the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, this would be a mere $12.39 per year compared to today’s extra spending.
Walmart advocates are pleased to note that protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in his store from 8 a.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
Overall, Walmart cash registers performed nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post website that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees dropped the work and the protest action was merely "another PR trick" by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where, however, their target was not Walmart stores (which are unwelcome in this progressive city and therefore so far inexistent), but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet they don't give you sick days, and you're not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, their ordinary employees in New York get $8.90 per hour.
No one deserves less than her in this expensive city.
How it is possible to live in New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American youths were behind the counter after school at McDonald's, but the youths still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly encounter people complaining that they are getting along with this salary and sometimes even having to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, more than doubling the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
U.S. law forbids corporate governance from standing in the way of this goal and admonishing or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protests was a noon meeting in front of McDonald's in Times Square where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet you're not granted sick days, and you're not paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast food employees so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, not all of whom are employed by far in the fast food industry, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet foreseeable whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
So far, the brain can only be moderately outwitted.
Popular among fans of modern technologies, the topic of augmented reality is usually perceived lately by the lens of special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses were just a transit station for the company’s scientists.
It appeals to the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens that are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are an advance, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect because everyone is interested in motion control.
- What can we expect in the future?
Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, a lot of things are still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output so far not decisive.
We try to change that, working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, this requires that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier.
And first of all, we should get rid of these silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's popular, but isn't it overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone around you about your actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and concise gestures rather than expansive gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- For example, would you ask me to pass you this bubble can?
They say it and point it out at the same time.
- Normally I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does this mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and cannot do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's about a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work primarily on developing new sensor types that will allow us to capture people’s reactions more accurately.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they provide a good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- What are your requirements for modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
Not only the resolution along the X- and Y-axis, but also along the Z-axis must be taken into account.
The speed and the number of images per second are also important.
Man's movements are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps are too little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond lab with an adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work, I needed exactly that kind of device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently operates with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or worsen the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how that helps us determine a position in three dimensions.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that when it comes to applying the technology of augmented reality in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think this: the best variant would be a "changing" extended reality, where we could switch from glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and in this lies their strength (only you can see private things), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality using glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What are the answers your group wants to give to this objection?
In my lectures, I often speak of expanded reality as the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection pad.
She perceives pressure excellently!
However, there are also technologies that are actually oriented to give the "images in the air" something tangible, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is currently still as weak as if someone was blowing over the palms.
There are also ligaments for the wrist that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Did you try to outsmart the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), movable platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately outwitted, and we still have many busy years ahead of us.
This is exactly what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: We are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburger Avantgarde" project, dedicated to city dwellers who are the avant-garde of art and culture.
High-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and which often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, landed on the exquisite list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bearded one, which you can find at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are on display, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburgan social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, puts a smile on the face of his fellow citizens and ensures a good mood for them.
Recently, he grabbed a revolving organ and became a St. Petersburg revolving organ player, as he felt finally ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistic existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that deviates slightly from the norm of cruelty causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to get in touch with people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were on display.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonevchina"; this resulted in "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was finished.
I am drawn to theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything, except literature.
It was important to me to be at the center of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists were supposed to gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemian, the house of the Petersburg Bohemian, until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for the playback, wore tight jerseys and among them was the now-fashioned composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the art clinic.
Our staff and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture still meant something.
In the year 2000, there was a press survey about the award "Personals of our city".
I won in the "Artist of the Year" category, and I was at my peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In modern times, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my paintings are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be like that.
In a clown, all this blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone is paying attention to the clothes and orienting themselves on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But maybe you shouldn’t give a man a hand, but rather spit in his face.
Deception disappears through dressing.
Recently, we saw you in the role of an urban organ player, and a cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We are witnessing the decay of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one-hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- The performances of Stas Mikhailov will be attended by several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, consequently there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not destroy what is achieved.
In my youth I painted such paintings, which in a collector even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually don’t come until the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It is called: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that’s something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
It is said: Servants of culture.
However, not all of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real tsars, because the tsars may not understand much about culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some that could be experts, but they are being blocked the way, as higher-ranking experts are needed to properly assess the former and pave the way for them.
Now only one's own taste counts.
The same goes for the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and that some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art is hard to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who attend exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's a lot less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer steroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth dwellers on board set off in search of a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises, how can we reproduce in weightlessness or on the substitute planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Notably Mars and Venus," says the scientist at the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, a temperature of 500 degrees prevails on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first dealt with with regard to the flora.
Half a century before that, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of orbitally grown peas did not differ in any way from the earthly species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects embryo development.
It develops a very normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a hold; it has to be able to stand on its legs and start to move," explains the laboratory leader of the Institute of Medical Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without a solid surface, the chicks overwhelmed themselves wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn completely blunted.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Twice we let chicks hatch and then set the whole thing up because it is simply impossible to work with them there," notes Vladimir Sychev on the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized sent into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to continue," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals ripped out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive instincts.
Unlike animals, humans can do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Will she survive the spaceflight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"After all, no one answered that question," says space veteran Wattang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaya, who was twice in orbit and even performed work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts who did well after long flights and had healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is, even on flights in orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity must look for new paths in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydro lab in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here, in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even though adults find water pleasant, it is a strange environment; however, infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders were testifying that life on the land escaped the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that a child is in the mother's belly in amniotic fluid for about 9 months, and that it can then more easily get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since only 2 weeks pass from birth to the first swim.
"This is not enough time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
So, while for a newborn child, weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman does not live without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles recover enormously quickly and thus the ability to squeeze the child out also decreases.
All right, let's get around this with birth-initiating aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the attraction of the earth, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in a stress suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is essential to his life.
"This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will result in us giving birth to a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person," says Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical Biological Problems at the RAN.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
Eventually, however, it will become a reality when the Earth’s inhabitants set out in their spaceships to a distant planet that will become the home for their offspring born in space.
NK<0xC3><0x9A>-Chef: Control of the Black System Fails Due to Politics
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in the context of public procurement, but fails to apply them.
In an interview for Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvy<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>í kontrollní ú<0xC5><0x99>ad, NK<0xC3><0x9A>), Miloslav Kala, says this.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I don't think this is the case with us," Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be achieved by a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls – so is the system now prohibited or allowed?
“A law must be valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, hinder its activity,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public procurement were compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is about the European legislative system determining how public contracts are to be handled. On this basis the national legislations are based. And finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all of these, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have found extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws in our country may even be a little "stricter and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again. One also has to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project for you?
Precisely such joint control could help us to stop constantly striving to perfect the laws and to lower and equilibrate thresholds when this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
Perhaps it’s even that we’re only burdening the system with excessive “paper crap” in this way, and those looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there a similar authority here as our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9A> is the Federal Court of Auditors, which has a similar structure to ours and also has a college that is formed only slightly differently.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, although Germany is a federal state, i.e. there are these courts of account also in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds administered by the districts and municipalities are there under the control of the State Audit Courts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this without concrete information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a model in some respects, but you can certainly not say that Germany is better at all.
Is it because the testers are better?
I don't think so, but as I said, I don't like comparisons like that.
It should also be noted that those countries, which are an example for us, are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they would not have any cooperation with our agency, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what significance did the amendment of the Public Procurement Act have for your authority, do you feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novel is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an impact on our examinations.
Since our checks take place retrospectively, a certain delay is to be expected here.
So far, we are more likely to experience effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of risks of ineconomicity" and examined and analyzed almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will of course have an impact as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you think the adoption of this law is more positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, there may be the problem that the rules become "strenger" and can no longer be adhered to.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to audit are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) in such a way that any non-compliance with the public procurement law constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I do not think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a formal flaw that does not affect the actual decision making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First, let’s say which path is not appropriate.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not trouble entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system forbidden or allowed?
A law must be valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, hinder its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say we're pretending nothing.
The Public Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic when the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what I think is missing from us.
On the roads there is occasionally ice, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is snow and ice.
The roads are mainly easy to drive, however, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were easy to navigate this morning, snow and ice were smooth from time to time.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should be a bit warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
On the crests of the Ore Mountains, however, there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and the first-class roadways in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the roadways are sometimes iced and smooth.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, ice or extended snow remains in sections.
Therefore, increased attention is required, especially in the higher layers.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger because of ice, at higher altitudes and in the mountains there is sometimes an extended layer of snow on the roads, the road and motorway directorate informs on its website.
The road championships warn drivers of ice smoothness, which can occur especially in higher elevations in the Pardubice district.
Glazed ice can be found in particular on second and third class roads in the districts of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies at altitudes on the roads of the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely rainless.
The temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen
The roads in the district of Plze<0xC5><0x88> are now easily accessible, but local attention is needed and the driving style must be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures have fallen afterwards, ice can slip on the roads.
Local fog is also to be expected, but the visibility will improve over the course of the day.
This data comes from the district roadmasters.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but increased attention is recommended between the 80th and the 131st kilometre.
The roads of the first class are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice can come in sections.
The roadways of the second and third class are moist, and therefore the reference to possible ice sections applies here too.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Today, drivers who are heading towards the elevations in the Olomouc district have to expect snowfall.
After the use of scattering vehicles, snow mass remains on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass and on the road in the direction of Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>.
Nightly snowshoeing forced the street masters to use, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of fresh snow fell in the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district.
In the other areas of the district, the roadways are usually unrestrictedly accessible.
"In the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district, there are still snow residues in the elevations.
On the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass, drivers have to expect snowfall in the direction of Jeseník," an employee of the road administration <0xC5><0xA0>umperk told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK agency today.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to go out at night, according to them, the roads are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc county, the roads are fully accessible, but in <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk county, drivers have to drive cautiously in forest sections, as the roads here are still humid.
<0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem district, Liberec district
In northern Bohemia, the roadmasters report several sections of roads that are difficult to drive.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district of <0xC3><0x9A>stí n.K. is closed according to the traffic police.
Temperatures remain below zero even at lower altitudes, so snow and ice will stay on the roads, but no problems are reported from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Lower Mountains, and the roads are usually dry.
So far, no traffic disturbances have been reported.
Glazed ice is reported in particular from the surrounding area of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - rain and melting snow during the day, cloudless skies and frost at night.
Poor traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from I/13 at the border of the districts <0xC3><0x9A>stí n.L. and Liberec.
The blocking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches pressed from the snow load to the road.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we humans like to respond to.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more likely to make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a national charity event that we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is predicted for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be about the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
From whom does this idea come?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once hand this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and keyrings against the end of the world, which people can also support with their purchase through www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap has also recorded, together with other performers, the so-called anthem against the end of the world with the title "Weltuntergang fällt aus".
Today, the anthem is already very popular on YouTube. Will it also be heard at the charity concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world does not happen...
The anthem will be sung by all performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
In addition, the hymns will be broadcast live together in a direct circuit from Czech TV.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we organize many charity events and concerts...
We make every effort to get these people involved in our projects.
It turned out that most people are interested in working with us and enjoying it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the accessible educational centre Studeo, on which we have been working for six years together with the association Tap in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
Students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly supervised by editors who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the editors, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building will be built, into which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What criteria did you choose?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> perform.
More information can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar “great events” planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would also like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not very small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have to carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked so far without problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I sometimes wondered sometimes already.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travels abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than we do, we have just witnessed in Russia that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not accessible to people with disabilities. There, it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair to travel alone in the city center.
It is not even self-evident there that a wheelchair user is left in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things we hang out in afterwards...
However, it should also be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to also be able to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly common that a larger group of disabled people actively participate in social events there, in this we are with the band The Tap Tap a little ahead of the West!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out of our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular right now, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a supervisor at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensively.
And since I am a musician myself and plays saxophone, I founded a music company together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, is accustomed to say, it gets a bit out of control (laughs).
But the band has only been known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It’s true that working with well-known singers has helped us, and we’ve also started actively promoting ourselves.
We have become aware that if you are doing something and this is not visible on the outside, your own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good editors, high-quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to be able to do things differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, as everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; this is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full-fledged life and develop, provided they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, it is a progress not only for them but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you be a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and also have to demand some discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic performances, and when they find that they have rehearsals twice a week, have to go through preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm for many quickly goes out.
But this is how it works everywhere, in any band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them have been involved since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group. People come and go. You can't stop that.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 21:00
Venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected via live circuit and there is a common interpretation of the hymn "The end of the world falls out" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the provision of a multifunctional disability-friendly educational centre, which will be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Admission costs CZK 400, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency (ESA) at a Council of Ministers meeting of the European Space Agency (ESA), making it the second member of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The way of Poland into space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts engaged in space travel, but they did not always come across an understanding.
I recall here, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the Earth-facing side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or to brake the draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered missiles.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
Traditional documents show that research has reached the stage of practical testing.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, a photoelectric hunting rocket design by Ing. Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared in the specialist press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky was published.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects on the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was ended at the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Agency (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society occurs in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was anticipated that space exploration would have a future.
Already in its inception in 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the 1951 founded International Federation of Space, and in fact the PTA became a regular member as early as in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation of Space.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 began flight tests in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>dów Desert with the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this rocket, which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a 0.4-liter transport space, Meteor-1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight altitude for all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on charitable works.
This decision sparked a lively public discussion.
It is interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause of this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), price tensions arise.
This term refers to a situation in which the manufacturer attempts to compete economically by importing favourable goods by "undercutting" competition in order to gain a larger market share and increase profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to relocate their production abroad or buy cheaply there, or to quit their business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparablely high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is further aggravated by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they cause to society as a whole.
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own people to private capital regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the restriction of workers' rights.
The result is increasing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for several years, who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regularly cases in which employees receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their income to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures taken by virtually all EU southern states will undoubtedly result in the same condition where people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level, or to live on the edge of society for a starvation wage, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
This naturally raises the question of where this capital comes from.
If it comes from another EU country, poverty simply moves from one country to another; or the capital stays completely out, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all, the workers work for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to the exasperation that the state is not allowed to participate in its own national economy with capital, and that a planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists narrowly on its view that the state must not intervene steeringly in the economy.
Then one has to wonder, however, whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually almighty lobby that is omnipresent in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual preference, a legislation in which practically everything is punishable but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that, due to a lack of finances, a state ministry commissions private legal firms closely intertwined with the industry with the preparation of draft laws.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Apparently, the liberal democracies are currently quickly in a situation as described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman republic in the times of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been in disintegration, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribes, through unlawful concealment of advantages, or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew rampant, and the people went to the election with votes already bought" ... "People with character did not apply for office, so that the state had not had a consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "It was already really started to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sovereignty, and that a strong man then had to be elected by the C...
As it turns out, today’s society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is by its very nature incapable of recognizing and enforcing the advantage for the whole society.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who are not at all striving for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's standpoint, the downfall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, during which the next round is already looming.
Especially disastrous is the fact that today’s elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is systematic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state’s capital participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "...so that we may not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be none," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, a myriad of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense while denoting the Palestinians as terrorists; others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed on the Palestinian Arabs, and describe the state of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write here about who is the culprit and the victim in these recurring waves of killing; in the end, the present inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the onset of violence itself.
It’s my job to give readers a behind-the-scenes look at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are especially useful to.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and arise from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost a story of the struggle for power.
In any epoch we can identify one Alexander the Great or one Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their deeds to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power did not arise within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be called the Head of the Kraken (I don’t know if anyone else is above them, but I don’t rule this out) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 1990s to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which there was always the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in central banks, they wage wars or arm themselves on them (before the raid on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the raid on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, with Russia in the meantime submitting its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild’s Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (pronounced: state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed – he was murdered in 1963; MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after trying to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
The Rothschild’s global desire for power led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars in 1859-1871 by Albert Pik, a Mason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war in particular was to break the colonial rule of Britain, and the third war is to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comforts and their luxury and would also not consume as many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is here absolutely leading to the takeover of power).
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is to trigger a crisis and subsequently offer a solution (order ab chao – order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed so that crises like the one they triggered in 1907 do not repeat).
After the assassination of the Habsburg heir to the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Tsar Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militaryly and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Tsar Empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to ignite the Second World War more easily, the bankers allowed politics to create a latent conflict situation by occupying Germany with gigantic war reparations; thereby they created the precondition of impoverished masses, so that they only had to applaud the Germans a sufficiently strong leader, who named the guilty and offered a strong and simple solution; another factor was the creation of the multi-people
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke away from the chain on which the international bankers initially held him, or whether everything was going according to plan, was difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be a victim in the front line, similar to World War II, this time along with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think how sharply the people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, where at the beginning was the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and their leadership here, since the international bankers in Israel, as well as in our country, are choosing exclusively their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel, the Falcon Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist prone, loyal to international bankers, politician who does everything to spark a war with Iran, which could rapidly turn into a global conflict, because of the membership of Iran in the Shanghai World Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...) and because of the fact that Iran is only about 20 percent of the world’s population.
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
The New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to put this being under total control.
"And it causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bondmen, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads; that no one may buy or sell, save he that hath the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: let him that hath understanding consider the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When It's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had maintained patronage over his regime for decades.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt at hostage liberation only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages evoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy officials managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, while an extravagant story helped them conceal their true identity – travelling with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff that allegedly visited the country's filming locations for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to make the camouflage credible, articles about this film project appeared in professional journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret, and the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful piece of Hussars such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels in the film alternate - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly overshadowed.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, in the office hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable relaunch of his career with this film.
A smiling actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime novel No Kindle (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film not set in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The feel for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that set the previous films of this director apart from the standard of Hollywood.
However, Affleck also proves this sense in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the opening sequence of the assault on the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet still conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team also have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the wrong film rod on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
With the little he works quite successfully, but sometimes he helps with reality - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a phone call in America, or the chase on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide dispersion, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserved more space, and they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses a bit of traction, and it’s a film that you can follow with a certain interest, while gouting the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70s.
However, it is difficult to awaken enthusiasm.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history that is alive to this day in a certain way and as a proof of how overwhelming the notions of the almighty and omniscient intelligence services are.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovniploplatky.com, which calls out a survey on the most absurd bank fees every year, has decided this year to host the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This is the idea behind the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a 40% women's share in the management of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organizing this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk for the insurance companies.
“More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include the binding addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is consequently naturally harmful, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the Directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
Criticism in the past also reaps the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels are usually represented by one or more member states (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks even with veto threats).
Lobbying interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not have any "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonizing the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU has already softened the norms on fruit and vegetables against the opposition of some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
One candidate for victory in this poll may be last year’s EU regulation, which, according to balloons on sale, must be provided with the notice that children under the age of eight are not allowed to inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU cited an American study that, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fairground sausages.
Curiose incidents also occur at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who holds an official position in the EU is not allowed to use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and instead has to say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists, nominated Laissez Faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, also the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has thus set the maximum amount of food supplies that could be on the day of our accession to the EU in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for mushroom cans, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving grants for applications for grants.
These ideas, of course, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we don't have an ocean.
We will apply for reimbursement to the EU," said <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas in autumn 2004.
He argued that the cereal harvest was very high and that the state warehouses were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another route to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally reached the point where it organised a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), offered grants for applications for grants to the municipalities, in particular for the application of grants to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, some experts believe that the EU’s efforts to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve more recognition.
A more serious problem, in the opinion of these experts, is the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been enforced by individual member states during the budget negotiations.
In this country, emotions also evoke the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member states in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky" after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the indigenous rum (Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
The term rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or the Parmas ham now also includes the Karlovy Vary zwieback, carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or the Saazer hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>icer rolls can boast.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr. Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I wouldn’t be running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the republic being looted for 20 years, thieves running around freely, while people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something that I don’t like, I try to suggest a solution to change that.
And since I’m over 40, and I’m independent and no party, I have no choice but to run for the office of a senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then went straight to the castle.
Isn’t that turning your back on your voters?
I've been saying to myself all along that I'm going to start the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would run for the office of president if I were elected as a senator.
But my goal is not the function, the function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people, in the pub and in front of the TV, are taunting anyone who wants to change.
In addition, the media, who want to rob you of your honor, and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed about me that I would bribe journalists or that I was an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
You have started the battle for the castle with the thesis of the substantive and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations of over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As president, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked hard to ensure that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless person, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country, without any drawer thinking and party dogmas.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics more to the right or to the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me more to the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It’s not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You don’t like someone calling you populist.
But aren't you confirming that by what you just said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And you want to approach this.
This can be called populism because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you have only tags.
In the long run, this does not go far in politics.
Or do you mean that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing substantive and criminal liability?
I have no other choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and trying to get them on our side to achieve these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to enact substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And then they would have to say why they reject it.
A strong personality that points to abuses can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn’t work, I’ll go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I do not achieve anything on my own; therefore, I have spoken with several well-known personalities about whether they also want to run for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who declined because of work overload.
I also supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who revealed the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I’m not sure.
Sixty percent of the eligible voters did not go to the elections at all, and those who went mostly voted representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are just two independents.
People have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district chiefs.
Are you thinking about forming your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the past of every potential party member, and I don’t have the money to do so.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You are talking about asset statements, what would yours look like?
I estimate my private assets at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb worth about a million. And then I have a few million in account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child's dream - I always liked James Bond, driving in the car, gallant with women, and at the same time fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and don’t have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign from my own funds.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator's salary alone; I could not, for example, finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your livelihood?
Didn't you say you're going to go back to these activities?
But that doesn’t relate to the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will be managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that continues to be the case.
As President, however, I would cease my activities altogether.
The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the mind - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a nearby large-scale company, says: "But it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of these old-style libraries voluntarily today, right?
Spijkenisse, a hardly visitable sleeping city on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-population community has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this stupid circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general education and to recreate the seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro notes as beautifully brushed reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of the bold bar diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual serenity and appeared for the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury looked around, stunned, and shrugging their arms, the cheeky Maas piled his exquisite souvenirs of greatness into a pyramid and ended his actionist-supported speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So that is it, my proposal for the Buchberg von Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain is spilled.
It is part of a revitalization project that includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjoining residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Buchenberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless small town restaurant, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian street and a stunned ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: Book Torado under cheese bell.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true pleasures of space and reading open up as you climb the topography on foot.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lights unmistakably speak the language of a public square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves are located along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and pushed the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the center are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and house technology center.
A special joy are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes parapets, sometimes stair railings.
Optics, feel and smell are foreign.
Even industrious architects and civil engineers shake their heads at the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so one day we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
For many years, in the Netherlands, a millimetre-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root pad in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile lasts for one or two seasons, after which it is ripe for bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these quantities - to plates four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells like a new car and a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long hike, the Literaturcafé not only offers a fantastic view of the city, but also rewards you with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide an atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the Bücherberg stands under a glass fall, the sun shines only briefly in the interior, even on sunny days.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand across the glass facade, serve as shadows and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already dared to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg Spijkenisses "long overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
For the time being, this is intended to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has opened up.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV has succeeded in the royal discipline that is called the Identity Foundation in the technical jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
No matter how young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing at a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
Then Berlin abstained.
- Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany has to be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is changing its foreign policy, away from a policy managed by the US, so to speak, to a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still touching on their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy like they have France or Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy actually mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to push the public, but also the elites, into the head in the Arab countries.
That definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn't put too much weight on it either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the US.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Maybe Germany will even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that as an international player, it must be taken seriously and its interests must be taken into consideration.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly voted in favour of a veto.
Are there disagreements between the United States and many European nations?
Due to American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think that the Obama administration secretly has quite a bit of understanding for the European position.
But due to the political situation here, of course, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual disagreements are not as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other hand?
I think that’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can’t be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, even because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans understand that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role as an important international player – does Germany even want to take a leading role?
Or is Germany still struggling to take the lead?
Germany is not yet accustomed to it, this is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German feelings become free.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In that sense, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be receptive to different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is steadily decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a name officially registered in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the originating companies.
Yet it enjoys protection as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
And even then, it is not clear if they are right.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s law firm, who specializes in intellectual property infringements in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters to register their trademarks.
So Gucci becomes simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have to enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, for example the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and injuring intellectual property is well known.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch’s cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he opposes the fact that Chinese companies are officially granted the right by the Trademark Office to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," demands Pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the sole proprietorship disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and litigation costs of the affected industries go to the millions, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third-largest luxury product market and the fastest-growing one, with a volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion a year.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into money.
The procedure can last for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court dismissed claims because after the long duration of the disputed name had become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he even has to pay the plagiarist money because he violated his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails.
Famous cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The trade mark office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks in 2010 because of too little personnel and room equipment.
Last year, however, one had “returned from the emergency situation in the workflow to normality.”
The number of unprocessed opposition proceedings has decreased by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 appeals are still pending in the office.
To tackle this costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new applications worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
Simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To tackle this costs many times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was excavated.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
They themselves have failed to do so, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office CTMO also rejected the appeal by the Munich residents.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the defendant continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident in bringing the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archives even had to look through one hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
“You can see how much this is worth to us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are threatening to swing back to Europe.
Then when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business area, but it was still able to avert the registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very cautious when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, foreigners should "registrate anything that is somehow worth protecting in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay royalties to the other side for your own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are delighted.
The history of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell up - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - harass, seduce and persecute each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his supple wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the Hausmann.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choral voice has a different text and this in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Worldwide, there are around 34 million HIV-infected, according to UNAIDS, the United Nations’ programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
Swaziland is home to 245000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found godparents in Germany.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take on a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a hot meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi in Zulu means storyteller or praiser.
The Bantu language can be spoken fluently in this room but no one can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
The village of Esitjeni, located 8,733 kilometres away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, depends on the power of the German choir to voice.
40% are infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, what the whole of Swaziland is suffering from: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying in their mid-30s is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school, you have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human Pappilomaviruses, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Felt aphids and scabies are among the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), tripper and human pappilomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - nevertheless: About 20 percent of HIV new infections account for this group.
Chlamydia infections occur much more frequently among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, Human Pappilomaviruses are also common among adolescents.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of venereal disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, lower abdomen pain, as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100% protection.
Because in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and late consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and not least the salaries that the choir sings all over Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chair of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also takes care of the orphans, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the Zulu women are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans with them, giving them a roof over their heads and ensuring that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school lessons every day.
Anyone who has no one can go to the shelter in Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid just as much by the association as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has established a sewing school, built two chicken houses and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized that many in the village have had an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, one prefers to keep it silent.
A king with 14 wives
“Aids is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
It's actually strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
While free condoms would be available at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another – flesh to flesh.”
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels together through the south of Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of grief, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many on the southern tip of the black continent still know from apartheid times.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also ripped some tears off some grim border soldiers.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you hardly find the small village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
“Go to Esitjeni, there’s the light,” people say.
And if you return the 8733 kilometer airline to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it glowing there too.
NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shadowy region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets, or possibly asteroids, that struck Mercury.
"No one is associating the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet," said Messenger probe chief scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth’s inhabitants, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send pictures to Earth: small observation holes in infinite distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto orbiting the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's new definition of 2006.
This section of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars can be recognized as blue dots, harder to identify the pink-colored "newborns" in the star circle room.
This star-forming region - unromanticly called W5 by scientists - has been discovered by the telescope Spitzer in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has been captured by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star ejected during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors become more prominent.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebula looks forward to the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its similarity to an earthly continent earned this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular color scheme.
This baby star in its full beauty could only be captured by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid derives from the Latin word trifidus (three-split, three-split), as dark dust stripes divide the glowing heart of the star birthplace into three parts.
In the constellation Snake Bearers, astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are racing towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star-birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who are not technical abbreviations may call them Southern Fire Wheel by their nickname.
The image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The nebula, which is 1400 light-years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the space telescope Hubble for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
Inside this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The Sternenwiege is always producing new youngsters.
Also, this star cloud, connected with the Rosette Nebula, is constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it originated shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever larger – and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows viewing into space at the same time via two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone reaches 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable construction: The telescope is tightened in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high light collecting power.
In spite of a comparatively small mirror diameter, this is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are monitoring the universe for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
This is where the Very Large Telescope stands, which lives up to its name.
With its total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also being planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is expected to be 42 meters long - and composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images should be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is still looking into the sky next to them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
A new, huge telescope is also to be created on the Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is on an illustration to admire.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been delivering images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets – mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planet candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
The last launch preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope are documented in the image.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the big bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger is much closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
With the Messenger probe launched in 2004 – the first to orbit Mercury – the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day and live to be 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains is to be called wild romantic.
The minibus rumbles across the winding road, past densely wooded hills, ripping rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talys, which is not much known about, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijani and is very durable.
The final stop is Lerik.
The small town boasts overwhelming architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the journey from Azerbaijan’s capital Baku is too arduous.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one-lane.
The fabulous wealth that the land owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the world's oldest people here," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, arguably the only one in the world.
Here is the vita of about eight dozen talys from the area documented, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child was born.
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented human being, who lived to be 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems extremely dubious.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136, he is said to have had a daughter.
So did <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov set off a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
"Strikingly, there are also many high-aged people in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "extremely many very old men also live in Sardinia."
However, due to the lack of documents, there was no scientific proof of age, especially as there was a lack of civil status registers.
Every day melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik strikingly often reach a biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why are so many old people living here in the south?
The Azerbaijani travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is food.
But the fact that the high-calorie food of the talys should be so healthy, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not seem exactly plausible from a nutritional scientific point of view.
In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives, but it is the original way of life that keeps people young.
At the age of 97, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butterfly barrel that rolls her back and forth tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two toddlers are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, guests can prepare tea, which is served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly lined, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out to me and kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo, either," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven’t bought food in a supermarket all my life.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from an old woman’s mouth.
But the cult, which is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijani’s elderly.
230 manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-grown son is right: “The elderly enjoy respect in our culture.”
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human rights” is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with sharia as its basis is heavily controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God-state on the Nile by graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Almost apologizing, Mohamed Morsi said, he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers to “save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are aware of, the world is not entirely clear.
Should the judiciary be removed?
In fact, the 234 articles that were whipped through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constitutional Assembly in a nightly, 15-hour parforce ride are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the spongy wording and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least one new article: in all matters pertaining to Sharia law, the Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great radiance in all of Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be done, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto result in the dismantling of the judiciary.
Much in the draft draft is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served to suppress opposition during Mubarak’s rule.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
The state should also, according to the draft, “protect the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote their morality and values.”
This is legally so blurred that state institutions could even control the contents of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In a nutshell, this means nothing more than censorship.
No article explicitly states the equality of men and women.
Another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Likewise, the wording that “insulting people” is forbidden is dubious.
Is it enough to have a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation, as so much is in the draft, which Morsi is present for signature and, according to his words, will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum "very soon".
“The revolution has returned.”
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unfamiliar harmony at Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday evening, vowing to bring the Charter down before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and ex-chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft constitution belongs “to the rubbish pile of history.”
On Twitter, he accused Morsi of wanting to lead a “putch against democracy.”
"If he declares the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew up for counter-demonstration, but as a precaution, not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists took part, shouting, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi, "Cleave the land!" and asserted, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A battle for supremacy over the emblematic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have probably evoked civil war-like conditions.
Obviously, Mursi's followers didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the proponents had expressed themselves loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the Islamist draft is deemed to be secure.
"The word human rights doesn't even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone through February and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complained in an interview with the "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi’s extension of power to all three powers in the state caused the lawyer to resign.
These measures are flagrant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto overturns it," Saeda said.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological directional struggle on the Nile with a mix of curiosity and tension.
It could take revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns, "You are giving birth to a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most nasty fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards – not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret to success have anything to do with the local appetite for pretty bad-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the midst of a pile of dirty, moist sportswear.
Leave it there for a week.
One must imagine the anesthetizing smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and that stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt that ferments in water for up to a year, depending on how stinky you would like your fish to be.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this, well, really, very captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire station, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk general".
People around us eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I'm going to try some appetizers.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk near your nose, it’s not bad – like sushi, which has a pretty long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling options and fish was soaked in airtight salt water barrels in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then taken out after long fermentation and - undoubtedly using alcohol-damped senses - consumed.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians in search of work were forced to leave their country and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and comprehensive healthcare.
Even from Sweden, the old rival who was far richer than Norway not too long ago, immigrants flock.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - an essential, albeit strictly smelling, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t get into the world press often, and most people don’t seem to bother.
Anders Breivik is the racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "July 22 incident".
Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Mainly responsible for Norway’s current wealth since the early 1970s has been the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with mature rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and stinging blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a cautious people.
Your English is immaculate, just like most people here.
We are not very assertive, we do not like bragging.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very cautiously – a large part of the industry’s income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the Great Depression, everyone threw money around them that they did not own at all, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and ask for another dish - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
A moose burger like that is definitely something else. The juicy meat makes me feel good.
But in the evening, the stink fish is on the menu again.
The hotel I’m staying at is one of several venues that organize a rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best – or perhaps the most challenging – fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jurgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict mist of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico’s future president Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC’s Will Grant analyzes the challenges facing him and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly poor.
Even on better days, this city is always clogged, but on Monday a steel ring was erected, which blocks several important traffic routes into the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
The goal, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new President Enrique Peña Nieto will receive the presidential tie and take the lead of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has proven itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before reaching an equal position with the US president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, people like to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute it to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represent a major improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with his name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and ongoing changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Peña Nieto party, the PRI.
In particular, in terms of security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high expectations for Enrique Peña Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, dozens of murdered women have been left dead on a patch of wasteland near a large landfill.
During the reign of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics of Pena Nieto believe that he has at least not addressed the problem of women's killings during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the degraded neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with the tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her life partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the corpse rigidity had already been used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down at us from the wall. It is attached to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But this, according to the family, has been denied to her so far.
The authorities treated me as if I were a talker, a troublemaker, a noisy.
They want you to simply accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible when there were so many formal flaws and omissions,” she says.
When President Peña Nieto receives the presidential leash on Saturday, he will also take on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes in the last six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this issue during his term in office.
"I hope as president he is as he was as governor," said Olvera, a member of the PRI Congress, in Valle del Bravo.
But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
The prosecution claims Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecution contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he was mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a dismissal of the indictment on the grounds of too harsh detention conditions
U.S. Army Soldier Accused of Stealing Thousands of Confidential Documents
The prosecution tried on Friday to establish that Army Freeman Bradley Manning — accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history — missed several occasions to complain about the alleged abuse he allegedly suffered in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that documents on weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning’s nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to dismiss the indictment - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard jail term - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein went through with Manning the forms that officials had filled out after their meetings with Manning during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he had been imprisoned from July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced detention conditions.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein questioned him on the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, Fein said, contained no complaints about abuse, although officials had directly questioned Manning about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns verbally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they would deal with them, but they had not been logged.
"They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) 'no problems', and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to downgrade his observation status to “prevent injury.”
The military testified that it had assigned it to this restrictive status – which is one level below the risk of suicide – for his own and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and get rid of the observational status for injury prevention (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest and relocation to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to Quantico Marine Base Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait and had been unconscious due to the heat.
Not being allowed to know what is happening to him or the outside world was burdensome.
"My world shrank on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell — at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours — and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
If he had turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, they would have woken him up so that he would turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's attorney formally appealed Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the Military Prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning on an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico for one night and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
When interviewed on Friday, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night and had previously tried to show an official that he was not posing a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the waistband of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning testified, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take his detention experiences into account and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted at his trial in the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will confess to minor offenses, while other charges that are deemed too extreme will be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. Prosecutors are expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all detainees detained under the highest security precautions in Quantico.
Manning’s charges include favoring the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence information on the Internet, the transmission of national defense information, and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they evoke hard times in their minds, he says
Navarrete believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when perplexity spread within me.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of where to go.
I grew up in Central California and have been called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians."
Later, I decided to go for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home, there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have a native speaker’s vocabulary, and I don’t get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and lined up for extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans today are just as likely to stay in Mexico than to emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Peña Nieto vowed to continue Mexico’s war on the drug cartels, even though he did not give any details on this.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country’s leadership to leave more than half of their territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes even the mildest criticism of Mexico, you hear – in the Mexican press and among the country’s elites – complaints about how the Americans are threatening the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma embark on the war path.
And yet, in reality, Mexico’s biggest challenge lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at one point in our pedigree, a person — perhaps a parent or grandparent — was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our allegiance is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may have now lived the American dream, attended good schools, and gotten good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live – not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that tensions exist between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are – and Mexican-Americans are taking this to heart.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of belonging neither to one country nor to another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and sections of the educational bourgeoisie want to re-establish their ties to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional “ambassadors” to Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well, now.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through that alone, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge about how their family members were treated not so long ago.
- Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such a hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual blaming, countless buildings have been laid to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed – and for the first time rockets from Gaza have been hit near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East around them is changing.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not – Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standstill could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems far from appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week’s fights have strengthened the hardened on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though its group itself suffered major losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have been enclosed in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to attract powerful and wealthy friends to its side.
Turkey, a re-established regional power once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken sides for Hamas – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah holds power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist nature could face the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt – by far the most populous and important Arab country – on the southern flank of Israel has sustainably changed the region’s balance.
Hosni Mubarak, the laicist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is tied to Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States is steadfast in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has been doing well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers – not least thanks to the barriers that run into the West Bank and thus into the main part of any Palestinian state – protecting Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal but are continuing to expand.
Netanyahu’s Likud party allied itself with an even more combative group in the run-up to the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these devious Palestinians also cheat and leave them with a state of their own?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire missiles just like their fellow Gazans?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall at bay and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could be a blow to them.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments repair their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Morsi joined forces with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign — and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think long-term.
As the rest of the Arab world takes timid steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder barrel that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to push back Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly take their diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside.
The correct answer is that represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and this newspaper: two states where Israel surrenders territories for security purposes.
The hope – small for the near future – is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, along with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms supplies to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also push Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also play his part in persuading Israel to negotiate.
During his first term in office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he is equally reluctant to participate.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian legislation on uniform cigarette packaging enters into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and infants and children affected by cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font, will be on Saturday.
Australia is implementing the world’s most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian government wants to stop young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
Studies have shown that people who haven’t started smoking at 26 are 99% more likely to stop smoking afterwards.
"You can see from a young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a slight impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favor the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, notes that demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover the intolerable packaging has risen tremendously since corporations British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed to challenge the laws at the Supreme Australian Court two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
This is a good deal for us.
According to experts, the catch in the popularity of social media lies with exactly the population group that the plan is targeting.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from appearing as sports sponsors, and forced most retailers to stop laying out cigarettes in stores.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising from local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Those who market tobacco and have only a small area left to promote their products won’t get around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has noticed an increase in brand experiences written by “very normal people.”
You have to ask yourself: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that she even records a video for it - or does a marketing agency have anything to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of focusing on marketing, the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of the countries engages in major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to issue photographic warnings in 2001.
In the meantime, these have been expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a tilt and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill up its shelves.
"I used to need an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said to each other 'okay, that's it, we're closing down,'" he added.
In a constantly electrified world, it is nice to be bored sometimes
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane went down due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to think about getting bored.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us — and our kids — to be bored occasionally.
In this way, the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting thought processes, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost constantly stare at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
Should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah, yeah.
And no, no.
I will come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't see it that way.
“In fact, boredom has a very long history,” he says.
Pompeii’s house walls adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After long reading of research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience of “wanting to do a satisfactory job but not being able to do it”.
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy but wants to be.
In apathy, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a “disturbance of the attention process coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time is only passing slowly.”
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions might be related, bored individuals see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed individuals see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, even if we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German for example: "The idle mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content; others heard it at low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the hardly audible television said they felt more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, could not find a reason for them, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, disturbing attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you do a monotonous activity - "such as searching for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that babbling and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people physically more attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to walk around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a roaring loudspeaker, a particularly tiring film.
Some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scalar of long-term vulnerability".
On the scale, statements such as "A lot of things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to become boring than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida – particularly when it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty laid-back bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and doing homework were bored, whereas 23% said they were bored when they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is certain that "youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major influence on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads people to take extreme physical risks and go to gambling or drugs to alleviate them – studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to tell you to do something different,” said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do right now.
If you are bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
But television can cause feelings of happiness in the short term, but these disappear again in the long term.
So if you give your bored child an iPad, it can dissuade him from being bored, but he has not learned how to entertain himself or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, “Self-control transfers from one situation to another.”
The child not only learns to talk, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of them.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even away from the constant activity and technology spraying.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be boring more often, but boredom is the agonizing, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth, people are only looking for a way to shut down and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to keep busy once the noise is silenced."
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
19-year-old community college student and soccer player Anthony Orozco is on trial in southeastern Colorado for an offense that will soon be legal in that state: owning a few marijuana chunks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving a car in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug utensils — cavalry offences, each with a $100 penalty — and was given a court date.
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of lawsuits about marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities will no longer prosecute adults over the age of 21 for possession to a small extent, which will be allowed by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they will continue to prosecute existing marijuana offenses and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the Denver suburbs to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline in mind for 1 December 2013.
In Washington, Colorado is believed to be ahead of most states when it comes to regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is a good place to guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Spirits Supervisory Board.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on December 6 and thus also marks the end point of a gray zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified during this time – for example, how the government’s requirement for “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana should be agreed with the ban on cannabis stores within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his Aurora staff stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses in individuals over the age of 21, and that the police would “as of now” not seek criminal charges for these offenses.
Chief Oates added that police will continue to enforce urban regulations to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers will continue to be persecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck holds a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his agency would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mainly to persuade consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to stand trial for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have also been indicted for other crimes.
“Our agency has a duty to prosecute violations that were criminal at the time of the crime,” Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are ambiguous even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, are no longer reporting adults for possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending ownership proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state revealed a profound disagreement among local officials about the great green experiment.
District prosecutors are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendant in court for marijuana crimes and acts as a spokesperson for the national organization to reform marijuana laws.
“They’ve spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting people for it that they still can’t accept legalization,” he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being traded as national model cases for drug legalization.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue treating the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while criminal officials are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of the drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums for new marijuana stores, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, passed a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this change in the law.
We are determined by what the community has decided on, not by what the state has decided on.
There are still many questions to be asked.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only today’s university students are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my elder brother had attended that university which I once thought was the greatest knowledge stamp in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization—free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College in the late 1980s - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again and caused the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I had left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A.N. Wilson said that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason – one that seemed all the more narrow-minded and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: my now-deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was an advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of moderate right-wing students are suffering similar persecution.
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has grown to such dimensions that a group of them demanded equal protection last week to benefit gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked, and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They are demanding a seat on their college’s equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was exacerbated by a recently aired documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed Tories as an eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It featured, among others, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the University of Oxford Conservative Student Association, who rode a Rolls-Royce and wore a silver-coloured suit and a silver-painted walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered "sin-blocks for introducing higher tuition fees."
20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the University of Nottingham Conservative Students' Association, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing tendency in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, and a history student in Corpus Christi who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is “unpleasant,” and 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of the Oxford Conservative Student Association, says she has witnessed a growing rejection of moderate right-wing students among JCR members.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred for the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to grant Margaret Thatcher – a former student – an honorary degree due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have terrified even Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students got to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of what was going on.
I experienced that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even participated in it with pleasure.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, the privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been prepared for what would come next.
“Miss Wyatt,” said Harry Pitt, “please translate the first paragraph.”
I stumbled upon it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite hateful.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students laughed.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take a few French lessons in your free time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt grumbled to me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That evening, I was sitting in college alone at dinner when someone gently tapped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who envisioned himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory will be harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first-semester students claim to be Labour supporters.
In a local pub I later tried to disguise myself.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A graduate in philosophy, politics, and economics who ironically had attended Eton College, considered conservative, said to me, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" someone asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt the same way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in living a normal life at the University of Oxford?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me stretched before my spiritual eye into a purgatory of disgrace and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who was based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he advised Thatcher on foreign policy and wrote speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for his Marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do that, not in my city of dreaming tower tops.
Even my Communist friends always showed impeccable manners.
His damp eyes darkened.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, where another history tutor had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly shattered by shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a “brainwashing” and called them “old fools.”
The relief only lasted for a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my hammers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're welcome to call me a weeping cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened in London this week, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 Haute Couture dresses created by his "Maison" over the last 50 years have been compiled.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition concludes a story whose sole protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stuffy and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3rd, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, starting with Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the humble fashionmaker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't kick their ticks on your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashionmaker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music recognized and felt his influence.
"All the guests felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" that began her career at the 1995 Paris Haute Couture Week.
“He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual loves.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-meter-long catwalk that suggests a role exchange: the user takes the model's place and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that belonged to Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, who chose "the Emperor's"
In this audience of fashion dolls radiate names such as that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Maker, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," Feria's ex-duchess added.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and fashion leader Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamt of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 90s, it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that honors his name.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino doesn't depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care, because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazzes" (as the fashionmaker called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meters long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society."
For years clouded with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now their best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, cumulates Garavani as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his well-kept and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was immaculate; time leaves no trace on him".
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers risk their lives and health as they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, stony roads.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earned their lives by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in eastern Indonesia’s Java island.
To do this, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulfur-containing gas emerging from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping paths of stone.
While it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent at the turtle pace, keeping the balance and making their steps carefully so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur they mine.
Arriving at the top, they pave the way between the tourists, who photograph them like circus monkeys, and walk with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mining company set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been exploiting the volcano and (never better said) its workers since 1960, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 cents), because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used to produce matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even bleaching sugar.
"Because we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who normally does three routes a day.
For each track it takes three hours, after which it is completely done, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such an almost inhuman effort, however, is three times what he would earn from the field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where at the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees a day, and the work wasn’t that hard, but Anto and his family returned to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason as important as sulfur in Indonesia: “I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam.”
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left the first traces on him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a dragnet.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other wearers and gets up every morning at two o’clock, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guardians of this nature park charge, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
“This work is for animals and not for humans,” protests Madrusin, a strong, 42-year-old supporter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as he can" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even when the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners are trapped in the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so tough that no one complains of serious diseases ... of course except for the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have been deformed by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest, at the age of 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the misery continues generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as human donkeys at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame the lack of children on the career, stress and cost of real estate and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civil duty and create lives!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of a mint candy advertisement, but nonetheless – or precisely because of that – they became a viral video on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
The phrases are part of a rapper song that uses local sayings such as "sliding a bao" (loaf) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
Advertising company BBH, who shot the video, keeps the hope that the commercial will reach out in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is just for the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to reproducing, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it was a topic we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating nights (fast flirting).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don’t we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, like composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Anyone who does not take this issue lightly is the government of Singapore.
Every year, she spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate exceeded 2 – also known as replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to “better education” and “greater career opportunities.”
“This has enabled people to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and priorities besides getting married and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to a higher number of single persons and to the delay of marriage and births, the result of which is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a policy of immigration aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract population reduction has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where hardly concealed xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons the governing party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenue, health care costs, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to make sure that not so many small apartments are being built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Authority for Urban Development has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is a concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they deter construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give developers clearer orientations, which were previously hindered when they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for a rise in the national birth rate, talks with Singaporeans working in the financial quarter show that they will not have a big impact.
"People are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is postponed by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
“For me, it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women cite their careers, the stress and cost of property and upbringing as reasons for not being able to have children.
That’s why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – there’s so much the government can do.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy policy
According to the dictionary, this is the property private or "that area of private life where you are entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to your daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed when he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five teenagers between the ages of 10 and 15, who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to “something very personal” on a personal level and “to the password and the user” when they applied it to the social networks.
“My deepest secrets I wouldn’t reveal in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge while trying to explain the meaning of “private” on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t of me, or of someone who makes the fool,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of nudes, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just uploading them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends," he states.
When asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommends him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to the boy, no one made hints to him or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If anyone is harassing me or demanding them from me, I just remove them from my user account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with experiences that are now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of a friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
“He just did it privately.”
Afterwards, he explains a number of steps to configure a user account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, that's what I'd do if he'd be unsympathetic to me or if I wanted to wipe him out.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and young people, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a medium for searching for information, but with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" shaped these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic "because we require them to have a defined criterion on what may be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is insufficient for that."
“They should also be picky when it’s most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it doesn't work," he says.
There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post a photo of you, like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone need to know what you’re doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to trade online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
“Someone outside the internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is essential that parents read the policies of social networks carefully.
If they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children need to be reminded of the lesson "You shall not speak to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly attempted to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Initially, sources in the state and presidential office told them that they would hand it over after the exit, but later stated that it would be published on the Peruvian government’s website at some point.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to information about the summit was restricted at any time.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting without sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulating among the journalists was obtained from the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document circulating during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the presidential office of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was the Humala statement and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit South America-Arab States (ASPA), and on this occasion too, despite the press' insistent request, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for the journalists were available, but they severely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of The Hague that resolves a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICC, which will begin Monday in The Hague, in the process that Lima initiated against Santiago to listen to the pleadings of both sides.
"We will comply with and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently bringing to this international court," Humala said in a statement.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," added Piñera, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the ICC came after Colombia filed a lawsuit against the Bogotá Agreement after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered a serious mistake, agreeing to submit to the judgments of this international court.
Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner, attended the summit.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after the deposing of its president, Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
Hosting President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, stating that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for a total investment of $17 billion.
Regarding the decisions taken, he said that Unasur countries will “take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the decisions on residence rights.”
He said action was being driven to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organized cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, “economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant steps, but serve to expand our production output and show our peoples a better future,” Humala added.
“We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects that will improve spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms,” the Peruvian president said in a read-only statement.
Among these projects are five Peruvians, located on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are intended to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also made reference to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its resumption into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that he expected on Saturday in Mexico a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, in order to respectfully treat the maritime conflict following a ruling of the ICC challenged by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these paths - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he underlined.
"I hope to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the Block also met in the run-up to the adoption of the 2013 action plan to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru holds the presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn from citizens' integration," Rafael Correa says
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America actually able to learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told Peru’s state television that Europeans “murdered themselves in World War II and other conflicts” and are “practically a homeland today.”
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that pushes the member states of Unasur forward.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, the South Americans always sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he said, alluding to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but had adhered to his “deep democratic values and views on human rights.”
He added that there were “founded suspicions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his proceedings would not be complied with.”
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had demanded that he be interrogated on its territory for an alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law allows this through a videoconference that could have been conducted through the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental state would be compromised.
"Since he has been in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has an easy problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," Ecuador's head of state said.
However, there is a risk that he will suffer physical and psychological damage because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
“This would affect everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution to Assange's asylum granted in the Embassy of Ecuador in London since June was to grant him a free visa to travel to Ecuador, and that it was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and Europe's legal authorities. He underlined that there have been talks with London to find a solution for WikiLeaks' imprisoned founder.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings at various European instances," he said.
And "if Britain grants this license tomorrow, in my opinion, this is done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange on the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the Swedish law permits and has been done in other cases, the problem is resolved.
Correa took the opportunity to affirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press, saying that what he does not tolerate "is the mediocrity, the evil intent, and the lie that defy freedom of expression."
“The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politicians, but bad journalists who are striving for profit and extorting,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "and also not by the bankers or hegemonic and bourgeois countries", and anticipated that if re-elected, he would "deepen the revolution to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the organism "must remain tough and not allow opportunism and no coup d'état disguised as legal" because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, to be "absolutely justified."
This verdict is not currently being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if both countries commit to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
Regarding the possibility of running for the next presidential election in Ecuador to reach his third consecutive term, he stated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 election, he would retire from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under conditions as unjust as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to live up to this responsibility,” he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I would retire from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
“That’s decided,” he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuela’s Vice President, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
“It does not mean a relapse in President Chávez’s health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State attended the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima today, which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of Aids Death Is Too Late Recognition Today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed HIV-positive.
“It was like a bomb hit,” he says about the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor tried to “weaken” without recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such dedication that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmas.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who do not know about their disease and who have already been harmed by the virus and have exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who receives treatment on time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," explained the head of the HCG's HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, stating that this information was supported by a respected scientific publication in April this year.
Infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at initiation of treatment, and that those who do not have a drug addiction have a greater chance of having 50 years of CD4 and up to 30 years of CD.
Simply put, the above statements mean that anyone who is diagnosed with HIV positive at the age of 25, in this sense, "can easily live to be 75 years old as long as he is under control," explained this expert.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Even though mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA annual report), it is true that 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have died since the emergence of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and by the month of May this year there have already been 187 deaths; however, it is assured that universal access to the antiretroviral drugs has been available since 2005.
So why are people still dying from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least over the past 12 years, we have not had any supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that the people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, premature diagnosis is required, which is why massive recognition tests must be offered to all individuals who are required to do so."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private lab, agreed with this proposal, and this for the only reason that it had been a friend of him who had made a complication that was even the kind of cancer in spite of his young age.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and don’t want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was for improvement, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio notes, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are scared today as part of the global AIDS Day.
The sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like everyone else.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara who has taken on the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places designated for this purpose, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; they used to be handed over individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who don't have access to a condom," he said.
Those at risk for new infections include young people.
"Why do you need them?" is a common mockery of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system who do not want to expose themselves, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the counter, but in dispensers in public toilets of facilities that are often visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether conservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like that; the best thing to do is to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th in both new and accumulated AIDS cases, and 13th in terms of HIV.
92% of infections occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for every registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a ruling that does not recognize the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s liabilities achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, a sinister precedent is set for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the land of stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the June 15 recognition of the verdict by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Northern District Court in Texas has led Mexican companies to be vulnerable to seizure of their property across the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to United States bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, headquartered in New Orleans, first says that the main case is the trade bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a cross-border profile is unknown.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created, using the American Law Institute as a conciliator.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without the company’s votes after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass held by Vitro’s branches with its parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies of the group have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Commercial Bankruptcies).
It is also correct that, after the branch’s votes had been deducted, Vitro’s creditors, the creditors who sued Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation from 2008 onwards as part of the major economic crisis in the United States that struck the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family appeals to the same Court of Appeal so that the vote is taken in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare appeal will be filed, demanding the review of the case by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the court set aside a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), describing the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, and pointing out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.
It is also pointed out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the Mexican aviation trade unions' complaints against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, failed to progress for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Aviadores Association) has finally made progress.
The application, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing the judiciary.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the central administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares in the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has achieved to unite the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental establishment that destroyed partially protected areas and is the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government has not complied with a request from the Senate to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as the ACTA abbreviation, the matter has already been filed according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken even though the Senate had disregarded the possibility, considering them a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long-term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings stock exchange certificates of over 500 million pesos to the market.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that promise to pay interest every 28 days.
Establishment of Competitive
Formed from the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is over $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball’s globetrotter, Héctor “Hetin” Reyes, has been associated with basketball for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the country's history of basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a lower-class player, first-national league player, plenipotentiary and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"All my life I put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 90s," Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I was part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as a managing director, co-manager or coach.
It was many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," Reyes says.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying to me, "I have a very strong and 2m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide for another.
The Vaqueros with Gausse championship was granted to him, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his enforcements and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won the pre-Olympic Tournament in Mexico against the US.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, which should have been bronze, if not for this Canadian referee who made us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
My favorite, however, is the 1991 Pan American Games team in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
The team included not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic Tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourrutiner as a substitute for the suspended players due to the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was certainly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculín.
And this without considering his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN up to 17 teams in a season at the beginning of the 90s.
What's left to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, children make unnecessarily many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. on a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked the most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "Ginn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He also acted in two short-lived comedies, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His cinematic works included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly detestable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television chain CBS about the Ewing clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Shot J.R.?", which was supposed to create an expectation for an episode full of emotions where Hagmann's character was nearly killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series set a viewer record at that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had conceived her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she didn’t leave the city, but others had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a devious businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) incarcerated.
"I know what to say on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It was supposed to be "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he hasn’t won.
Victoria Principal, co-actress of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of devotees in the world, and it remains in our hearts for those who have been fortunate to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new issue of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the television channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter has just been filmed, the station informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how Hagmann's loss would be handled in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales About My Life".
“I didn’t write anything that I believed could hurt anyone or affect them in any way,” he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he advocated for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help anxious patients.
"I counsel them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the “long backcounting” of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called “Deudarmaggedon,” as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place Christian theorists believe the apocalypse is beginning.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only professor to offer courses on the “end of the world” this semester, which was supposed to be the last in history.
In Temple, attending Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture, and the End of the World."
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios that lead to a particular human behavior are offered.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed apocalyptic films and looked at how they compare with real life.
"I've been trying to inform students about what's possible, likely, credible, and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course called “The End of the World”.
“We’re not recording 2012 so we always have the option to keep the course going again in case the world doesn’t go down,” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent doom", students must study, create projects, and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is being conducted on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance but to “continue working until the night when the world is supposedly coming to an end,” Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
“In two hours, there were no more seats,” Restall said about his high-average course, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there were still places available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is among the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
The 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing Will Wekesa explains to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a lesson where this is taught,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less a professor - stated that they believed in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that goes back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The internet has increased this speculation.
“People elsewhere don’t think that way,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines is not participating at the end of the world," he wrote in reference to an exception of a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been spoken of the last court, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, “people will immediately think of a new date” or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they want to go to celebrations about “the end of the world.”
"Maybe I'm calling a few friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
