I'm a little crazy.
How about a cup of coffee after lunch?

He looked at me with a tear in an eye.
It's true.
I need you to come home.
I've never seen anyone like Tom before.
She looked him straight into her eyes.
Someone could see us.
How many times did Tom call?

If it snows tomorrow, I'll make a snowman.
I won't marry you.
I'm afraid you'll have to work additional hours.
She turned and smiled.
Manjo was glad.

Among all the countries of the world China has the most people.

I don't think Tomo would.
You went to the stadium?

Every plant needs water and light.
I'll love you until I die.
I'm not about to get into that.

Tom always tells Manny that he loves her.
Why are you always late?
That's exactly what I wanted.
We all longed for you.
The mirror has been romped.
I never fished with Tom.
Tomo thinks this is a mistake.
My daughter likes summer fruits, for example, ceres, watermelons and persiques.
I won't forget that.
Ahh, when are they gonna meet again?
My team is advanced.
It's a new book.

She came from the shop, finding that thieves had taken her bike.
The next day he was found dead in the bedroom.
We always paid off in Germany with travelogues.
I know what you did in Boston.
If you can't enjoy your loneliness, you can't enjoy the together with someone else.

I wish I had changed my room.
Come and see us again.
