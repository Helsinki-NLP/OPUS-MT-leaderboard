Welsh Councillors afraid of "lookin' like a puppet"
His proposal to change his titles to Member of the Welsh Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament [MWP]) sparked concern among some councillors.
This concern arose from the plan to change the legislature's name to the Welsh Parliament.
Councillors in the political spectrum are concerned that this name may be found ridiculous.
One of the Labour Councillors said the party was concerned that the name " rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Gaelic, "twp" is insane, while "pwp" means pooping.
A Plaid Party councillor suggested an alternative, stating that those at the party were generally "not pleased".
One of the Gal Conservative Party Members said that those at his party were "open-minded" about the name change, while MWP said there was a little pun intended for Muppet (pukla).
In this context, the letter "w" in Gaelic is pronounced like the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Parliamentary Commission, which is currently drafting a bill that will bring name changes, said, "The final decision on defining what to call members of the parliament will, of course, be theirs."
By the Welsh Government Act 2017, the Welsh legislature was granted the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission released the results of public opinion on proposals, which received great support for making the legislature's name the Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the titles of councillors, the Commission was in favour of Welsh Members of Parliament (Welsh Parliament Members [WMP]), while the MWP title was the most supported option in public opinion.
The councillors are clearly offering different options, but the consensus may be a headache for the parliamentary president Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill on amendments in the coming weeks.
The law on innovations will include some changes in the way the legislature works, including banning members from parliament and rules such as the order of the committee system.
Members will make final decisions on what name they will take when they discuss the law.
Macedonians to hold referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
This public vote was cast in an effort to end a decades-long dispute with neighbouring country Greece, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that it represents the claim of its neighbour's name on the territory of the north, while it has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the public vote on the name change, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is a price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Covered Silence Like Churches in Harlem Problem
"The old people I talked to say there was a bar and church in every corner in the time," Adams said.
"Now they're both gone."
Adams said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"Now people are socializing in different ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood halls where people regularly go."
As for churches, Adams is concerned that the money obtained by selling goods will not be enough for the leaders as long as they expected, and that they will "come back to where they started sooner or later."
He added that buildings of the kind that would not help the remaining temples of the neighborhood would replace churches.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments from these apartments will be white, so it will accelerate the closure of all churches together, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches," he said.
Both churches were built in Harlem 1870 by the Metropolitan Community, and ten years later by white parishes before becoming the black metropolis St. Martin's.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped nearby took ownership of the building.
Priest John Howard Johnson led the boycott against stores that resisted hiring and promoting blacks on 125th Street, a main street used for shopping in Harlem, taking over a black community led by St. Martin.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's followers ordered a bell team because they planned to rebuild the building.
Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, Father David Johnson, proudly described the bell team as "bells of poor people".
The expert who rang the bells in July gave the team another name: "a cultural treasure" and "an unprecedented historical tool."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also stated that this team was the first bell played by a black musician in the world, which was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell team at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that St. Martin had never replaced him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of whom are non-congregated leaders in the church, and some of whom are found by the diocese district.
The board of directors, the church's executive power of non-religious leaders, sent a message to the diocese in July, worried that the board would "surrender the goods upon them", though it had no part in holding the architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some of the congregation complained that there was no transparency in the church.
In California, the shark injured a 13-year-old boy diving for lobster.
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy diving in California to catch lobsters on the day of the lobster season opening on Saturday, officials say.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. off Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that half an hour after he started diving with his friends on Saturday morning, the boy heard screaming for help and went to him on a boat to get the boy out of the water.
Hammel thought the kid was screaming in the excitement of finding lobster, but then he realized he was yelling, "He bit me! He bit me!"
He told me.
Hammel told me what he saw when he went to the boy: "The entire bone of his brimbone was open."
"I told everyone 'There's a shark in the water' to get out of the water," he added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was determined to be critical.
The type of shark attacking is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles informed the press that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
For 48 hours on research and security grounds, authorities closed the entrance from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami beach in Eginitas.
Giles stated that there were about 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's incorporates Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty departmentaries and specialist staff.
As part of the strong entry into the £2.8 billion cosmetic market as UK's fashion and household goods sales fall, larger cosmetic aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and moved to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in cosmetics comes from supermarkets looking for ways to fill shelves previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's offered Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw said that the number of cosmetic products they have included would be 3000 for the first time.
Brands from L'Oreal to Maybelline and Burt's Bees, such as in brand areas found in stores such as Boots, will find more space.
The supermarket also re-releases the Boutique makeup series so that most of its products will become vegan products that are increasingly in demand by young customers.
Also, Fragrance Shop, a perfume salesman, will be located at two Sainsbury's stores, one of which will be opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the other this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Along with my orientation to shopping online and daily food shopping from small local stores, supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury's General Manager Mike Coupe said sales points would increasingly resemble department stores of the supermarket chain to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount sales stores, which offer more non-food service.
Since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, he has placed Argos stand in hundreds of stores and included some Habitat standings, which he says supports market sales and increases their profits.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate the cosmetics and pharmaceutical department had failed.
Sainsbury's tried to open a joint store with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over sharing the revenues of pharmacies in their supermarket.
After selling Sainsbury's 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago, the new strategy emerged.
Lloyds is said to play a part in the plan by adding luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Sainsbury's Commercial Director Paul Mills-Hicks: "We changed the appearance and feeling of our cosmetic aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in special trained colleagues who are ready to give advice.
Our brand series was designed to meet every need, and our attractive environment and convenient positions mean that we are a cosmetics salesman who forces the old style of shopping," he said.
Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million deal "furious" Peter Jones.
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones left the program "furiously" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal with the lifestyle brand to focus on their new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his home-wearing and accessories brand, Truly.
The two's work had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning's 37-year-old host announced via Instagram that he had left.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, star of Dragons' Den, leaving his lifestyle brand job at the last minute to focus on his new lucrative contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, when TV's golden girl admitted on Tuesday that their new £1.5 million deal at a tense meeting in the centre of the business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire meant that she no longer had enough time to spend on homewear and accessories brands Truly, Jones was "exasperated."
The firm had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and Willoughby was said to have doubled Willoughby's fortune, estimated to be £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, announced via Instagram that he had left Truly, while Jones took his jet to one of his vacation homes outside England.
One source said, "Truly was by far first among Holly's priorities.
He would have a long-term future to support him for the next twenty years.
Holly's decision to withdraw completely shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
Marlow HQ has a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning program host, one of the UK's most box office stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds due to serious investments and potential for release on various products from pillows to candles, clothes to housewear.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby co-founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, including Jones as president in 52, and in March.
The couples are vacationing together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will be M&S' brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin, host of the I'm A Celebrity program on ITV.
"We are not commenting on his business issues," said a source close to Jones last night.
"We fell in love while we were talking"
He made a joke about the criticism that some would receive from the media, as he made comments that he would find "outrageous to the presidency" and was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded by pretending to be a "news anchor":
"I haven't given up on anything."
After Trump described his first call for a meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament, he stated that Kim was interested in a second meeting.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have been disrupted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's leading diplomat, told world leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not seen "responsibility" to previous disarmament moves, from the United States.
Instead, he said, the United States is continuing its sanctions to continue the pressure.
Trump showed a much more optimistic attitude in his rally speech.
"We're great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were going to die.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that developing relations with Kim brought positive results, such as finishing rocket tests, releasing hostages, and returning the rest of the American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to talking to Kim about his relationships.
Trump pointed out the crowd in front of him, saying, "It's very easy to act in a way worthy of the president, but there would be 200 people standing here rather than 10,000 people trying to get into this narrow space."
Tsunami and Earthquake Hit Island in Indonesia, Hundreds of People Die
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population were located, no national disaster reports were reported, the prerequisite for facilitating international assistance.
"Unfortunately, they made it very clear in many cases that they did not seek international assistance, so it is difficult," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children has formed a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether the foreign team will be able to work on the field.
A spokesman for the national disaster agency, Sutopo said Indonesian officers are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to relief work.
Unfortunately, the country is not prepared enough for nature's wrath, given Indonesia has been constantly hit by an earthquake.
While tsunami shelters are being built in Aceh, there are no such studies on other shores.
Although a warning was issued in Palu, it is possible that the absence of tsunami warning sirens caused the loss of life.
Even in the best case, it's hard to travel among many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area affected by the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made developing Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure the most important part of the election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railway roads.
However, financing the deficiencies has made Joko's administration difficult, as reelection will be held next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian conflicts in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority adopts a more conservative belief.
The fighting of Christian and Muslim gangs in the street using knives, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons caused more than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of homes.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a draw goal against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved his team from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, scoring in the 89th minute.
Sturridge took a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as his team was 1–0 behind, 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal.
After slightly taking the ball to his left, he took the shot to the far post.
The shot flew over the penalty area as it headed to the top right of the goal.
The ball finally hit the nets, crashing into the leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com, "I was just trying to get the ball and find a position. Players like Shaq always move as far as they can. I tried to buy as much time as I could."
"I saw Kante coming, and I touched him once, and I took the shot without thinking too much."
Finding the goal in the 25th minute with Belgian star Eden Hazard, Chelsea finished 1–0 in the first half.
The Blues' forward gave Mateo Kovacic a heel pass in the game before running from midfield to Liverpool halffield.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-run in the midfield.
Then he passed a nice break, bringing Hazard to the penalty point.
Hazard passed the defense and, with his left foot, shot past Liverpool player Alisson Becker and threw the ball into the back nets.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the Champions League group match at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in London in the UEFA European League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.
Death toll in Indonesia's tsunami rises to 832
Indonesia's emergency response agency said early Sunday that the number of deaths in the tsunami by the earthquake in the country increased to 832.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's representative, said at a press conference that many people were reported to have been under building debris in the earthquake that struck the country at 7.5 on Friday, causing waves 20 feet high to form.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was flooded with rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation was opened this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of the 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street with stab wounds. A 32-year-old male was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police forces wanted people in the area to show up who had heard or seen anything about the incident.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan, who was investigating the murder, said: "The investigation is in the beginning stage, but I am near John Street in Birkenhead and I call on anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, since they may have crucial information for our investigation, I call for taxi drivers, especially those who may have caught something with vehicle road cams, to contact us."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a native of Birkenhead, who was found inside a private property.
This afternoon, some friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene this morning asking questions about the victim's whereabouts.
Investigations are ongoing as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to break into his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to be found inside or outside the building.
The driver was speechless when he found out what was going on.
The residents are now told it will take hours to be allowed back into their homes.
A police officer was heard telling another man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman with tears appeared at the scene.
She kept repeating, "What's going on is so terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, while another was just outside the cordon.
Several police officers were standing in the cordon watching the apartment buildings.
Anyone with information is asked to write from private to @MerPolCC or call 101 or contact without naming 0800 555 111, the private and secret crime-stop line, quote from 247 of the September 30 journal.
The Cromwell statue in front of the Assembly was the last target monument in the debate on "rewriting history".
The ride of the statue will be divine justice for the fanatical puritan followers of Cromwell, who have destroyed many cultural, religious works in England.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "In the current debate over the removal of the statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace was inevitable to be the target.
Cromwell did not commit the iconbreaking of the British civil wars, nor did these wars take place under his command.
Perhaps a false Cromwell would have been sacrificed instead of Thomas, who was his ancestor from the previous century.
The magnificent Cromwell representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th century view, and Cromwell is a figure that many people still consider worthy of celebration, part of the writing of history.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps much more in the 19th century than it is today, as an advocate of the legislature, in his case, the monarchy.
Whether this is exactly the right statement is an ongoing historical issue of discussion.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century dispute has shaped the development of our nation following this incident, and Cromwell is a well-known figure representing a side of this dispute.
His achievements as Protector Lord are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Murderer Pig Beats Chinese Farmer to Death
According to the local media report, in a shopping mall in southwestern China, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig.
According to the South China Morning Post, the man identified only by his last name, "Yuan", was found near the pigsty in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, covered in blood with his severed artery.
On 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai, China, a pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig pen.
The man reportedly set out with his cousin to sell 15 pigs in the market on Wednesday from the neighboring state of Yunnan.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and realized that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
His cousin said there was a large male pig in the pigsty with blood in his mouth.
The coroner's report confirmed that a giant pig weighed 550 pounds had beaten the farmer to death.
Quoted from Guiyang Main News, his cousin, called "Wu", said: "My cousin's legs were covered in blood, crushed."
Security footage shows Yuan entering the mall Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed him wasn't Yuan's or his cousin's pig.
While police were gathering evidence at the scene, one of the mall managers told Main News that he was being kept closed to prevent the pig from attacking one.
Officials in the mall with Yuan's family are said to have been negotiating compensation for Yuan's death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked the woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
A farmer from Oregon was defeated by his own pigs in 2012, when a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood could be a "trigger".
Farmer: "Pigs are just kidding.
They're curious clamps... they're not after hurting you.
You just need to respect them in the right amount," he said.
What's left of the Rosa hurricane brings widespread rainfall to the southwest of the United States
According to the weather forecast, hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves on colder waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rains that will cause floods across northern Mexico and northwest of the United States.
As of 5 p.m., Rosa was the 1st Category hurricane and wind speed was 85 miles per hour, with the Sunday hurricane located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, on Sunday.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure strip forms along the Pacific Ocean and begins to move east towards the west side of the United States, with Rosa pushing deep tropical moisture northward to the southwest of the United States as it approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday.
On Monday, Rosa will drop rain on parts of Mexico that will reach 10 inches in size.
Subsequently, tropical moisture will interact with the approaching low pressure strip, creating widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Regionally, rainfall from 1 to 4 inches will likely lead to landslides in the desert, in addition to sudden flooding, debris flows.
Deep tropical humidity will bring rainfall rates closer to an hourly size of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation is expected in the southwest regions, especially in much of Arizona, to reach a size of 2 to 4 inches.
Due to the disorganized nature of tropical rain, flash floods are possible with conditions rapidly deteriorating.
On a tropical precipitation warning, it is extremely objectionable to risk going on foot to the desert.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, bores can bring dust which is blown by strong winds in the local area.
The approaching low pressure strip will leave some heavy rainfall in the local area to the Southern California coastline.
A total of over half an inch of precipitation is possible to form, which can lead to slippery roads with small debris flows.
This will be the first time the area has rained.
Some tropical downpours scattered before the rains spread to wider areas by the end of Monday and early Monday will begin to approach Arizona by the end of Sunday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, some temperature emissions can be seen across the United States because tropical belts remain quite warm as the poles cool.
Sometimes this can lead to sudden temperature changes along small distances.
There's a great example of sudden temperature changes across the mid-US on Sunday.
There's a temperature difference of approximately 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, plus there's a difference between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the late summer temperature will rise again and try to spread.
In many parts of the central and eastern United States, along with October, an 80-degree latitude belt is expected to feel a temperature starting from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City can see 80 degrees above normal on Tuesday.
Our long-term climate forecast gives us a high probability of temperatures above average in the first half of October for the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
In his stirring testimony Thursday, the Supreme Court's nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman allegedly accused him of sexual harassment in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, more than 20 million people from six different television networks watched.
Meanwhile, his stand away from politics continued with the broadcasters' regular return of Friday's schedule at the last minute: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford told the U.S. Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh was 100% sure that he had touched himself drunk at a high school party and tried to take off his clothes.
Kavanaugh said he's 100% sure there's no word in his excited testimony.
According to Nielsen's transmission, he said Friday it was possible for more than 20.4 million people to watch the trial.
The company was calculating the average number of spectators based on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel based on MSNBC.
The number of viewers of other networks showing the trial, including the Fox Business Network with the PBS, C-SPAN, was not immediately reached.
Moreover, Nielsen is often having trouble calculating the number of people watching things in the office.
In other words, this number of spectators was of similar size to a qualifying match in American football or the audience of the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose idea servers supported Kavanaugh's appointment, said Nielsen, left all the agbots behind with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's trial.
ABC placed second with 3.26 million spectators.
Nielsen said that CBS watched 3.1 million, NBC watched 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million, CNN watched 2.52 million.
High interest continued after the trial.
On Friday's drama, Flake was the face in the center.
After the moderate Republican office declared that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Kavanaugh caught CBS cameras with CNN that he was booed by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee's trial on Friday morning.
It was broadcast live on CNN, where it stood in front of its head for a few minutes while it was scolded by violence.
A woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think he told the country the truth?
In his form, Kavanaugh was told, "You have power when all these women are powerless."
Flake said his office made a statement before the elevator closed, with more to say at the committee's hearing.
Wired networks and broadcast networks were all on the air hours later, when the Justice Committee directed Kavanaugh's appointment to vote for the entire Senate.
Flake, however, said that the FBI would only do what was said to be committed in the event of a week of investigating the crimes against the island, the time demanded by minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several senators.
Flake's election had an impact because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the number of votes to give Kavanaugh approval without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "politicizing" over Brexit issue
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of plans to leave the European Union of "making political material" Britain's future, damaging national interests.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview right next to May's interview on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign affairs minister Boris Johnson reinforced May's move against May's so-called "demand game" for Brexit, saying May's proposal, which was to collect the tax of Britain and the EU, was "completely absurd".
Wayde Sims' shooting: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson in death of player who played at LSU (Louisiana State University)
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims, who played at LSU.
Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison on charge of second-degree murder.
Officials released video footage of Sims and Simpson facing each other, police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS affiliate WAFB, the police who took the glasses from the scene said that Simpson's DNA sample was found on the glasses.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to fatally shooting Wayde.
The lawyer said the offender's penance was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Interrogator's office issued a preliminary statement Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The department has handed over the rights of the Louisiana State Police fugitive catcher, state police murder lab, South University, and the people of the area, who have assisted the investigation that ended with the arrest.
LSU sports executive Joe Alleva thanked district law enforcement on behalf of their "struggle for justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot 6-inch forward, whose father Wayne also played basketball for LSU, grew up in Baton Rouge.
Last season he averaged 2.6 rebounds with 5.6 points per game.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "shocked" with Wayde's death.
Wade said, "That's what you've always been worried about."
The volcano sprayed ash on Mexico City
Ashes erupting from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern vicinity of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity began in its crater. In 24 hours, 183 gas and ash releases were recorded.
The center followed numerous tremors and thunders.
Footage on social media showed that ash layers covered the windshields of cars in thin layers in neighbouring locations such as Mexico City's Xochimilco.
Geophysicists also identified an increase in mobility in the volcano located 45 miles south of the capital since the earthquake rocked central Mexico with a magnitude of 7.1 in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with separatist Catalans before the anniversary of the independence game
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday. The arrests followed a clash of pro-independence protesters with agile force and also participated in thousands of opposition demonstrations to celebrate the first anniversary of the polarizing game for Catalunya's departure.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the riot forces, which rained eggs at the police and threw dust paints at them, creating clouds of dark dust in the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
The struggles also broke out at the end of the day as police used their baton to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups read songs against Unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain" in the form of "No forgetting, no pardon".
Fourteen people were treated as a result of minor injuries in the protests, local media reported.
The tension also remained high in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters opted to remain independent with an overwhelming majority, but turnout remained low as those opposed to secession boycotted voting.
According to Catalan officials, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent people from going to their polling stations with violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups set up tents Friday to block support demonstrations for one night with the national police.
The show began but had to follow a different course.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful of the possibility of Catalunya gaining independence.
Narcis: "We had one of our best moments last year.
I've seen my parents cry out of joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although last December they were able to win a small but crucial victory, the Catalan separatist parties had difficulty maintaining momentum this year, as many of their best leaders were either in forced exile or were awaiting the hearing for their role in organizing the declaration of independence that followed him by referendum.
Recording the protest against police support on his phone, 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig said the debate was revived by politicians on both sides.
Joan Puig: "The situation has become increasingly tense," she said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who were in prison before the trial, announced he will compete in the European Parliament elections next year.
Oriol said: "Running for elections in Europe is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values, the pressure we see from the Spanish government."
Londonderry: Some men were arrested after a car hit a house
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house located in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent at approximately 7:30 p.m. British summer time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the doors and the building.
At some point, the car could have been fired with a crossbow.
With Menga's shot, Livingston beat the Rangers 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal brings the win to Livingston
Upon reaching the major leagues, Livingston shocked the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard a taste of his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
The difference was Dolly Menga's shot, while Gary Holt's team moved up to second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team still did not win an away win in the Premiership this season, and will face leader Hearts, where he is eight points behind next Sunday.
Before this encounter, the Rangers will host Rapid Wien in the European League match on Thursday.
On the other hand, Livingston played six games for the undefeated streak in the league, and head coach Holt has not met defeat since taking the position from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed positions in front of the dulled guest team
Holt's team gave the Rangers all kinds of problems with his open play and could have taken the lead long before scoring the goal.
Scott Robinson pitched, but his effort was not enough for the goal, then Alan Lithgow's ball went out differently, who slipped to meet Craig Halkett's headbutt.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play in the lead, knowing that they would give the visiting team a difficult time in the standing balls.
That's how the important goal of the game came in.
The Rangers gave the opposing team a free kick, and in Livingston's organization, Declan Gallagher and Robinson threw the ball to Menga, while Menga scored the goal by touching the ball from the middle of the penalty field.
By that stage, the Rangers had more possession of the ball, but the homeowner had a hard time getting past his defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problem,
This game model continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a save.
To Scott Pittman, as Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet were blocked, Lithgow threw the ball out on another Livingston stopping ball.
While all the middles that rained down on the Livingston penalty area were suspended, two penalty claims, Halkett's interference with reserve player Glenn Middleton, and playing with one hand, were denied by the referee.
"Extraordinary" Match by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
An extraordinary performance and result for Livingston.
Each player of the team was excellent and they continued to exceed expectations as a result of their debut.
His playing style and staff have not changed much since his return to the top of the league, but Holt, who has fired the team since his arrival, deserves the greatest of praise.
Holt had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was tremendous, leading a superbly organized defense, while Menga harassed Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far behind their good performance from time to time under Gerrard.
They failed the last ball, only once they were able to pass the opposing defense, and this could be a wake-up call for Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the league.
Welcome to Erdogan both good and bad in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at a breakfast in Berlin, there were smiling faces and a blue sky.
The meeting took place on the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
Two countries had disagreements over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne and inaugurated a new massive mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security to prevent an enthusiastic crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but numerous supporters in the immediate vicinity were present to see the president.
Hundreds of anti- Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accommodate him in the country.
Opposite protests show how a visitor, considered a hero by some Turks living in Germany, has led to a break-up, some viewed by some as dictators.
Car accident in Deptford: Biker dies in collision with car
A bicycle driver was killed in a collision involving an automobile in London.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. British Summer Time at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The car driver stopped and paramedics intervened, but the person died at the scene.
Saturday's accident occurred a few months after another cyclist was hit and run on Childers Street, about a mile from the site.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify the man and inform his family.
The road was blocked, bus routes were changed, and drivers were advised to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured in turmoil
The prison administration said six prison officers were injured in a disturbance in a high-security men's prison.
The confusion came out on Sunday at around 9:30 p.m. British Summer Time in Worcestershire at His Majesty's Prison (Her Majesty's Prison [HMP]) Long Lartin and continues.
Expert "Tornado" officials were brought in to deal with the confusion involving eight prisoners and a wing being stopped.
Officials with minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison workers were assigned to solve the ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
The injuries of six staff have been treated.
We cannot tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are determined that those responsible will be referred to the police and remain behind bars longer."
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the warden was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
In October of last year, rioters were called to the prison to resolve a serious confusion in which officers were attacked by billiard balls.
Flooding Danger in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City for Hurricane Rosa (Could be Useful for Dry Zones)
Arizona is rarely seen hit by a tropical depression, but this is precisely what caused the energy left by Hurricane Rosa earlier in the week to cross the Southwest Desert and create flood risks.
The National Weather Forecasting Agency issued flood warnings Mondays and Tuesdays for the area covering Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as far as West Arizona and South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah.
Rosa is expected to adopt a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching by rain at the end of Monday.
The National Weather Forecasting Agency in Phoenix said in a tweet: "Since 1950, only ten tropical hurricanes, tropical storms, or depression have created a state around Phoenix for 200 miles!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent National Hurricane Center models estimate 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, along with amounts reaching 6 inches on the Arizona Mogollon Edge.
Other parts of the Southwest Desert, including the Middle Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, can receive 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, while in isolated areas this volume can reach 4 inches.
The rains brought by Rosa may be a blessing in areas where there is no risk of flooding as drought dominates the area.
Although the flood is a serious problem, some of these rains may be useful as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
"A little more than 40 percent of Arizona, according to the U.S. Drought Observatory, is experiencing extreme drought problems, at least the second highest category," Weather.com reported.
First of all, Hurricane Rosa's path runs through Mexico's Baja California peninsula to make first contact with land.
On Sunday morning, Rosa, still in hurricane force at 85 miles per hour at maximum wind speed, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is slowing down because it encounters colder waters in the Pacific.
Therefore, it is expected to reach Mexican soil in the tropical storm force Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall, which can be seen in some parts of Mexico, can pose a significant flood risk.
Weather.com reported that "3 to 6 inches of total rainfall is expected between Baja California and Northwest Sonora, it is also possible to reach 10 inches."
Rosa will then follow northern Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning, then entering Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its remains is that Baja California, northwest Sonora and the United States caused a very intense rainfall in the Southeast Desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause floods that could threaten life, mud currents in the deserts, and ground slides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three young children and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found injured with a knife in Somerset.
The young boy was found injured in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area around 04:00 British Summertime on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition was "stable."
Avon and Somerset Police announced that within a short period of time, one was 17 years old, two 18 years old, and the other four men, 20 years old, were arrested in the Redstock area at midnight.
Authorities have appealed to the testimony of anyone who might have a video of the incident on his cell phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh was the Democratic Party's "victim of inferiority and anger".
Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, "A vote to be given to Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the brutal and immeasurable tactics of the Democratic Party."
Trump said Kavanaugh was the Democratic Party's "victim of inferiority and anger" during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and excitedly rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's claim that both of them sexually harassed her when she was young years ago.
Ford also testified at the trial regarding his own claim.
The president told crowd supporters in West Virginia on Saturday: "The American people saw Kavanag's light, quality and courage that day.
A vote that approves Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that will approve one of the most successful legal intelligences of our era, a lawyer with valuable achievements in public service."
Speaking about the importance of Republican turnout to the by-elections, the president indirectly addressed Kavanaugh's candidacy.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running."
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claimed Democrats were taking over the "resistance and obstruction" mission.
The first key vote on procedure for Kavanaugh's candidacy in the Senate is expected on Friday at the latest, one of the senior Republican Party executive aides told CNN.
Hundreds have died in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, the balance sheet is rising
At least 384 people were killed by the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi on Saturday, officials said, and a large number of people hit the beaches.
When waves reached six metres (18 feet) in the city of Palu on Friday, hundreds were gathered for the festival on the beach, and the waves destroyed everything that stood in its way as it led a large number of people to their deaths.
There was a tsunami following a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When yesterday's tsunami threat broke out, people were continuing their activities on the beach, they didn't escape immediately and became victims of the incident," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster harm reduction agency BNPB.
"It wasn't just a tsunami; it dragged cars, trees, houses with it and hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved at 800 km/s (497 km/s) in open sea before reaching the coastline.
He said some people climbed trees and survived to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the Disaster institution showed numerous buildings and shops devastated, bridges bent and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued in the coastal city.
In the area where there were 2.4 million people, earthquakes were felt one after another.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Enforcement Agency (BPPT) announced that the energy generated by the massive tremor on Friday was nearly 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a narrow and long bay, was said to have enlarged the tsunami size.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide-scale" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
He added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing when he said that bodies belonging to some victims were found trapped under the rubble of broken buildings.
Nugroho said that 300 km (190 km) north of Palu, along the coastal area of Donggala, located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, the number of injured and the extent of damage could be greater.
Nugroho stated that communication in Donggala was "completely paralyzed and no information was received".
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers are reaching affected areas.
"Even in this condition, it is a tragedy, but the situation can get much worse," it was said.
Although officials said the waves were coming during the time of the warning, on Saturday, the institution received widespread criticism for its failure to report the tsunami hitting Palu.
In amateur camera footage posted on social media, a man on the upper level of a building can be heard screaming frantically to warn people about the upcoming tsunami on the street below.
In a few minutes, a water wall hits the beach, putting buildings and vehicles in front of it.
Reuters was unable to confirm the camera image immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts as a result of a major power outage that cut communication around Palu.
According to officials, the military has begun sending cargo planes carrying aid from Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has only reopened for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
In Indonesia, the Tsunami Balance exceeded 800.
It's too bad.
According to Mr. Doseba's statement, World Vision's team in Donggala passed the demolition landscapes along the way as they safely reached the city of Palu, and employees remain in tarp tents set up in the garden of their offices.
"They have told us that they have seen many destroyed houses," Doseba said.
It's too bad.
Even if relief groups make a relentless effort to launch disaster relief work, there are some complaints that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise are prevented from going to Palu.
According to regulations in Indonesia, money, supplies and human aid from abroad can only begin to flow if a disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
This ad hasn't been made yet.
"This is still a regional-level disaster," said Indonesian Red Cross spokesman, Aulia Arriani.
"We can be open to international assistance after the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," but there is no such status yet."
Following Friday's earthquake and tsunami, on the second night in Palu, families and relatives of missing persons still hope that their loved ones may be miracles that disrupt the unpleasant stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was removed from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers dug up a woman who had been trapped under a pile of stones caused by the flood for two days, along with her mother's body.
Indonesian paragliding national team coach Gendon Subandono was running two of the missing slope paratroopers for the Asian Games, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
According to Mr. Mandagi, the rest of the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a veteran in the slope parachute field, I am suffering my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon described how news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel ran amongst the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu contestants attending the beach festival.
However, his messages remained a grey sign of approval rather than a double blue sign of approval.
"I think that means the messages aren't transmitting," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 U.S. during the ATM loading process at Newport on the Levee.
Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who filled the ATM at Newport on the Levee, the Newport Police Department reported.
In the news, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver was preparing to empty the ATM at the entertainment facility and load more money.
While the attendant was busy, another man stole the bag full of money to be loaded into the ATM "run after the Blink employee".
According to the report, witnesses said there were multiple suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Those who have information on their identities need to contact Newport police on phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapist, changing his name to Ye
Rapist Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced this change on Saturday on Twitter: "The person officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had been using the Ye malave for some time and named it after his eighth album, released in June.
The change was made before appearing on Saturday Night Live, which was expected to promote his new album Yandhi.
According to the program producer, he'll be filling in for Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons."
West had said that this word was not only short for the current professional name, but also important to him in a religious sense.
West had spoken to the radio host Big Boy earlier this year about the title of his album, saying, "I think 'ye' means 'you' in the Bible,' the most used word to the Bible."
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The only thing that means is that our better, worse, confusion has become Ye, a reflection of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's just one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs had various aliases such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, also uses his name hyphenated or hyphenated and capitalized or lowercase.
Mexican AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, swore that the country would never use military force against civilians at the time of its nearing the 50th anniversary of the bloody act of retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never take advantage of military power to keep the people of Mexico under pressure".
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people at a time when left student movements took root in South America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly aid to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drew young people into criminal gangs.
The United States must double artificial intelligence funding
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence practitioner who had previously worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this area, as China has increasingly increased its effectiveness in artificial intelligence.
After announcements of artificial intelligence from various public institutions of the United States were made, comments came that the United States did not even have an official artificial intelligence strategy in general.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
"When all other countries are far behind the United States and we are looking for the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence, it would be a good start to double the AI research budget," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that double funding would double the possibility of the next major AI success in the United States.
"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Artificial Intelligence Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) is the CEO of the Sinovation Ventures company Lee, one of the most important artificial intelligence companies in China, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.
In the 1980s, Carnegie worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first-ranked American Othello (Reversi) player at Mellon University, and later headed the Microsoft Research institution and Google's Chinese branch.
Lee commemorated technology competitions previously carried out by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robot Struggle, and asked when the next competition would be held to help determine the next visionary.
Lee said it usually takes a lot of work to get state support in the United States.
"Academic leaders are not China, but companies are getting it," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring intellectuals from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. study of artificial intelligence.
"I think people who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should be automatically given a green card," he said.
The Chinese Advisory released the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that the Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provided funding for employees at academic institutions as the National Science Foundation and other public institutions distributed to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center aimed at the participation of partners from the sector and academy, and the White House announced the formation of the Selected Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a 2 billion USD investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing 100 million USD annually in artificial intelligence research.
On the other hand, there has been no action for months on U.S. legislation that seeks the creation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote whether the country's name will be changed in referendum
Macedonia's people voted Sunday's referendum whether to change its name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia" as a move to resolve the years-long dispute with Greece, which blocked European Union and NATO membership applications.
Greece, a region called Macedonia, argues its northern neighbour's name means a claim on Greece's territory and vetoes NATO and EU membership.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the new amendment would damage the ethnic identity of Macedonian Slavs, which constitutes the majority of the population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has caused doubt as to whether the 50 per cent turnout required for the referendum to be valid will be achieved.
The question on the referendum ballot reads: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, the price is worth paying at the expense of admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, which represents safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it has no legal binding, an adequate number of members of parliament said they would comply with the vote to finalise the decision.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no rulelessness was reported until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout remained only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko changed the country's name in the Macedonian referendum and voted to pave the way for NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and removing seats in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have honor.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to other options like China and Russia and join Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are pro-EU and NATO, a large majority will vote positively," Zaev said after using the vote.
He said the "yes" result would be "to ensure our future".
Last Monday, a poll by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies suggested that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters (under the required turnout) would participate in the referendum.
In another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV channel, 57 per cent of respondents said they plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said you'd say yes.
In order for the referendum to succeed, turnout must reach 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first serious blow the pro-Western government has taken to its policy since it took office in May of last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero scores past all Brighton defenses
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling disbanded the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2–0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero was able to make his 65th minute goal appear comically easy.
The Argentine goaltender received a pass in midfield at the start of the series.
After running through three Brighton defenders, he reached the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
First he went after a defender, then he left a few more at the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he sent a pass to his left and found Sterling.
The British striker made his first touch on the penalty field, returning the ball to Aguero, with Aguero with his right foot, hitting the right side of the wicket, hunting Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked to him about playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at that moment."
However, Sterling was the first to give the Sky Blues the advantage in the Premier League challenge.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero met with the ball on the Brighton field in that game.
He threw a nice ball at Leroy Sane from the left flank.
Sane made several touches before leading Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues' forward sent the ball to the nets before slipping off the field.
City will be competing with Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 p.m.
Scherzer plans to break the game against the Rockies
With the Nationals saying goodbye to qualifying, there is not much left to force a new start.
But Scherzer, always a competitive figure, hopes to sweep the field against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, if he still has a playoff chance for the Rockies, who have one more win than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West NL.
The Rockies at least consolidated their right to participate with a 5–2 win over the Nationals, but are still trying to win the major league title.
"Even if we have no purpose, we can do our best here with the crowded atmosphere in Denver, knowing that the rival team will play at the highest level I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in this rivalry?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but in such a case they are reportedly able to let Scherzer make the shot.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, had a warm-up practice on Thursday and will pitch in his regular spot on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed player has an average of 18-7 this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts during 220 2/3 innings.
Trump rallied in West Virginia
Speaking to the by-elections about the importance of Republican turnout, the president indirectly addressed the situation experienced by Supreme Court candidate Kavanaugh.
"Everything we do is in danger in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's very, very big. I'm not running, but I'm actually running; that's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
"You see this horrible radical Democratic group, you see what's happening now.
They are determined to regain power by every means necessary, you see their cruelty, their abomination.
They don't care who they hurt to take power and control, who they step on, and that's why they want power and control, but we're not going to give it to them."
He said the Democrats adopted the "resistance and obstruction" mission.
"You see this for the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "furious and cruel, disgusting and lying".
High booing from the crowd rose when he named the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, the highest ranking judge of the Senate Magistrates Committee.
"Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Ah, ah, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one, the body language was terrible, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Business Party is no longer a free platform of thought.
There is no tolerance for those who speak their opinions.
I'm not surprised when the Momentum activists at my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I'm the last one among Labour parliamentarians to be told we're not well received for saying our ideas.
My parliamentary friend Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she displayed a decisive stance against anti-Semiticism.
In my case, the censorship motion was critical of me for having a disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
A responsible economic policy, issues such as national security, the importance of Europe, similar issues in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting stated, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
That was exactly what the GC meetings were like on Friday night for most of the eight years I spent as a local parliamentary officer of the Labour Party.
Unfortunately today, it is not the style of many meetings, and even if it existed before, the promise of "kinder" policy has long been forgotten.
It became increasingly clear in the Labour Party that different views were not tolerated and that each idea was judged by the party's administration as to whether it would be accepted.
This came out soon after Jeremy became a leader. My friends, whom I had previously thought had similar political views, asked me to make a U-turn on issues such as national security or the EU common market, and to take a stance that I would never accept.
Every time I speak publicly (it doesn't really matter what I say), I find a series of insults calling for debugging on social media, condemning the policies of the center, and saying I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
I know I'm luckier than some of my friends because the comments directed at me are usually political.
Every day I respect and admire the professionalism and determination of these friends who face a flood of sexist or racist insults and never withdraw themselves.
One of the saddest aspects of this political era is how insult levels are normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn suggested last week that Labour should feed a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer that platform of free thought, and the party is narrowing down with every "insecurity" motion or amendment of election rules.
I've had a lot of advice in the last two years that I shouldn't get involved in meat and milk and keep my mouth shut and then "everything's gonna be fine."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student in action with the neglect of the Thatcher government that caused my comprehensive school class to fail, I have worked to offer better public services to those who need it most as a local councillor or minister.
I never hid my policies, including the last election.
In Nottingham East, no one has ever been confused about my political stance and the areas in which I disagreed with the current administration.
All I'm going to say to those who support Friday's motion is that I cannot understand the desire to spend so much time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's administration as the country is barely moving towards a Brexit that will harm home economies, businesses and our public services.
But the message I really want to give is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents who are and are not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of debugging or political interest can prevent me from doing what I believe you all serve in the best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Separation settled first
Two attempts in the last minutes may have slightly changed the final result, but Ayr was definitely the one who deserved the victory in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the league and the only team out of ten teams without defeat.
In the end, the host team and coach Peter Murchie, thanks to their excellent defenses as well as their better use of the luck that comes, are very right to be pleased.
"So far we have tested our games and we are still unbeaten, so I am happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Congratulations on the separation, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's essay, translated by Frazier Climo in the 14th minute, put Ayr ahead, but with the yellow card seen by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' game was released, so Melrose made the figures speak, and Jason Baggot caught an untranslated try.
Climo led Ayr 17–5 to the break, making the home run as they entered halftime after putting Ayr ahead with a penalty.
However, Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt translated by Baggot reduced the difference to five points.
It was then a long pause during Ruaridh Knott's serious injury and off the field with a stretcher, and when the match restarted, Ayr opened the difference with a Stafford McDowall attempt translated by Climo.
Ayr's captain in the game, Blair Macpherson, saw a yellow card, and Melrose again used his overman advantage with an untranslated Bruce Colvine attempt at the end of a harsh edition.
However, the home team came back as a result of Struan Hutchinson seeing a yellow card due to his interference with Climo in the ballless field and riveting the win with MacPherson's touch from the penalty line.
Kyle Rowe picked up the ball after David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth try, followed by Climo, once again, making the conversion shot from the almost restart line.
Still Game star seems to be stepping into a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game's star, Ford Kieran, is preparing to enter the food industry, who turns out to be the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series he wrote and played with long-running comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next ninth season would be the final season of the show, apparently Kiernan began planning how to move on after Craiglang ended.
According to official records, the actor appears to be the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The player refused to comment on the issue, but a source reached by the Scottish Sun implied that Kiernan was planning to be thrown into Glasgow's "growing restaurant industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no shore to the sea, hopes the court will open a path again to reach the Pacific
The Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz, equipped with crests.
An ocean blue flag is flying in public buildings.
All naval bases from Lake Titikaka to Amazon are covered by the slogan: "We have a right to the sea.
To heal, it is our duty to take this right."
The memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody spring struggle in the 19th century continues to live in the memory of the Bolivian people who have no seashore, and once again the desire to sail into the Pacific Ocean has not been extinguished.
Nowadays, Bolivia's hopes have increased perhaps more than ever in recent years, with the country awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which will be held on October 1st after five years of negotiations.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said of the issue, "Bolivia is waiting for the result, full of energy, unity and unity, and calmness and, of course, from a positive point of view."
Many Bolivians across the country have been monitoring the ICJ's decision from large screens. After decades of irregular talks, Bolivia had appealed to the ICJ, stating Chile is required to negotiate on giving Bolivia an independent piece of land for transport to the sea. The Bolivian people are hopeful that the court in The Hague will accept Bolivia's request.
Bolivia's domestic charismatic leader, Evo Morales, also relied on the decision to be made on Monday. Morales faces a contentious challenge for next year's re-election.
Morales promised at the end of August that "we are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
However, some analysts state that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favor and that even if it decides in its favor, there will be no serious change.
The UN agency in the Netherlands does not have the authority to give Chilean territory to Bolivia, and also said that the institution will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
According to Chilean international legal expert Paz Zárate, the fact that the ICJ reached a decision only six months after the final defences were made suggests that the case was "not complicated".
Moreover, talks over the past four years may have been more against Bolivia than to support its motives.
"The issue of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
According to Zárate, Morales' aggressive rhetoric also exhausted Chileans' last sense of goodwill about the issue.
Bolivia and Chile will sit down again at a certain point, but it will be difficult to carry out negotiations from now on.
Neither country has sent messengers to each other since 1962.
Former president and Bolivia's representative at The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, denied allegations that the court had taken the decision at an unusual speed.
Veltzé said in a statement that Monday would offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in their relationship with Chile" and that it was a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements by benefiting both sides".
Calzadilla also denied the claim that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue for his political gain.
According to Morales, "Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean."
"This decision is an opportunity to resolve past issues."
North Korea will not release nuclear weapons until it trusts the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has announced that they will never give up nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Ri gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfil promises made at the summit in Singapore between leaders of the two countries.
Ri's statements came three months after talks with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hinted that he was on the verge of restarting the deadlocked nuclear diplomacy talks.
Ri called the idea that ongoing sanctions and the U.S. opposition to the declaration to end the Korean War would only bring North Korea to its knees as a "empty dream".
Until Pyongyang takes the important disarmament steps, Washington is wary of signing the declaration.
Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up nuclear weapons, which he sees as the only way to secure security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Soon, the newest huge collections of hats you'll see in store displays appeared at Paris Fashion Week.
If you want to add bigger hats to your collection or block the sun completely, it's easy to find the right hats for you now.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne brought incredible-sized types of accessories to the podium for the 2019 Spring/Summer collection, which also fascinated the names that set style trends at Paris Fashion Week.
The hats, which were not very useful this summer, had ravaged the Instagram, and the designers of these hats took their dazzling designs to the podium.
One of Valentino's prominent designs was a large-edged beige hat decorated with feather-like details, wrapping the entire head of the model.
Other large-length accessories include watermelons decorated with gemstones, a wizard's hat, even a pineapple, but of course these accessories are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne presented another collection of strange masks, which was very appropriate for the spirit of the upcoming Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had the mouth covered with stitches, and the masks resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture designs.
One of the designs was similar to a fully tubed diving equipment with snorkels and sea glasses, while another reminiscent of a melted ice cream cone.
You're lucky if you're following giant fashion trends.
Style experts say these huge hats could soon be in store displays.
The big hats quickly trended along with the collection "La Bomba", which we saw in everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski with very wide-edged straw hats.
This brand behind the disused hat fashion spread on social media presented a larger design in her fashion show: the mat beach bag she carried appeared on a model podium with a bathing suit almost as big as herself.
The prominent design of the La Riviera 2019 Spring/Summer collection, which Jacquemus had put on sight at Paris Fashion Week, was a bag for a dark orange shelf decorated with shelfia tassels and completed with a white leather bag handle.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL about these designs: "I expect big hats and beach bags to be replaced in store displays next summer. The designer has made such a big impact that it will be very difficult to deny demand for large-length accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are of great importance to the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have an academically successful history, and in 2018 this success was maintained with outstanding test results supported by sports, art, music and other civil society studies.
These schools, with over 30,000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Board of Independent Schools (The Scottish Council of Independent Schools [SCIS]), work to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their subsequent education and higher education, the career they have chosen, and to become world citizens.
As educational institutions that can prepare a special curriculum for students and implement this curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and necessary lesson in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak from the language he understands with someone,
If you speak your native language, you speak your heart."
If we want to connect with people from other countries and establish mutual trust, it is a powerful reminder that we should not rely solely on English.
Based on this year's final exam results, we can see that language classes in independent schools are at the top of the scoreboards with the highest passing grade rates.
This year, a total of 68% of students taking foreign language classes passed their courses with a high grade of A.
According to data collected from the 74 member schools of SCIS, 72 per cent of students who took Chinese classes, 72 per cent of those who received German, 69 per cent of those who received French, and 63 per cent of those who received Spanish passed their classes with an A.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language courses as basic skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Language classes, which are elective courses, are now considered equivalent to FeTEMM (Fen Sciences, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and other schools.
In 2014, a study conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of the reasons employers have suffered from suffering while taking new staff to vacant positions were associated with a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills become even more compulsory in preparing young people for their future careers.
These skills have been fundamental skills in the globalized world, as more employers require language to speak for possible jobs.
If the person knows a second language independently of the career he has chosen, he will have a real advantage in the future, as he has this skill he can use for life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from outside countries automatically puts more than one language person ahead in competition.
According to a 2013 poll conducted by YouGov, 75% of the more than 4,000 people living in the United Kingdom do not speak enough foreign languages to chat, and other than French (15%) in no foreign language, the rate of speakers does not reach a two-digit number.
Therefore, investing in language education today is of great importance to future children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will increase children’s chances of finding a suitable and reasonable job in the future.
Languages taught in schools in Scotland vary.
While certain schools offer more traditional modern language options, some schools, such as Chinese or Japanese, teach languages thought to be important to the United Kingdom in 2020.
Your child may choose one of the various foreign language options taught by specialised teachers in independent schools, regardless of what area he is interested in.
Scottish independent schools aim to provide a teaching environment that will prepare children for the future and equip them with the skills necessary for success.
It is an unmistakable fact that in today's global business environment, foreign languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, which must be reflected in the real life of education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity, and success to the youth of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Board of Independent Schools of Scotland.
LeBron will wear his Lakers jersey for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his Los Angeles Lakers debut will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would also be on the field in a preseason opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it is not clear how many minutes he will play.
Walton stated on the Lakers official website that "this time will be more than a minute, less than 48 minutes."
According to a tweet by Lakers reporter Mike Trudell, James will likely remain on the field for a limited time.
Following this week's practice, James was asked about the Lakers' plans for the six-game preseason program.
"I don't need preseason games to prepare for this stage of my career," James said.
The Time of Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting his busy rally show tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This rally will be the first of the five rallies Trump will hold next week, with break points on the schedule that will welcome Trump as friendly as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump's approval vote for the U.S. Supreme Court's vacant member squad has been suspended. Trump aims to gain public support in the upcoming by-election for the Republican Party, who is at risk of losing their superiority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how can you watch the rally online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled to take place tonight, on Saturday 29 September 2018, at 7:00 Eastern (US and Canada) time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live from the YouTube channel below.
Trump will most likely address this week's hearing on Brett Kavanaugh, whom he nominated for a Supreme Court membership, with allegations of sexual assault and the expected vote of approval in the Senate being suspended for up to a week during the FBI investigation causing the session to be tense.
However, the main goal of this intense rally program is to help the Republican Party gain momentum, facing the risk of defeat in the November election.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign spokesmans said that the aim of the five rallies to be held next week was to "move volunteers and supporters to preserve and expand the superiority the Republican Party has in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"The control of Congress is so important to the president's agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible during the busy campaign period," a spokesperson for the Trump campaign told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the rally scheduled to be held tonight at Wheeling Wesbanco Arena "could attract supporters in Ohio and Pennsylvania states and be in the Pittsburgh media."
Trump will have visited the province twice in the past month, with a rally on Saturday, with the president of the United States winning the 2016 election by a greater margin than forty percent.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate, who is left behind in the Republican Party's polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and support Morrisey in the polls," Reuters quoted political scientist Simon Hader of the University of West Virginia as saying.
Ryder Cup 2018: As the US team approaches single games to be held on Sunday, the US team remains determined to fight to keep their hopes alive
After three one-sided games, the four-way (foursome) matches that took place Saturday afternoon added vigor to the Ryder Cup.
The constant transition of momentum from one team to another throughout the competition is a purely made-up concept of sports, but athletes believe in it from the heart, especially in such matches.
And who do the players think has the momentum right now?
"They started six points ahead at the end of the day, and that difference is now down to four, so I can say we've gained a little momentum," Jordan Spieth said as he finished the day.
Of course, the European team, which was four points ahead and could win twelve more points in the match, finished the day with an advantage.
According to Spieth, Americans feel they are taking the wind behind them, and many factors encourage Americans, especially Spieth and Justin Thomas, who play together during the day, are in shape and both scoring three points out of four holes.
Spieth set an example for everyone, performing perfectly from the starting point to the ending point.
Throughout Spieth's round, the cries of victory from the throat grew stronger and stronger, with Spieth taking the putting hit, which was of great importance to tie the score up after losing points in both holes with Thomas.
The putting kick in the 15th hole, which won the game to the American team, again brought similar screams of joy, which showed Spieth believed the American team was continuing the fight.
"You have to push yourself and only think about your own performance," Spieth said.
Right now, all the players need to think about it.
There are 18 holes left where they can make a difference.
In the past two days, the only two to score more points than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup's two most undisputed players.
Europe's different but lovable duo earned points in all four of the four holes and made no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only two that did not bat a bogey on Saturday afternoon, and they also avoided bogey hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning at the last nine back grandmas.
This performance and their energy move enthusiastically into the crowd, and the power they receive from the crowd in return supports the idea that they will win on Sunday, likely as the day ends at Le Golf National, Fleetwood or Molinari will be the most popular players to finalise a potential European victory.
Preferably both are expected to bring this victory in different holes at the same time.
But it's too early to talk about the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's fourball games, and Alex Noren in a match.
A bogey and two double bogey tackles in the first nine pits led the Spanish and Swedish player to stay on a poor score they did not survive until the end of the game.
But on Sunday, no one can help change the bad score.
Seeing the interaction between couples, the advice they give each other or hide from each other, and seeing that strategy can change instantly.
Europe has performed better as a team so far, and entered the final day by a serious margin, however these four matches showed that the U.S. team, particularly, did not lose the fight determination, and doubts on the U.S. side would have gone away.
European Ryder Cup's final day leads 10-6
On Saturday, the European team finished 10–6 against the four-way (foursome) team, entering the Ryder Cup's final day with a major advantage.
The exciting duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charts by winning two victories over Tiger Woods to draw their score to four points at Le Golf National so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, aiming to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, won victory over the American team who failed to hit the target in the morning's football match, winning the series 3–1.
The U.S. partner took two matches, showing more resistance in the tournament, but failed to melt the difference.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie player to score four points in a row, while Molinari named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, and he was the second couple in Ryder Cup history to win four points in four games at the opening.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in team games, they were perfectly prepared to defeat faint Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a much more effective 5&4.
Dragging himself through two games on Saturday, Woods showed occasional bursts of excellence, but for now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and a four-game tournament, and has a seven-game losing streak.
Rested for the four ball games in the morning, Justin Rose merged with his partner Henrik Stenson against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively, the world's first and third, and a 2&1 defeat.
Yet Europe, on a pleasant and airy day in southern Paris, did not manage things the way it wanted.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the criteria for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
After winning a tough 2&1 in a four-ball against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, Poulter and Rory McIlroy lost the first two holes in a four-way game, but lost 4&3.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history does a team go four points behind to the singles, but as a trophy holder, Furyk wins a tie to keep the trophy.
However, after being second best for two days, a counter-attack seems to be far beyond their powers on Sunday.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament is "in no way possible" without confidence
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the embargos that continue in the country had deepened distrust of the United States, under which circumstances the country could never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the world establishment's annual General Assembly that North Korea took "significant goodwill measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests last year, removing the nuclear test site, and promising that it would not produce nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Even so, we are not getting the reward from the United States," he added.
"He will not be able to have faith in our own national security without any confidence in the United States, and under these circumstances there will be no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Ri re-expresses familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance against a "remarkable" approach in which North Korea will be rewarded for taking gradual steps, while his statements seem important because he unilaterally did not reject the removal of nuclear weapons as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to joint statements by Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un at the summit between the incumbent president of the United States and a North Korean leader at which Trump promised to work on June 12th in Singapore to "free the Korean peninsula from nuclear."
North Korea is looking for ways to officially end the 1950–1953 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington was also resisting calls to loosen difficult international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States first insists on 'resolvement from nuclear' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to carry out its objectives in compelling ways. In fact, it opposes being 'reported that the war is over'," Ri said.
"The perception that productions can make us kneel is the empty dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that ongoing sanctions reinforce our insecurity."
Ri made no mention of a second summit plan to take place between US leader Trump and Kim, highlighted earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, he emphasized and added three talks between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months: "If this matter of nuclear cleansing had been about South Korea and not the United States, the problem of nuclear decontamination of the Korean peninsula would not have been blind node in this way."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from last year's speech at the UN General Assembly when "Mr. Satan President" Trump said that North Korea's rockets were inevitable to target the U.S. mainland after Kim called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for having the courage to take steps towards disarmament at the United Nations this year, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must continue until North Korea is free of nuclear.
"It doesn't matter if this takes two years, three years or five months," Trump said Wednesday, saying there is no time frame for it.
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue with violence and without any failure until full, precise and verified nuclear purification is carried out."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri during the UN General Assembly, then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not good.
Hours after leaving Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, North Korea had condemned him by saying that he had suggested "mafiavarial demands".
North Korea has pledged to dismantle a missile field and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "reciprocal measures" at a meeting with Moon this month.
Moon said that the "reciprocal measures" that Kim was looking for him were Trump's security guarantees in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking enough rest classes.
A new class at Harvard University this year leads all its students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of 'all nighters' who study through caffeine.
An academic found that when it came to taking care of themselves, students of the world's number one university were unaware of even the most basic information.
In the United States, Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep treatment at Harvard Medical School and expert on Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course he believed to be the first of his kind.
He received the lesson's inspiration from a speech about the impact of sleep deprivation on his learning ability.
Professor The Telegraph said, "At the end of the conversation, a female student came to me and said, 'Why is all this being said to me now, when I was senior?"
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said.
This is the first time this year's lesson explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and also improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of health care at the university, said the university decided to open the class after realizing that students had been seriously sleepless during the week.
An hour's course involves a series of interactive tasks.
One chapter includes a dorm room picture where students click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books, listening to how the effects of coffee and light affect the lack of sleep of athletic performance, as well as listening to what they will be told about the importance of regular sleep.
In another episode, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map containing interactive landmarks then encourages participants to consider their own daily routines.
"We know students don't change their behavior instantly.
However, if you have the right to know how it affects your health, we believe they have the same right to know," added Prof. Czeisler.
Adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students — sleep deprivation — is a growing problem, he said — there is still a culture of pride in "working all night."
Sleep enough and ensure that sleep is of good quality, must be the "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, even to avoid gaining too much weight, because sleep deprivation makes the students feel hungry all the time while putting the brain into hunger mode.
Raymond So, 19, a California student of chemical and physical biology, took a lecture from Professor Czeisler in his first year of school last year, helped Professor Czeisler design the course.
He said the lecture opened his eyes and inspired him to create campus-wide awareness.
In the next step, he hopes to ask his undergraduate students to complete a similar lesson before joining competitive institutions.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm on the time when they will wake up, as they will, and also warn them of the harmful effects of the "blue light", which causes daily rhythm from electronic screens and LED lights, causing them to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes out Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's hit takes Steven Gerrard's disorganized team to a 1–0 loss at Livingston, while Rangers suffer another away upset.
The Ibrox team were trying to win their first away win since the 4–1 St Johnstone win in February, but Gary Holt's team scored eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts, exposing Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and low morale Rangers eleven never seemed to come to their senses.
Now as the Rangers fell to sixth place, Livingston rose to third place, just one goal behind Hibernian.
Further problems seem to be on the way for the Rangers after the foreign substance, which was clearly thrown from the far end, hit by side referee Calum Spence and the injury to the referee's head was treated.
Gerrard switched eight players on his team, removing Ayr from eleven of the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt did not make any changes to the Livingston 11 who scored a point from Hearts last week, and he could be happy that his solid team did not breathe to his opponent at every turn.
Although the Rangers dominated his opponent in the possession of the ball, Livingston did more work with the ball they had.
Menga's first short pass was that they should have found the goal within the second minute when Scott Pittman sent it towards Allan McGregor's wicket, but the midfielder missed this big chance by a big margin.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free kick later found captain Craig Halkett, but teammate linebacker Alan Lithgow hit the back post with the ball out.
Although the Rangers took control, there seemed to be more hope in their game than faith in the last thirty minutes.
When he collided with Steven Lawless as he entered the final fifteen minutes of the game, Alfredo Morelos believed they had certainly achieved a penalty, but referee Steven Thomson did not heed the Colombian's objections.
The Rangers managed to send only two of their shots to the wicket in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly Lassana had no trouble taking out the head kick of Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria's calm kick.
Although Livingston's game in the first 34 minutes has spoiled the game, no one can deny that they won the win by their hard work.
Again, the Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' deepball.
Declan Gallagher sent the ball towards Scott Robinson, who would send it to Menga for an easy finish, while Scott Arfield made no move.
Gerrard took out Ryan Kent at halftime, replacing him with Coulibaly, though the change immediately showed its effect when the winger sent the ball to Morelos, but effective goalkeeper Kelly jumped out of his wicket, blocking the ball.
However, Livingston continued to draw his guests into the game, which Lithgow and Halkett enjoyed playing with consecutive long balls.
Holt's team could have raised the difference in the final stages of the game, but McGregor stood up to block Jacobs before Lithgow hit a wide header from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton wanted a penalty for his team again after he collided with Jacobs towards the end of the game, but referee Thomson again ignored the request.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger Sayer
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years before today, and the day future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would eventually bring with it the device known as the Geiger Counter.
Geiger Sayaci, one of the indispensables of science since that day, was one of the indispensables of pop culture, as was the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who did not appear to be likely.
Man: "What in God's name is this?"
Rogers: "This is used to find radioactive substances such as a Geiger counter, uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms distributed by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Really, now they're definitely exploding!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention of his name remains.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and kill malicious cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from patients and differentiating them in the lab.
These cells are able to "see" the protein that is common in many cancer cells and are reinjected.
The test vaccine presents promising results in patients with varying levels of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw uterine cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking the immune cell from the patients, differentiating it in the lab, allowing them to "see" the protein Her2 found in many cancer cells, and reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
Her2, including breast, uterus, lung and colon cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky, "it causes cancer to grow in many types."
An approach similar to "teaching" how to take immune cells from patients and target cancer cells has worked in treating a form of leukemia.
Kanye West Joined the Trump Supporter Debates After Coming Out of SNL in a MAGA Hat.
It didn't go well for him.
Kanye was booed in the studio during West Saturday Night Live after his incoherent speeches that he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and also said he would sit in the presidential office in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great hat, he rant about Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I've talked to a white man many times and they said to me, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I had concerns about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL started the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony against Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment charges against the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Although unpublished, footage of West's speeches were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by uploading the video.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time backstage due to the hat he was wearing.
"They bullied me behind the scenes.
"Don't go on stage with that hat," they said.
They bullied me!
Then they say I'm in a sunken place," according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Would you like to see a sinkhole?" And he said, "I'm going to pass my superman cape, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
According to Variety, West's comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and SNL caste players seemed embarrassed, one person from around saying to the press: "The whole studio is buried in dead silence."
West had been called at the last minute instead of the singer Ariana Grande, who was unable to attend the show when her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West had surprised many with his song I Love dog, disguised as a Perrier Bottle.
West received support from TPUSA president Candace Turner, a conservative group, with a tweet: "Thank you for standing up to one of the bravest souls."
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "no one but him and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by "supporting" his art), which I think he has embraced and distributed the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
So are we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now the "officially known entity as Kanye West".
It is not the first artist West to change his name and follow Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg changed his name to Snoop Lion, of course the passing music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and became the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington criticized toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his warrior Jon Snow character in the fantastic Middle Ages series Game of Thrones, which includes HBO's violent scenes.
But the 31-year-old actor gave harsh criticism about the macho hero stereotype, the famous actor stating that the prominence of such roles on the screen often led young men to feel compelled to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Cultural crop, Kit stated that he felt that "some things didn't work out" and questioned how to fight his toxic masculinity problem during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a co-star on Game of Thrones, who was herself 31 years old, stated that he was considering "deep down" on going over this problem.
"I'm thinking personally about this right now. What have we done wrong with the issue of masculinity?
From the point of view of this problem we're having right now, what are we teaching men wrong as they grow up?"
Kit believes television may be involved in strengthening toxic masculinity due to overmasculin characters.
Kit continued: "What was born, what was taught?
What is it that young men are taught on television and on the street that these young men feel compelled to have certain characteristics of manhood?
I think one of the most important questions of our time is how can we change it?
Because for young men, it is clear that things have gone wrong."
Kit said in an interview that he would not play in episodes or sequels of the series characters after the end of the Games of Thrones next summer, and that he was no longer "bored of battlefields and horses".
Kit will play Sam Shepard's re-released Wild West in November, and the play tells the story of a filmmaker and his thieving brother.
The actor had recently announced that the most beautiful thing that Game of Thrones had added to him was his introduction to his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way the show presented me with my future family and my life after that," Kit said.
Rose had played the girlfriend of Jon Snow, starring Kit in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of HIV and Aids citizens.
According to health officials, the virus affected more than 820,000 people in the country.
More than 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Unlike cases in the past, many of the new cases were said to have been transmitted through sexual intercourse.
In the past, the HIV virus had spread quickly as a result of infected blood transfusions in parts of China.
However, Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan state said that the number of people infected with HIV virus through blood transfusions has almost dropped to zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China increased by 100,000 people each year.
The HIV virus, which is transmitted through sexual intercourse, is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality is stated to have continued discrimination against LGBT individuals, although it was removed from crime in China in 1997.
Studies estimate that 70% to 90% of men who have sexual relations with men marry women due to the country's conservative values.
The disease is often transmitted due to the lack of adequate attention to protection during these homosexual relationships.
The Chinese government has pledged to provide general access to HIV drugs as part of its anti-disease work starting in 2003.
Maxine Waters criticized "dangerous lies" and "comployment theories", denying the claim that one of her employees leaked data from Republican Party senators.
US Congressman Maxine Waters denied allegations Saturday that one of her employees shared the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Senators' Wikipedia pages.
Los Angeles MP Waters of the Democratic Party suggested that the allegations were supported by "extremely right-wing" political commentators and websites.
Waters used the phrase "Lies, lies and lower lies" in a statement on Twitter.
Shared information includes South Carolina U.S. senator Lindsey Graham and Utah senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch's home addresses and phone numbers.
This information about the Members of Congress was posted online on Thursday by an unidentified person during a Senate group session regarding allegations of sexual abuse against High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to the report on Hill, websites in conservative view such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address for the source of the posts was connected to Waters' office, and released information from one of Waters' employees.
Waters used the phrase "These unfounded claims are all wrong and plain lies," in relation to the issue.
"My employee, who has compromised his identity, personal information and security due to these false and unfounded allegations, is in no way responsible for the infiltration of these information.
These unfounded claims are completely false and utterly false."
Waters' statement attracted some people's response online, and White House press secretary Ari Fleischer was among those who expressed his reaction.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote in his statement.
"It shows that Waters does not have the itidale necessary to become Congressman.
When someone's accused of a crime they didn't commit, they shouldn't get angry.
He must not show intolerance to criticism.
The accuser must not question his intentions.
He needs to be calm and relaxed."
Fleischer contrasted Waters' reaction with Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized by the Democrats for looking very angry at the session held on Thursday.
Republican Omar Navarro, who ran for Waters' seat in the by-election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter:
"If it's true, the ground will move."
Waters said in a statement that his office "informs concerned officials and the police department about these false allegations."
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed and answer to the law for these dangerous actions that could harm all my employees," Waters said in his statement.
Johnny English review of his film Again at Work: Rowan Atkinson's inadequate agent parody
It has now become a tradition to associate all British-made new films with Brexit, which we can also continue for the Johnny English action comedy parody, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and again appeared on the white screen with the film Return of Johnny English in 2011.
Is our country going to have an opportunity to export our ironic film, where we satirize ourselves about how screwed up we are?
At least, the inept Johnny English character, noted for his exploding eyes and moving gestures, was able to renew his license to screw things up once again. In fact, even the name Johnny English shows that the character is an inclusive comedy element developed towards movie lovers who do not speak English.
Johnny English is an absurd undercover agent inspired by a character who, despite his strangely confident and amiable appeal, is a bit from Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bean, and a little from that character who accompanied Chariots of Fire promotional music at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
In fact, for this covert agent role, he was also inspired by an international mysterious traveler who was played by Atkinson in now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, who eventually created chaos at the end of everything he did.
You might find some funny scenes in this new Johnny English movie.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter in his medieval battle armor and hit the helicopter propeller's helmet and made a sound.
Atkinson's physical comedy skill fills the eye, but I find the humor element in the film very weak and strangely unnecessary, especially given that "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Danger also confidently incorporated comedy material into their scripts, the film's humor can be seen to be too much.
His sense of humor in the film seems more directed towards children than adults, and I don't think the strange misfortunes that happened to Johnny English are as creative and thought out misfortunes as Atkinson's character in the silent film comedy is in Bean.
In this film of the series, the issue deals with the serious danger of Great Britain.
A cyber-criminal infiltrates the UK's top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all the agents working the field in England, and terrorizing the agent who's keeping watch at night, and unfortunately we only see Kevin Eldon, who plays the character of the sentry agent, in this small role.
For a self-righteous prime minister whose political popularity has come to a complete point of extinction, this is the last straw: Emma Thompson has done her best to portray this character that resembles Theresa May, but the script does not offer a text that can be worked and developed.
The prime minister's intelligence advisers state that all active agents have been identified and that he must assign a retired agent to do so.
This retired agent is Johnny English, who teaches at a school where rich students study after retirement while also teaching how to become undercover agents off the record: There were some funny jokes in these scenes in which English founded a School of Rock-type spy academy.
English is immediately being taken to Whitehall Palace for an emergency briefing and is reunited with Bough, his former abbot played by Ben Miller.
Bough is married to a submarine officer, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays Bough's wife, is a little wasted in this role.
The two, known in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are thrown back on the adventure as he has horribly ruined everything, and they meet the beautiful femme fatale character Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister is under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims that Britain can solve the cyber problem: this evil character, Jason Volta, is portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventures full of absurd entertainment: they dress up as waiters and set fire to a luxury French restaurant; they cause turmoil while trying to sneak onto Volta's luxury yacht. English causes complete chaos while trying to use the Virtual Reality glasses to learn Volta's plan.
All of these events connect to a point at the end of the script, but the film has a sense of humor in television programs aimed at children in general, no matter how cute and hilarious.
The jokes are quite mediocre.
Like in other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
Labour rejects claims that it has developed a plan for British employees to start work four days a week and charge five days a week
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to develop a radical plan involving employees working four days a week with no cuts in their salaries.
Rumour has it that the company wants its patrons to extend their week's vacation another day and benefit workers from savings achieved through artificial intelligence.
According to the plan, employees will have three days of week vacation, but will continue to receive the same fee.
Sources said the idea was "fit" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to direct the country to useful policies for workers.
The British Labour Unions Congress also supports the offer to work four days a week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected by the end of the year.
This is not a plan that can happen overnight, but the idea of working four days a week is a request in line with the party's policy of rebalancing the economy in favor of workers and its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first party to suggest this idea, the Green Party has pledged to work four days a week in the 2017 general election campaign.
This request, however, is not already supported by the entire Labour Party.
"The four-day working plan is not among the party's policies and is not currently evaluated by the party," said a Labour spokesman.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell detailed his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from "unidentified executives" in public services firms and "ranters".
The Shadow Chancellor's plans, since the Labour government can "cuts" in the event of corruption, also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies will not be able to get their share of the company back.
McDonnell also confirmed plans for workers to take part in the company's boards, and the Shadow Chancellor also plans to create Comprehensive Property Funds for private sector firms to hand over 10% of their equity to employees. The ten per cent means 500 pounds of annual savings, tops.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy announced on "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation will change their minds about Kavanaugh
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused the final vote for the judge's nomination for High Court membership to be delayed by at least a week, which raises the question whether Republican senators will withdraw their support due to findings in the FBI report.
In Sunday's "60 Minutes" interview, reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for a finding to emerge that could change their minds in the FBI investigation.
Kennedy seemed more open to changing his mind compared to his South Carolina colleague.
Kennedy said in an interview, "Of course,
I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh on my way to the hearing.
After this claim was made, I called him and said, "Did you do this?"
Kavanaugh was brave, determined and clear," he said.
On the other hand, Graham seems less likely to change the game.
"I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it has to be a very serious charge to change my mind," Graham said.
Graham addressed Christine Blasey Ford, who made the claim, saying, "Dr. Ford, I don't know what it is, but I do know this: Brett, he absolutely rejected this claim."
"No one that Ford named can confirm this claim.
It's been 36 years since it happened.
I don't think you have anything new to change."
What Is the Global Citizen Festival and What Has It Done to Reduce Poverty?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival this Saturday, which is an annual music event performed by extremely impressive stars, and the event's mission is as ambitious as the performers on stage: ending poverty worldwide.
For the seventh Global Citizen Festival this year, tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park, both watching performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and raising awareness about the mission to end extreme poverty by 2030, the actual target of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project (Project Global Poverty).The Global Poverty Project is an international pressure group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively struggling with poverty.
If those who want to participate in the concert do not want to pay for the VIP ticket, they must perform certain tasks or "actions" to earn a free ticket to the event, including volunteering, e-mailing world leaders, helping to raise awareness about the goal of calling specific people or ending poverty.
And how successful was the Global Citizen Festival that remained 12 years to accomplish its goal?
Does giving people free concert tickets really convince people to demand action, or is there a situation called "clicktivism" that makes people feel like they're really making a difference by signing or tweeting a petition online?
The Global Citizen movement reported that its supporters had made 19 million "actions" in which many different targets were requested to be realized from 2011.
According to the Global Citizen group, these actions contributed to the world leaders' statement of commitments and declarations reaching a total budget of more than $37 billion, and these commitments and declarations are intended to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and declarations as a result of the actions of supporters, and that at least $10 billion of them had already been paid or collected.
The Global Citizen group estimates that funds secured have directly affected the lives of about 649 million people worldwide so far.
Notable organisations in the commitments include the UK-based association "The Power of Nutrition" (The Power of Nutrition) which is a collaboration of investors and project practitioners intended to "help children grow by fulfilling all their potentials." The association pledged to donate $35 million to the country after receiving 4700 tweets from Global Citizen supporters to help end the malnutrition issue in Rwanda.
In a live concert in April 2018, The Power of Nutrition envoy Tracey Ullman told viewers: "With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and supporters of Global Citizen, we can eliminate the malnutrition problem, a social injustice."
According to the Global Citizen group's statement, after calling for over 5,000 actions to call for the British government to act on improving mother and child nutrition, the government announced that it would provide funding for The Power of Nutrition (Power of Nutrition) project and that the project would reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to the question "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?" in the Frequently Asked Questions on the website of the Global Citizen Festival.
The answer was: "This will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But we will succeed because we are stronger together, like all the civil rights movements and anti-discrimination movements before us.
Artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will also perform at the event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman in New York this year.
The Home Secretary has announced that the United States can use the Navy for a "abluka" to block Russian energy exports
According to the Washington Examiner, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke expressed that they could use the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy sources from reaching world markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's Syrian intervention is an excuse to explore new energy markets, but Russia is carrying out its operations in Syria on the call of the legitimate government.
"I think the goal of the Russians' intervention in the Middle East is to make energy deals in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," Zinke was quoted as saying.
He also suggested that there were various ways and means to combat it.
"We as the United States have the power to ensure that the maritime roads remain open thanks to our Navy, and if necessary, we can close these roads so that Russian energy does not reach the markets," Zinke said.
Ryan Zinke addressed participants at the event in the United States, which described him as the "voice of the energy consumer" and organized the non-profit band Consumer Energy Alliance.
In the continuation of his speech, Zinke compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, stating that these two countries were in almost the same situation.
"One of the economic options at our table on Iran and Russia is to pressure them and take their place in terms of energy," Zinke said, describing Russia as a country that has "successed in one field" with its fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements were on top of the mission initiated by the Trump administration to replace Russian natural gas, a much cheaper alternative for European consumers, and increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe.
In this mission context, officials of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are working to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "series" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project is just an economic project, which will double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project has only economic reasons, and that it sets an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, who met with US Energy Minister Rick Perry at a meeting in Moscow in September, noted: "I believe we agree that energy cannot be used as a means of printing enforcement and consumers must be free to choose the supplier they want."
The U.S. stance attracted the reaction of Germany, which again expressed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Federation (BDI), one of Germany's leading organisations in the field of industry, called for the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am deeply uncomfortable with the third-party companies interfering in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industrial Federation, after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that she would "think about running for office" in the 2020 Presidential Race
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that following the by-elections, she would consider the presidential nomination "extremely".
Warren, who attended the city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, confirmed that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the corrupt government system, and a woman has to go to the top for that," Hill reported.
"After November 6, I will consider the presidential nomination thoroughly," Warren said.
Warren, who also commented on President Donald Trump at the city council meeting, testified that Trump had "drawn the country in a wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," he said.
Warren had expressed criticism of Trump and Trump's High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet he posted on Monday, the Senator used the phrase "of course the FBI needs to investigate before voting."
On the other hand, according to a poll announced Thursday, most of Warren's own supporters do not want him to run in 2020.
According to the survey carried out by the Suffolk University Center for Political Studies/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support running.
The poll showed that the number of people who supported Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy was higher, and the proportion of those who supported Patrick's nomination was 48 percent.
Other prominent Democratic candidates named as candidates in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden will officially decide whether to run by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin mentioned Track Palin's PTSD at the Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
Track Palin was arrested Monday night for alleged violence against woman
Sarah Palin addressed listeners at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma: "After what my own son went through when he returned to his country, I understand better the sufferings of post-traumatic stress disorder and injuries brought with our soldiers."
Palin commented that his son's arrest reflects a "obvious fact that has been ignored." "They have changed from the war a little and are emotionally hardened. They come wondering if their fellow soldiers, pilots and other members of the army will be respected for the sacrifices they have made for this country."
Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman at Wasilla Police Centre, announced his arrest in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday for allegations that Track Palin had been violent towards the woman, attempted to intervene in the reporting of the case of violence, and held a gun while drunk.
18 states and Columbia District supports appeal to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia supports legal objection to the new U.S. policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia in Washington presented an expert report to the court Friday in support of an asylum seeker who objected to the new policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff was not revealed in the Grace versus Sessions case, which opened in August to appeal federal policy by the American Civil Liberties Union.
Grace stated that her partner and her "sons of violent gang members" were violent against her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
Grace was taken into custody in Texas.
Lawyers defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, the home of most of those applying for asylum in the United States, as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence issues.
Along with the new US asylum policy, the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision was overturned, allowing asylum seekers to apply for asylum.
In a statement Friday, Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine stated that the new policy "dismisses federal and international laws with state laws".
"Federal law states that all asylum demands must be decided according to the specific situation and circumstances of the demand, and such a ban violates that principle," the expert said in his report.
In addition, lawyers argued that the lack of access to immigrants by new policy in the report damaged the U.S. economy, with the possibility that immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary workforce".
U.S. Justice Minister Jeff Sessions asked judges who handled immigration cases in June not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
While announcing the policy on 11 June, the Sessions announced that "those who have suffered persecution or fear of being persecuted because of the race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion they belong to may seek asylum."
"Pression policy certainly does not carry the goal of mitigating all the problems that people face every day all over the world. Even if these problems are serious problems, the situation is the same."
In Palu, where the death toll has doubled, relief teams are competing with time to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse and worse.
35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who is trying to comfort her hot baby at an evacuation center in Palu, where hopes are running out, said, "I feel very nervous.
There's an ambulance coming every minute carrying bodies.
We are experiencing a shortage of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their fallen homes, trying to collect water - damaged belongings and salvage everything they had found.
In the disaster, where hundreds of people were injured, hospitals damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake were flooded with wounded.
Some wounded, such as Dwi Haris, with fractures to his spine and shoulder, were treated in the garden of Palu Military Hospital, where the injured were treated in front of the hospital due to continued aftershocks.
Haris spoke in tears of his feelings during the severe earthquake in the room where he and his wife and daughter were staying on the fifth floor of a hotel.
In an interview with the Associated Press, Haris quoted those moments as saying: "We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I'm stuck under a wall wreck." Haris and his family were in town to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of bullying using "propaganda ads"
The official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement praising the mutual advantages of U.S.-China trade in a daily newspaper printed in the United States, a week after this ad, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading its propaganda using American media.
US President Donald Trump referred to the paid advertisement published by China Daily in the Iowa state's best-selling newspaper Des Moines Register last Wednesday, Trump began his statements by accusing China of interfering in congressional elections on November 6th, China denies allegations of intervention.
Trump's accusation of trying to intervene in the US elections shows a new phase in the campaign, initiated and expanded by Washington to pressure China, according to US officials speaking to Reuters.
It is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements for promoting trade, but due to the deepening commercial war between Beijing and Washington, both countries impose high customs taxes on each other for imports.
According to US experts, during the early stages of the trade war, China's customs taxes for retaliation were intended to influence exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the long-running former governor of the state of Iowa exporting agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his column for the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that China "doubled its tyranny by publishing propaganda ads in the free American media".
Branstad used the following statements in his writing: "The Chinese government is taking advantage of the principle of freedom of expression and free press traditions that America is firmly committed to by publishing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register to spread its propaganda."
"On the other hand, when you go to a newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you can see that there are few newspapers publishing dissenting views, and you can find no publication that accurately reflects Chinese views on the country's difficult economic progress because the media is under the strict control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
Branstad stated in his article that "one of China's leading newspapers has rejected his offer to publish his article", but did not name the paper.
Analysts Say With Kavanaugh Failure, Republicans Move Women Voters Away Before Intermediate Elections
The leading figures of the Republican Party supported and defended High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, while analysts warned that Republicans would react especially from women in the coming by-election.
People had strong feelings about it, and most Republicans made statements that they wanted to continue voting.
Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at the Maxwell Institute of Syracuse University, stated in a statement for an article published in Hill on Sunday that "such declarations cannot be retracted."
Reeher doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona representative)'s insistence on an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to reconcile angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will remember what happened in the future and in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for progressive group MoveOn, a newspaper in Washington, D.C.
According to Mic, members of the Republican Party, who form the majority of the Judiciary Committee, said that since Dr. Christine Blasey chose to continue the nomination process for Kavanaugh despite Ford's testimony, the activists chanted slogans "November is coming up!" in the corridors of the Senate.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be unorthodox," said neutral political analyst Stu Rothenberg, speaking to a news website.
Rothenberg said, "People say enthusiasm and motivation are already high; that thought is true.
But when they don't like the president in the contested electoral districts, the motivation of women voters and young voters in the suburbs who don't usually vote can grow even more," he said.
Before Ford's public statement, which he detailed his allegations of sexual assault on the Supreme Court candidate, had yet to take place, analysts suggested that Republican Party members could face the reaction if they insisted on approval.
"This issue has become inextricable in terms of the Republican Party," NBC News reported Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Party National Committee.
"It's not just a committee vote, final vote or whether Kavanaugh is a member of the Supreme Court. It's also important to ask questions about how Republican Party members handled the issue and how they treated Ford," Guy Cecil, director of the group Priorities USA, who assisted the Democratic Party in the elections, commented to a news channel.
On the other hand, Americans seem to have split over who to believe after Ford's and Kavanaugh's statements, and the number of those who sided with Ford is slowly increasing.
According to YouGov's new poll, 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony absolutely or partially, while 35 percent said they firmly or partially believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
Also, 38 percent of respondents thought Kavanaugh was definitely or possibly lying during his testimony, while the ratio of those who used the same expression for Ford was limited to only 30 percent.
According to a report in the Guardian, the FBI began investigating Ford's and at least one more of the other complaints after Flake's request, the second complaint involved in the investigation was Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified on the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh, who was under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17, had been sexually assaulted.
Ramirez claimed that Supreme Court candidate Kavanaugh showed him his genitals during a party they attended during their training at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web's Inventor Plans to Launch a New Internet Project That Will Compete With Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is setting up a new startup aimed at competing against firms such as Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of technology legend, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to determine where the data will be stored and which people can access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said, mixed with the joke, that Inrupt's original intention was "to dominate the world".
"We had to do this now," Lee said about the startup.
"This is an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows users to create their own "personal online data storage space" or, otherwise, POD.
This storage area can include contact lists, calendars, to-do lists, music library and other personal and professional tools.
The application offers an experience similar to using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify simultaneously from a single browser.
The unique feature that separates the personal data storage field from other technologies is that it gives the user complete control over who can access what information.
The company calls this concept "personal empowerment through data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the basic idea in the establishment of the Inrupt company was to put together resources, transactions and appropriate skills that would help offer Solid to the use of everyone.
The company currently employs a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a community of some developers and volunteer encoders working under contract on the project.
From this week, technology developers from all over the world can develop their own non-central applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he or his team "did not discuss whether to make a change with Facebook and Google that would upset all business models overnight."
"We don't ask for their permission," Lee said.
Berners-Lee announced the mission of Inrupt in a post published in Medium on Saturday: "Providing commercial energy and ecosystem to help maintain the integrity and quality of the new web system built on Solid".
Berners-Lee radically changed the Internet in 1994, establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become one of the prominent figures in the discussion of network neutrality.
Berners-Lee, who launched Inrupt; will continue to be the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new age of the Web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: The priest who received the Victoria Cross in World War I was commemorated
The only English Church priest to qualify for the Victoria Cross as a combatant in World War I was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann qualified to receive this engagement on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But Vann, who was killed four days later by a sniper, never learned that he was honored with Britain's highest military engagement.
On Saturday, Rushden inaugurated the commemorative memorial of Vann's two grandchildren at the Northamptonshire parade.
Vann's grandson Michael Vann stated that it was a "perfect symbol" that the monument's grandfather opened after 100 years of heroism, which was honored with military engagement.
On 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann had made the battalion pass the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very misty weather, under the lead rain of artillery and machine guns", according to the London Gazette.
He then quickly ran towards the line of fire, pulling forward the line of fire "with great courage" and walking alone on a field ball, knocking down three men from the platoon.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, commented on his grandfather's actions, "a heroism that I know I will never reach but also humbles man."
Michael and his brother Dr. James Vann also left a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he was "greatly honored to take part in the parade" and stated that "the courage of a true hero has been proved by many people with the support given."
The MMA fans, who stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, met Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine if you stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 and were not given the opportunity to watch the actual event.
There were 13 fights on the list set in San Jose, six of which were on Main Card and aired live throughout the night in the United Kingdom via Channel 5.
Audiences in the United Kingdom were shocked when the broadcast suddenly switched to the Peppa Pig cartoon as the meeting of Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald was about to begin at 06:00.
Some viewers who didn't sleep all night for the fight weren't happy.
One of the MMA fans described the broadcast's switch to cartoons as a "bad joke" on Twitter.
Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator marketing and communications department, answered the question about the broadcast, "The network had to switch to the cartoon because the content of the publication had government regulations that were not suitable for 6:00 a.m.," said Dave Schwartz.
"Yes, 'Peppa the pig' was released," Schwartz said.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on timetables so fans in the United Kingdom could also watch future broadcasts.
"I think we can probably get it back on track," Coker said in a statement regarding the change of broadcast.
"But it is Sunday in England and it is six o'clock in the morning that we cannot solve this problem until Monday, according to Sunday, England, according to our time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the cartoon went on the air, we got a lot of messages, and some of them weren't very friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem because we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't a technical error, it was a matter of regulations.
I promise it won't happen again next time.
We're going to put up five fights instead of six, like we normally do, when we're trying to offer better to MMA fans, we run into this problem.
It's unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley explained that he felt like a "second-rate person" because of his sexual orientation.
Olympic jumper Tom Daley explained that he felt like a second-rate person due to his sexual orientation, but that feeling gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he did not realize that "not everyone is like him" until he began middle school.
Daley said in a statement to the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program, first presented by Lauren Laverne, that the aim of speaking about gay rights was to "hope" others.
He also added that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics after becoming a father.
Kirsty Young, the original host of the long-running radio show, was on leave for several months due to his illness.
In this program, when guests thought they were stranded on an island and decided on what they wanted to take with them, Laverne's first guest was Daley, who stated that when Daley was growing up, he saw himself "down" from everyone else because "a person's interest in both boys and girls is not socially acceptable."
Daley made the following statements about the matter: "To this day, these feelings of inadequacy and the feeling of being different from everyone else provided me with the strength and endurance necessary to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove he was "important" in the past so that people would not be disappointed when they found out about his sexual orientation.
Having two bronze Olympic medals, he became a well-known LGBT advocate and called for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality at Commonwealth Games competitions, which he participated in this year in Australia.
Daley stated that he felt lucky that he did not face any legal problems for explaining his homosexuality, that he wanted to give others "hope", and therefore made his thoughts on the subject clear.
A three-time world champion, he told a man that he had fallen in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "when he never expected."
Daley married an Oscar director 20 years older than him last year, but the athlete notes that the age difference was never a problem.
Daley, who first participated in the Olympics when he was 14 years old and lost his father to cancer three years later, said it was difficult to find a peer who had experienced similar ups and downs in life "when he had been through so much at a young age."
The couple enjoyed the joy of being a parent by adopting a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, with Daley saying that after becoming a father, "the whole perspective has changed".
"If you had asked that question last year, all I would have cared about was getting a gold medal," the athlete explained.
But there's more to the Olympics than gold medals.
For me, the Olympic gold medal was Robbie."
Daley's son bears the name of his father Robert, who was diagnosed with brain cancer and died in 2011 when he was 40 years old.
Daley's story is that his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they bought tickets to the London 2012 Olympics because he wanted to watch the games in the first place.
"I couldn't tell him, Dad, you won't live to watch the games from the first row," Daley said.
Daley described his father's experiences at the time of his death: "I was holding his hand the moment he stopped breathing, I couldn't accept that he wasn't invincible until he actually gave up his last breath and died."
The Olympic athlete competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics a year after his father's death and won a bronze medal.
"I've known all my life that I've dreamed about it: jumping in front of fans of my own country. It wouldn't feel any better," Daley said while describing the Olympics.
This also influenced his selection of the first song, Daley's choice being the Proud song by Heather Small, which meant a great deal to him as he prepared for the Olympic games and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15pm according to Britain's Summer Hour on Sundays.
Dropping out of shape, Mickelson was pulled out of the game at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record by making his 47th appearance at the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he has to regain his form so that this record is not a sad turning point.
Having participated in the event every two years for the 12th time, Mickelson, a record-breaker, was picked up from the game by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fours and fours (foursome) games.
Mickelson, a five-time major champion, was usually at the center of events on the U.S. team, but spent this Saturday cheering for his team or training on the field in hopes of solving the problem that caused his performance to drop in the game.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old athlete whose drive hits were not smooth enough, is not the ideal choice for the tough Le Golf National trackway where the faulty tackles in the long rough did not go unpunished.
As if the course itself was not challenging enough, Mickelson will fight British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, with Molinari winning all four of his four games this week with inexperienced teammate Tommy Fleetwood.
The American team, which is four points behind Sunday's 12 singles game, would certainly gain great importance if it could start the game quickly.
Furyk explained that he trusted his teammate, and he couldn't have said anything different.
The U.S. captain used the following statements for his teammate: "Mickelson fully understood his role today, said he would be ready for tomorrow by patting me on the back and throwing his arm over my shoulder."
"He's so confident.
Mickelson is a player who signed up for Hall of Fame, a name that has contributed a lot to the teams he's played for in the past, and to our team this week.
It wasn't in my mind to play him in two games.
I thought you were going to play more games, but it had to be this way, so we decided we had to keep playing.
Of course, Mickelson wants to be on the field like everybody else."
Mickelson will set Nick Faldo's record for most players who have participated in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
For Mickelson, this match could mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which he never fully achieved in his individual records.
According to Furyk, Mickelson gave the team a spiritual advantage with his presence; he won 18 games, lost 20 games, and tied in seven games.
The team captain said of Mickelson: "He has a funny, sarcastic and humorous personality, he likes to joke around with people, he's a really great friend to spend time in the team room."
I think the young players were happy to get a chance to fight him this week, and it was fun to watch them fight.
He's doing more than just playing."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows the big difference can soon be closed.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, saw earlier that it could easily become an uncomfortable draw to enter the single games by a large margin.
The Danish player made his debut at Valderrama in 1997, where Seve Ballesteros' team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, was ahead of the Americans by five points, but at the end of the game they won by a very small nose difference, such as 141⁄2–131⁄2.
After watching the 2018 team win 5–3 at Le Golf National on Friday and yesterday at Le Golf National with a big 10–6 score, Bjorn (to photoplay), made the following statement: "I constantly remind myself: we were ahead by a big margin at Valderrama, we were ahead by a big margin at Brookline but lost by a very small margin at Brookline, we also won by a very small margin at Valderrama."
History reminds me and the players of the rival team that nothing is over yet.
We'll play full performance tomorrow.
We're gonna go out there and do everything we have to do.
By the time the score is on the scoreboard, nothing is over.
We have a goal, we're trying to win this trophy, and that should be our whole focus.
I've been saying the same thing from the start. My focus is on my 12 players on my team, but we all know who we're fighting on the opposing team. We have the best players in the world."
Happy with his players' performance on the hard golf course, Bjorn said: "I'm never sure of myself in this game.
Tomorrow is a completely different day.
Tomorrow, individual performances will come forward, and the things we need to do will change.
It's a great feeling to play with your partner if everything's going well, but when you go out on your own, you're tested in full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message we have to pass on to the players:
You need to leave your partner now, and your partner needs to get out there and perform his best."
Jim Furyk, captain of the rival team, expects his players to perform better individually than their partnered match, which does not apply to Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four games.
Furyk, who had been on both the losing and winning sides of the matches where the team's fortune changed at the last minute, was on the losing side in the European team's "Miracle in Medinah" victory while on the victorious side at Brookline.
Answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999 motivated his players on the last day, Furyk said, "I remember exactly what he said."
The captain of the American team continued his statement: "We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you need to start the game quickly, as in Brookline or Medinah.
Once the momentum is on your side, there's a big job for the players of the central games.
So we did our lineup according to this, and we uncovered players whose performance we believe to be high, you know, we're going to try to create a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas took up the task of leading the counteroffensive and will face Rory McIlroy in the first match, while the other players of the first half of the European team's list are Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"I chose to play the players I chose in this order because I think this line is suitable for all matches from start to finish," Bjorn said in relation to the players he selected for single games.
Germany's new warship's entry date has been delayed once again.
The new frigate of the German Navy would replace the Cold War-era warships, beginning service in 2014, but due to malfunctioning systems and increased cost, reports in local media, the frigate will not be available until next year.
According to information from a military source speaking to the newspaper Die Zeit, the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates' flagship "Rheinland-Pfalz" was postponed into service, for now to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the German Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery never left its grip on the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the German Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
The ships were said to have Stealth (invisible ship) technologies such as low-frequency radar, infrared and acoustic signature, as well as a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles.
Other important features of the ship include the longer maintenance intervals, with new frigates expected to be able to serve up to two years away from the anchor port.
But according to Die Zeit, Germany's state-of-the-art warships, which are said to enable it to deploy its forces overseas, will already be obsolete by the time they enter service.
The F125 frigate, unable to survive misfortunes, had been headlined last year when the German Navy officially refused to service the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
The Navy returned the ship, which was first delivered along with this incident, to the ship's manufacturer.
No details were given about the reasons for the extradition, however, reports in the German media said that there were a number of critical "writing and hardware errors" that would render the ship useless if the ship was put on a combat mission.
Software errors are particularly important as Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be used by 120 shipmen who correspond to half the number of personnel working in former Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship was too heavy to reduce performance and restricted the possibility of Marine Corps personnel to change the ship in the future.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" was said to weigh twice as much as the ships in similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides imperfect equipment, the cost of the entire project, including training for staff, has become a problem.
The project price allegedly rose from the starting price of 2.2 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 US).
With warnings that Germany's power in the seas is diminishing, problems in the new frigates also become significant.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that "ships suitable for revenge have been reduced".
The head of the defence committee expressed that the problem grew over time, as former ships were removed from service, but were not replaced by new ships.
The president was upset that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were eligible to join the Navy.
The National Trust Association is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
A new study is being conducted in a field in the Highlands, Scotland, to understand how bats took advantage of the land during hunting.
The study hopes that the findings will shed light on the behavior of bats, the only mammal that flies, and will guide future conservation efforts.
The study carried out by scientists working at Scotland's National Trust for Scotland association will follow the common dwarf bats and Mediterranean dwarf bats located at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as the brown long-eared bats and the Daubenton bats.
During the season, special recording devices will be placed at key points of the property to track the activities of bats.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile work using the detectors held.
After sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the bat sounds will be determined to determine which species does.
Subsequently, a habitat map and report will be prepared to create a detailed picture of the behaviour of bats across the land.
Rob Dewar, NTS' nature conservation consultant, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are more important to bats and how these areas are used by each bat species.
This information will help to benefit habitat management work such as creating grasslands, as well as determine how wooded areas can best be preserved for bats and related species.
There has been a serious decline in bat population in Scotland and across the United Kingdom in the past century.
Bats are threatened by construction and construction jobs that affect their perch and cause them to lose their habitat.
Other factors that pose risks for bats include wind turbines, lighting tools, mosquito nets, chemical procedures used in some building materials, and attacks by house cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
At night, however, their ears are more useful in catching prey because of their hunting habits.
Bats use an advanced ecolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight pathways.
NTS, responsible for the preservation of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, puts great emphasis on bats.
The association regularly employs ten trained experts who conduct research, perch reviews, and sometimes rescue activities.
The organization established Scotland's first and only shelter for bats on Three grounds of Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten different bat species.
David Thompson, the manager of the land, stated that the land was an ideal area for bats.
"We have a great area for bats in Threave," Thompson said.
Land manager Thompson said of the matter: "We have old buildings, numerous old trees, and a beautiful habitat.
But we still don't know much about bats, so our work here and in other areas will help us understand what bats need to develop."
Thompson underscores the need to check if there are bats in buildings before they begin maintenance work, the accidental destruction of a single maternal perch could result in the destruction of the entire local population as a result of the deaths of nearly 400 females and baby bats.
Bats are protected animals that are forbidden to kill, disturb or harm bats or destroy their perches.
The Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust association, Elisabeth Ferrell, invited people to contribute to the project.
Ferrell said in his statement: "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know what the populations of many species living in our area are like."
Ronaldo's lawyers, who denied rape allegations, are preparing to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations "the lying news" and suggested that people were trying to "make their own introductions" using the name Ronaldo.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes the allegations.
The Portuguese national team and Juventus striker Ronaldo had allegedly raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to a report in Der Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldo was later suggested to have paid her $375,000 to stop talking about the incident.
Hours after the allegations found a place in the media, Ronaldo, 33, speaking to 142 million followers on Instagram live coverage, said the allegations were "false news".
The five-time winner of the Golden Ball (Ballon d'Or) award said to the camera, "No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is a lie."
"They want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, I don't have a problem," he added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations that they have deemed "inadmissible reporting of doubts in the area of privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the footballer would demand compensation for "the moral damage that corresponds to the size of this violation, perhaps one of the most serious personal rights violations seen in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in a room at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents at Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the footballer's room after meeting at a nightclub, where Ronaldo raped Mayorga.
Mayorga argues that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was a "good man" at 99 percent and that "one percent" had been betrayed.
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the two were having sexual relations, but this is within the consent of the two parties.
Mayorga argues that he went to the police and that his injuries were photographed at the hospital but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was "afraid of revenge" and was "disappointed in public".
Mayorga, 34, says he is still suffering from the alleged trauma, so he is looking for ways to break the compromise.
Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, this summer he transferred to the Italian giant Juventus for 100 million euros.
Brexit: England will "always regret" losing automobile manufacturers
Trade Minister Greg Clark said that Britain would "always regret" if it lost its world leadership position in automotive production after Brexit.
Toyota added that it was "concerning" that Britain informed the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need to make a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car company said that in the case of an uncontracted Brexit, the extension of the waiting time at the border could cause people to lose their jobs.
The Burnaston facility, which produced Toyota Auris and Avensis, had produced 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota's Burnaston factory, said, "My view is that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory."
Car manufacturers such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover also raised fear that it would leave the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade would work.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini facility in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The main concerns are based on what automobile manufacturers call the risks in the supply chain if Brexit happens without a deal.
The Toyota production line operates with "just in time" pieces from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom cars, coming every 37 minutes.
If the UK withdraws from the EU on 29 March without an agreement, customs may fail, which, according to industry, could lead to disruptions, delays, and the failure to supply parts.
The firm said it was impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's inventory at the Derbyshire facility, so production would stop.
Clark said Theresa May's plans for Chequers in terms of future relations with the EU were "clearly adjusted to get ahead of these controls at the border".
"We need to make a deal, as I said, not just a deal that will lead us to success for now, but we want to make the best deal that will help us get this opportunity," BBC Radio 4 said on Today.
"According to evidence from other manufacturers, not just Toyota, we should definitely be able to maintain our highly successful supply chains."
Toyota failed to determine how long production would last, but warned that in the longer term additional costs would reduce the facility's competitiveness and ultimately put people out of business.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year employee at Burnaston and the facility's Unite unity meeting organizer, said his members were increasingly concerned: "As far as my experience is concerned, when these things disappear, he will never come back.
"We need to come up with a clear and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU," a government spokesman said.
White House: Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again
On Sunday, the White House said that Donald Trump's big meeting with Deputy Justice Rod Rosenstein "could be postponed for another week", as discussions about High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continued.
Rosenstein manages Russia's election intervention, Trump's aides and Russia's connections, and special authority prosecutor Robert Mueller, who explores the possibility of obstructing justice.
The question of whether Trump would lay off his deputy minister by endangering Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumours in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein had opened up a discussion about wearing a wire to record his conversations with Trump and dismantling the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the story.
However, he went to the White House last Monday amid allegations that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was in New York at the time at the United Nations.
Trump said he "discharged" Rosenstein not to fire, but then the meeting was postponed so that it would not coincide with the Senate Justice Commission hearing between Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, one of the two women who accused him of sexual abuse with Kavanaugh and whose statements were appealed.
On Friday, Trump again postponed the Senate's full vote, ordering the FBI to investigate allegations against Kavanaugh for a week.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said, "No date has been set for this, it may be this week, but it is also possible that it will be postponed another week, given everything else in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'll always want to keep the press informed of the developments," he said.
Some reporters oppose this statement as follows: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, host of the program, asked why.
Sanders said that the reason that the briefings were scarce was not because TV reporters "played in the stands" but added: "But I can't deny that they also played in the stands."
Sanders later suggested that direct contact with Trump and the press would increase.
"Trump is holding more questions-answer sessions than any other president before him," he said, adding without funding, "We have looked at the numerical data."
"The briefings will continue, but it would be much better if the press had the chance to direct their questions about the United States directly to the president than to talk to me.
We try to do this often, and in recent weeks you've seen us do it many times, and when you can speak directly to the President of the United States, it will replace the press briefing," said the president.
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with high-ranking visitors.
Solo press conferences don't happen often.
The president has shown perhaps why by speaking too freely in front of reporters gathered in New York this week and occasionally giving strange images.
Health Minister letters to EU employees at Scotland NHS about concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health sent letters to EU employees at the National Health Service of Scotland (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and ask them to continue working during the period after Brexit.
Scottish Member of Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government had already promised to undertake the expense of finalised position applications for EU citizens working in the transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "The talks on the withdrawal between Britain and the EU lasted throughout the summer, and the way for the expected decisions to be made this fall has been opened.
But the UK government also stepped up their preparations in case there was no deal.
I realize this is a very difficult time for all of you.
So I wanted to say once again how much I value the contributions of every member of our working staff, no matter which nation.
Our colleagues in the EU and outside also offer valuable experience and skills that benefit the patients and communities we serve while strengthening and improving health care work.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we would love for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie, Head Injury, Immediate Surgery
Mike Organ reported in Tennessean that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was rushed into surgery on Saturday after suffering a head injury in a 31–27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the edge of the field and collapsed where he was," Reed said.
After the trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the fieldside, they put the footballer on a stretcher and took him to a detailed examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no detail about the type/degree of injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
He transferred from Abercrombie Illinois, his sophomore year at college, and his second season at Tennessee State.
A total of five steals before coming out of Saturday's game, he increased the number of steals in the season to 18.
UK will receive higher stamp tax than foreigners buying real estate
In England, a higher stamp tax will be taken from foreigners buying real estate, and this surplus will be used for homeless people within new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize Corbyn's success in his effort to attract young voters
Raising stamp tax will be taken from non-taxers in England
The Ministry of Finance predicts that £120 million a year will be collected to help the homeless
Theresa May today will announce that more stamp tax will be received from foreign buyers in the UK while buying real estate for use to help homeless people.
This move is seen as Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to nullify the success of his effort to procure more affordable homes by targeting high-income buyers.
The stamp tax increase will be provided from people and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, which will contribute to the Government's effort to fight homelessness.
This fee, which was added to the current stamp tax to include high taxes from the second homes and foreign estates received two years ago, can be found by three percent.
The Ministry of Finance predicts that the initiative will bring up to £120m per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the next generation of real estate in London has been taken by people outside the UK, which raises prices, making it difficult for the first time to buy real estate.
Because of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad, many wealthy areas in the country, especially areas in the capital, have become "ghost cities".
The new policy came up a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax discount so that more young people could have their first home.
Johnson accused major construction firms of putting them on the property early and then raising real estate prices by not using them, and invited May to remove quotas in affordable homes to remove this "real disgrace" in the UK.
Corbyn announced a number of notable housing reform proposals, including rent inspections, aimed at ending "absolutely based" evacuations.
He also wants councils to be given more authority to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime ministership to reviving the British dream, i.e. to making life even better for all generations to come.
This requires fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people to live here, to work and to live here.
However, it is not right for people and foreign-born firms who do not live in England to buy homes as easily here as hard-working British citizens.
It's been a very difficult dream for many to have a home, and a humiliating situation like homelessness is too real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to be Scotland's director."
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "biggest goal" was to coach Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish director enjoys the fight to revive the Northeast club, which ranks three points behind the summit in League One.
After taking St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season, he moved to Light Stadium this summer.
Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound, "I wanted to play football in my country.
I bought a baseball cap, that's all."
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father a lot when I was a kid, which has always drawn me to him.
But this opportunity only comes if I succeed in coaching."
Sunderland's coaches before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic, who had rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town in the past, said he was never shy of working behind radical names at such a large club.
"For me now success is measured only by the answer to the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?''.
According to the structure and possibilities at the club, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy getting up there, but the only way I can count myself successful here is probably to get the club up there."
Ross, who was an assistant coach for a period at Dumbarton and served 15 months on the Hearts' coaching staff, is only in his third year of coaching career.
Ross also saved Alloa from falling out of the league and placed her third in the league and turned St. Mirren from the brink of falling out, earning a Championship title the following season, raising him to a top cluster.
Ross now says he feels more comfortable than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real turning point," he said about his time at the head of Alloa.
"I really believe that coaching is the right choice for me rather than playing football.
It may sound strange because I play well, make reasonable sums, and have good times.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot of phases you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through the same thing in terms of work stress and pressure, but coaching makes me feel so good.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and right now I'm doing what I want, and I'm in the most comfortable place in my entire adult life.

Research revealed that the appropriate time for beer was 5:30.
In the summer, the burning heats increased the revenue of England's troubled bars, while the chain put more pressure on restaurants.
According to numeric data, sales of pubs and bar groups rose 2.7 percent in July, while the revenues of restaurants dropped 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who collected numeric data and became CGA financial adviser, said: "Continuous sunlight and Britain's longer rivalry than expected at the World Cup meant that July's pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, while restaurants progressed in a similar way to June, when they received a deep impact.
In June, the 1.8 per cent drop in the business volume of restaurants worsened in July.
Liquor-weight pubs and bars made by far the best performance by earning more than the income lost by restaurants with their counterparts.
In addition, food-weight pubs were not as serious as restaurant operators, but were damaged by temperatures.
People seem to only go out for drinks.
Drink sales rose 6.6 per cent this month as food sales fell by three per cent in the operated pubs and bars."
"These results remain the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of significant social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales in the non-house market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still suffering, although in addition to cost pressures of a 4.8 per cent drop in sales compared to the previous year, it is particularly frustrating.
The long and hot summer has found the worst possible time for food-heavy enterprises, and time will tell if the more temperate weather we see in August will provide even a little bit of needed relief."
The total sales increase of pubs and restaurants, including newcomers, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown on their brand debut.
The Coffee Peach Tracker industry sales tracking system of pubs, bars and restaurant sectors in England collects and analyzes data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than £9 billion. Coffee Peach, commonly known in the industry, is a comparative assessment firm.
One of the five children has a social media account that they keep a secret from their families.
One study revealed that one in five children who started at 11 years of age had social media accounts that they kept secret from their parents and teachers.
Research among 20,000 middle school students revealed the plus in "false Insta" accounts
This development has raised concerns about sexual sharing
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "mother" account to show their parents.
One of the children who starts at 11 is opening secret social media accounts from their adults.
Research among 20,000 middle school students revealed the increase in their accounts, the Instagram, a photo-sharing site "the fake Insta,".
This development has raised concerns that there have been sexual sharings.
Twenty percent of the students told their parents they had a show-off, clean "mother" accounts, as well as a private account.
A mother, who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, met a teenager who forced others to "rape" her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) in independent schools revealed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two accounts, of which half admitted to having private accounts.
"It's disturbing that so many young people tend to create Internet spaces where their families and teachers can't find them," HMC President Mike Buchanan said.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected as an independent member of the community's board at the annual general meeting of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle, Scotland's most decorated athlete and president Ian Beattie considered this development a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from the athlete's ten-year experience at the international level.
"Eilidh is greatly respected in Scotland, Great Britain and the world athletic community. Bringing him to the board of directors will contribute greatly to Scottish athletics," Beattie said.
"I am ready to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and direct Scottish sport," Doyle said.
In 1996, the American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres races at the Olympics in Atlanta, won four gold medals in total and is now an expert on the BBC, became unable to walk after his temporary ischemic attack.
The athlete wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke today a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that if I get better, if I get better, it'll be obvious in time.
It's been a rough ride, but I'm fully recovered, and I've learned to walk again, and today I'm practicing agility!
Thank you for your support messages!"
The breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows split the Internet in half
The breast pump company, which likened breast-feeding mothers to milked cows, split the Internet in half with its commercial.
Consumer technologies firm Elvie released a witty advertisement inspired by a music video to promote its product, which was said to be "the world's first wearable silent breast pump", to show the freedom the new pump knew to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance to a song in a barn full of hay with lyrics as follows: "Yes, I milk my own milk but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't cow tits, these are my boobs."
The chorus of the song is "Pompala, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, milk."
However, the advertising shared on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments have received mixed responses from viewers, many people have said that the video reveals "the horrors" of the milk industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows in the advertisement of this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth in order to reproduce, but their offspring are taken away from them a few days after they are born," he wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits perfectly into the breast-feeding bra.
Someone else wrote: "It's obviously traumatic in terms of both the mother and her cub.
But why shouldn't they be used to advertise breast pumps for mothers whose babies aren't taken away?
Another wrote, "It's a very disassociated commercial from the world."
Some defended the ad, and a woman said she found the song "very funny."
Someone said, "I think it's a very creative idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd take it from this pump.
Pumping milk really made me feel like a cow.
It's a bit of a freak commercial, but I got the message.
It's a very clever product," he wrote.
Another said, "This is mostly an ad for mothers who feel like cows when they're pumping milk in workplaces or toilets."
It's not an advertisement that praises or eats the milk industry."
At the end of the video, all the women are dancing with a breast pump attached to their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk feel like cows.
Elvie Pump, however, is completely silent, without cable, without tubes, and fits perfectly into the breast-feeding bra, thus giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, or even go out.
Ana Balarin, a joint and creative executive at Mother, said, "Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and provocative introduction.
We wanted to pump milk and bring out all the challenges of this process as it showed the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump would provide in a fun and insightful way by analogy between nursing mothers and milking cows.
This isn't the first time Elvie Pump's been on the agenda.
On London Fashion Week, a mother with two children went on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
Although the monthly border crossings did not change much, the number of illegal children immigrants rose rapidly, partly because of the Trump administration's strict speech and policies aimed at making it difficult to place children next to their sponsors.
Usually sponsors are people who are also illegal immigrants at the time, who are afraid to risk their own being able to stay in the country by having a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and adults at home had to issue fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration officials.
Senior Immigration and Customs Conservation officer Matthew Albence testified that the institution against Congress had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor underage children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
"About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or from the family of sponsors are found illegally in this country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
That's why we're not going to let these people go."
Sanctuary workers laid out new rules requiring officials to appear in court within a month instead of the standard 60 days after some were arrested to see the children's case faster.
Many will argue with the immigration judge in their legal cases instead of going to court in person.
Those who are not fit to be released will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the more detention the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety disorder and depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape.
Lawyers said these concerns increased in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where the possibility of the child's difficulty being ignored depends on the size.
They also stated that sending children to tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could trigger traumas many of which are already suffering.
Syria says American, French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Velid Al Muallim also called for Syrian refugees to return, although the war in the country was in its eighth year.
Muallim, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were found illegally on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "the matter will be done".
"They must withdraw immediately, without conditions," he told the board.
Muallim claimed that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions are more homeless.
He said Damascus would "continue this holy struggle from all lands in Syria until it clears both terror groups and all illegal foreign beings."
The United States has close to 2,000 military troops in Syria who train with Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs against Bashar Assad and provide intelligence to these troops.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war victim country.
In terms of refugees, Muallim said the conditions were convenient for them to return, and accused "some western countries" of spreading "displaced fears" that led refugees to stay away from the country.
"We have called for international communities and humanitarian aid agencies to provide returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what's supposed to be a human issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no development assistance for Syria until a political agreement is made between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats told Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold between Russia and Turkey, that the agreement to create a buffer zone created the opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement has prevented Russian-backed Syrian forces from launching a massive attack in the region of three million people.
However, Muallim stressed that the agreement was "net final validity dates" and expressed hope that the military action targeting jihadists, including fighters on the Al-Qaeda-related Nusra Front, would be "moved out of the middle".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura wants to organise the first meetings of a new board of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallim proposed conditions for the Syrian government to join the board, and warned against interventions, saying that the function of the panel should be limited to "examining the clauses of the current constitution".
Why Trump Will Win Second Round Election
According to this logic, Trump will win the new election in 2020 unless liberal audiences possibly misuse the post as he had hoped and lead to the early end of the scandal presidency.
That would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic ending of all time for the presidency!"
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
In gold hours since 2014, CNN's rating doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's rating tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 1.7 million viewers four years ago in gold hours, now at an average of 2.4 million, leading on cable channels with 3.5 million viewers on the main news nights of "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", describing a minister who became president after the congressional building was destroyed by an attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He remembers an incident in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told Scovell he was gonna vote for Trump.
The writer asked, "Why?"
"Because it makes me laugh," said the driver.
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, plots from Washington can determine Roe v. Wade's future, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the state of the global economy.
Staying away from the agenda is a luxury that only very privileged viewers can afford.
However, when experts use Bob Woodward's "detailed information" as a method of sourced in the "Fear" book on the panel, it goes beyond being a learned citizen when you find Paul Manafort's boomer jacket from $15,000 ostrich skin (a sort of arrogant suit according to the Washington Post's definition) and Stormy Daniels' discussion of Trump's, well, herpes depiction of his anatomy for six hours.
I personally can't look at Super Mario the same way again.
Brent Montgomery, general manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", said of Trump's program's changing team and daily changing issues (not getting into fights with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un...) "What makes the program look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night."
You can't afford to miss a chapter or you'll be left behind.

The foreign money flows into the most difficult by-election the White House has ever contested.
It is not surprising that he saw cash flow in Pennsylvania's 17th district as a result of a vote shift that put two officials in the same position into the race for the same position.
The newly held Pittsburg suburban district puts Democratic MP Conor Lamb in the race, who participated in last spring's election in another region.
Lamb is competing against another island, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents his 12th district, which largely overlaps with Pennsylvania's new 17th district.
Maps were redrawed in January as the Supreme Court ruled that the former territories were unconstitutionally set in accordance with the interests of Republicans.
The race main party funding tributaries in the new 17th district were the scene of an electoral campaign funding race that broke between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Commission (the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee [DCC] and the National Republican Campaign Commission (the National Republican Campaign Committee [NRC]).
Lamb became a recognized name for Pennsylvania's 18th District after winning the special election in March, followed by many people, by a narrow margin.
There had been a Republican in this post for more than a decade, and President Trump had won the area by 20 points.
Political experts provoked the Democrats a little.
U.S. Considers Punishing El Salvador on Support for China and Then Gives Up
Diplomats stated that the Dominican Republic and Panama already knew Beijing and drew some reaction from Washington.
Trump had an intimate meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until partners evacuated the Trump Organization's administrative team.
State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said earlier this month that ministry officials had decided to recall diplomatic incumbent American officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of the "decided not to recognise newly received Taiwan".
But the sanctions were only intended to be applied to El Salvador, who received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017 for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The sanctions covering financial aid cuts and targeting visa restrictions would be devastating for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As meetings continued at the ministry, North American and Central American officials postponed the senior conference on security and economic development, which was a continuation of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as an improvement in efforts to prevent immigrants from turning towards the United States.
But until mid-September, senior executives said they wanted the conference to move forward, and they didn't leave any sanction bills for El Salvador.
The diplomats said that Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to speak at the mid-October conference as a sign of the importance the administration gave to the meeting.
Three American representatives calmly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House Spokesperson for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate, described by three American officials, who were two diplomats and agreed to conduct internal negotiations under the condition of secrecy.
These officials' statements were supported by an analyst outside the Palace, who was close to the administration and spoke on the condition of secrecy.

Another expected development could be special prosecutor Robert Mueller writing a report on Trump's possibility of obstructing justice with highly supportive evidence in the archives.
Mueller's research was reported to be directed to whether Trump's election campaign was linked to Russia's attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will once again find himself forced to answer in this community as a jury of his colleagues prepares to appear in front of the voters, or even ultimately his colleagues.
There are many possibilities, and I do not claim that Trump or his European counterparts are inevitable.
There are choices for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic to determine how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, if the West had resisted Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich, German officers would have been ready to strike.
We failed and failed to prevent years of bloodshed.
History is shaped around such landmarks, and the unstoppable progression of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now living with a few of these landmarks.
What do we do if Mr. Trump dismiss Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has faced serious problems since the document, which claims he secretly suggested recording the president's talks and revealed rumors that the president was unfit for office, appeared last year.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times' statements are not true.
"How do we respond if Brett Kavanaugh, recently requested from the FBI, is found not guilty in the Supreme Court, although the investigation is not carried out extensively and fairly or has serious charges of sexual assault and perjury?
Aside from all that, we're voting for a House that will hold Mr. Trump responsible in the by-election?
If we don't pass these exams, democracy will have a difficult process.
But I don't believe we'll fail because I learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was once sent to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied my embassy home.
He got out of there alive, emigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table with a swastika on it.
How can I be hopeless about our future when I have such a past?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, hopeful after Rapid Vienna collision
Following their impressive draw with Villarreal at the beginning of this month in Spain, the Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna in the field this Thursday and will have a strong advantage to advance from the Group G of the European League if they leave their match with the Austrian team with a win.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans was not in the field during the season, due to a knee injury, until the 2–2 game with Villarreal, but according to the player, this could be used as a jumping board to bigger jobs for the team.
"For us, this was a good point because Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old player.
"We went to the game believing that we could have a good result and left with one point.
Maybe we could have had a better result, but the tie was probably a fairer one.
In the first half they were probably better than us, but in the second half we came forward and played better.
It's coming up on Thursday, and there's gonna be another big European night.
We hope we get three more points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they got a good result from their last game, but I'm sure we can force them to do something positive with the audience behind us.
With my injuries and the changes the club's been through last year, it's been really hard, but I think our current position is very good.
Our team is fine, and everyone's really enjoying it; the training is going well.
I hope we go on like this and leave the last season behind and succeed."
Women fall asleep in fear of pension savings
Although participants in the study had clear ideas about how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their families about it.
Almost half of the individuals under Nationwide's research have spoken to their wives about long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they are not taking any steps to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
You can start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not tell them what you want, you cannot prepare your family for how they will look after you in the future.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want care, for these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Talk to your financial adviser: Your consultant can provide you with a solution to cover these costs.
As long as you have a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a mixed cash-supply life insurance policy or money that will help you cover expenses, insuranceing your own fortune may be one of your payment options for long-term care.
Complete legal documents: Resolve legal problems.
You get a health proxy, so you can choose someone you trust to run your health care, and you can guarantee that when you can't communicate, the employees will comply with your wishes.
Also, see if you can find a deputy to run your financial affairs.
You also want to make sure that your bills are paid when someone you trust makes your financial decisions and you cannot.

Police have announced that the incident, which took place at 2:30 p.m. with the British Summer Hour, was "a random act".
The victim said he didn't see his attacker.
There is no fatal injury, and the police are gathering testimony from witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis occurred in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in Palu, Indonesia due to a severe earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communications channels, aid workers have yet to hear from Donggala's regency, the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake in northern Palu.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western shore of the island of Sulawesi and is estimated to have a population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regent with a length of over 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative district under a province, is estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main livelihoods of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the economy of the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining in the province is also important, but mining is concentrated in Morowali on the opposite bank of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Anti-fatal Agency, there have been several tsunami disasters in Palu and Donggala over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes while killing over 200 people in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami killed nine people in Donggala.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and experiences earthquakes regularly.
Here are some serious earthquakes and tsunami disasters in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province in North Sumatra, Indonesia caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing more than half of the 226,000 people found in Aceh.
2005: Severe earthquakes in late March and early April hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds were killed on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The magnitude 6.8 earthquake that struck Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggered a tsunami, prompting it to hit the southern coast of the island and killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake off the coast of Sumatra struck one of the Mentawai islands, causing a tsunami approaching 10 metres, and dozens of villages were destroyed as a result of the disaster, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake in Aceh's Pidie Jaya regency caused destruction and panic by bringing the fatal damage to the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 people were killed due to collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes on Indonesia's tourist island led to 500 deaths, most of which were located north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and trapped thousands of tourists on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault crimes.
According to a Alaska State Police report released on Saturday, Wasilla, 29-year-old Palin of Alaska was arrested for domestic violence, interfering with a report on domestic violence, and resisting charges against police.
According to the police report, he took the phone of a woman who tried to call the police in an attempt to report the charges mentioned.
According to the KTUU statement, Palin is currently being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with an unsecured bond of $500.
According to the statement, he testified that he was "absolutely innocent" when he was asked to plead in his court on Saturday.
Palin faces three different Class A misdemeanor charges, and may therefore be fined up to a year in prison and $250,000 in fines.
He also has a Class B charge against him, resulting in a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't Palin's first criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, had called the police to report the alleged attack.
Right now, the Alaska Supreme Court is looking at the case.
In January 2016, he had faced charges of domestic violence, interfering with a report on domestic violence, and possession of weapons while under substance influence in connection with the same incident.
His girlfriend claimed Palin punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin had been criticized by veterans in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his services in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami, resulting in thousands of homes being destroyed.
Power and communications channels are currently unavailable, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in the centre of Sulawesi, which remained northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia.
Videos showing the moment of disaster are shared in social media circles.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors want the death penalty rarely carried out for NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York City are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York City, which has rarely been carried out for any federal crime in the city since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov allegedly hired a truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway in October and ran over pedestrians and cyclists who came up against him.
In an attempt to justify the death penalty, prosecutors need to prove that Saipov "knowingly" killed eight victims and "knowingly" did serious physical damage to people, according to the intent document reported in the Southern District of New York, stating that he was asked for the death penalty.
According to court documents, both crimes bring a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a major federal jury slapped Saipov with a 22-point indictment involving a charge of violence, destruction of motor vehicles, and eight counts of blackmail charges, which are often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime.
Prosecutors said the attack would require "majorly premeditated planning", saying Saipov's action was "tiny, ruthless, immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury and damage; Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco were strangled by the law," the report says.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has been sentenced to death for ten years.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was charged with the murder of two drug suppliers, but as a result he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In a federal case in New York City, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were last sentenced to death in 1953, when the married couple were accused of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago and were executed.
Rosenberg was executed on June 19, 1953, when the couple were placed in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov of Uzbekistan showed no signs of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
According to police testimony, he told investigators that he felt good about what he was doing.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired by an ISIS video he was watching on his phone to carry out the attack.
According to police testimony, he even wanted to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He said he didn't plead guilty to crimes in a 22-point indictment.
David Patton, a federal defense officer representing Saipov, said the decision was "of course sad".
"We think the decision by the accused to be sentenced to death rather than sentence him to life without being released will further prolong the trauma to all those involved in the incident," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP said NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage swore today during a Tory conference that he would "move the people's army into action".
Theresa May, one of her own lawmakers, said she should take charge of negotiations with the EU, while the former Ukip leader said politicians should feel pressure from opponents of the European Union.
Conservative dissident MP Peter Bone said in the march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have been out by now" if it hadn't been for Mr. Farage Brexit Secretary.
Another anti-Brexit march in the city was highlighted by the pro-EU Torys as having trouble reconciled Ms May's well-separated party members.
He is having problems with ensuring that party members continue the plan, among the Brexit supporters, the EU sides, and the attacks from the EU itself.
They insist that the Allies continue its effort to deal with Brussels despite incoming reactions and force the EU opposition and Labour to choose between the plan presented and the "chaos".
Mr Bone said during the Leave Means Leave walk in Solihull he wanted to "vacuate the Chequers Housing".
He said Mr Farage should be involved in talks with Brussels and take responsibility.
"If he were responsible for these talks, we would have left the EU by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I'll make an effort for Brexit, but we have to evacuate Chequers."
"We did not give the world wars to become servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone denied allegations that the public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The thoughts of the British people had changed their minds and wanted to remain in the EU are completely unfounded."
Andrea Jenkyns, pro-Brexit and Tory, were also on the march and spoke to reporters, "I'm just saying, Mr. Prime Minister, listen to the public."
"Chequers are not loved by the public, the opposition will not get the vote, they are not loved by our party and our activists who have led us to the streets and get elected.
Please let Chequers go and open your ears."
He added to his message targeting Miss May: "If the Prime Ministers do not keep their promises, they cannot hold their positions."
Mr Farage said in the march that politicians should "feel the pressure" on them when they consider betraying the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us and the people and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say, 'We're not gonna let you do this.'"
In his message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to make our politicians feel the pressure on the brink of betraying Brexit."
"We are trying to mobilize the people's army of this country, which has enabled us to achieve victory in Brexit, we will not stop until we become an independent, self-management and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, EU extremists held a two-hour rally downtown after their march within the city of Birmingham.
After the band's entrance this weekend, a group of activists waved flags "Torys vs. Brexit".
Labour member Lord Adonis criticised the Conservatives for their patronage of a party practice as the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use all the technology for IT systems and for smooth borders for Canada and for unlimited free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a disgrace.
There is no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to do a "deep review" on running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the November election, she planned to "make a thorough review of becoming a presidential candidate".
The Boston Globe reports that a member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke Saturday about plans for the future at a city hall in western Massachusetts.
Frequently critical of president Donald Trump, Warren will compete in the November election against Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign co-chair, Republican Party State Representative Geoff Diehl.
There were rumors that Warren might run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was Warren's 36th meeting with participating voters in the city hall setting since Trump took office.
A participant asked him if he was running for president.
Warren replied that "it is time for women to go to Washington to fix the corrupt government, and this includes the involvement of a woman at the top of the state."
One person from LSU was arrested for the shooting and killing of Sims.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police have announced the arrest of a suspect in connection with the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Saturday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in connection with the incident at a press conference held at 11:00 Eastern Time.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday had asked citizens to help identify a man in the footage.
Sims, 20, had been shot and killed early Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims appears to have been shot in the head and died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press, 247sports reported on Saturday.
Wayde reportedly intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson admitted to being at the scene in his interrogation, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in the East Baton Rouge Neighborhood Police Department.
Sims, a boy who grew up in Baton Rouge and was 6 fut 6 inches tall, averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds in a total of 32 games in the top 5 last season 10.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton runs for world title after leaving Sebastian Vettel behind on team orders
On Saturday's race, it was revealed that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race from the moment Valtteri Bottas got ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
Bottas got off to a good start from pole position, keeping his position in the first two rounds, forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel, who first entered the pit stop, then left Hamilton behind, which could have been the move that ended the race.
Entering the pit stop in the next round, the Mercedes team came behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead by forcing the Ferrari driver to make a defensive close move on the third turn, allowing him to leave the interior unintentionally.
Max Verstappen, who started the race in the back row and celebrated his 21st birthday, managed to make it seventh at the end of the first round.
He then led much of the race at the expense of burning his tyres to cross Kimi Raikkonen in the fourth row, aiming for a quick finish.
Verstappen entered the pit stop in lap 44 but failed to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen did not lose fourth place.
Hamilton said, "It's been a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two rows," he said.
The Body Language Was Really Bad
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who said at Saturday's rally that Christine Blasey Ford had not leaked the letter accusing Constitutional Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said that thanks to what happened in the Senate, people were seen to be "bad and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that's happened in the Senate in the last few days is that we see angry, angry, bad, and dishonest people," Trump said.
You're looking at published and leaked information, but they're like, "I didn't do it.
It wasn't me."
"Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak information?
And don't forget the woman's answer.
Nope.
I didn't leak it."
Wait a minute.
We leaked it, we didn't leak it," Trump did.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford in July containing details of allegations of sexual harassment against Kavanaugh, the letter had been leaked to the press in September, but Feinstein had denied that his office was the source of this leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"Doctor Fort asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret as he asked."
Yet this denial, according to what he said at his Saturday night rally, did not satisfy the president: "I'll tell you what, the body language was really bad.
Maybe not, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president, who went on to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexually abusing them, suggested the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They're determined to try anything to regain power."
"You see what evil they do to gain power and control, they don't care who they hurt or who they crush," Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars won the 5–3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday, making up for Friday's Elite League defeat.
The Giants led two zeros at the start of the game with goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a draw, but Dwyer's goal put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored the scoring again for Dundee, but Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals determined the result of the match.
The game in Belfast was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's students, who had beaten Dundee 2–1 by passing through again after losing on Friday.
This was the fourth match of the two teams this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came at 03:35, in the fourth minute of the game from Kendall McFaull's assist, and four minutes later, Beauvillier with David Rutherford's assist doubled the gap.
In the first period of intense, Sullivan scored the home team's goal at 13:10, followed by Matt Marquardt scoring Cownie's equalizing the score at 15:16.
Dwyer scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period, allowing the Giants to take the lead at halftime.
The home team pulled themselves together and Bouchard's goal at 27:37 again tied the score.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to allow Nielsen to take the lead for the first time against Dundee at the end of the second period and scored the final goal in the final period.
The Giants, who lost four out of the last five games, will host Milton Keynes on his own field next Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Died To Make Hundreds of Passengers On Plane Escape From Earthquake
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller is credited as a hero after he lost his life while ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off the runway.
More than 800 people were killed in a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which then triggered a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks continue in the area, and a lot of people are still waiting to be rescued under debris in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their own lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport's control tower, which shook wildly in the earthquake.
He remained in the tower to make sure Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, was safely airborne.
Then he jumped out of the tower thinking the traffic control tower had collapsed.
He later died in the hospital where he was removed.
Air Navigation Indonesian spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
"We have prepared a helicopter to transport our workstone from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city."
"But unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu."
"It was very sad to hear this news," Sirait added.
Meanwhile, the country's disaster-fighting agency said access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited. Officials are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands.
"We think the death toll could increase because there are still many people under the wreckage," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the institution.
Waves reaching up to six metres devastated Palu, a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting medical aid and needed supplies to the area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, spoke to Sky News: "An ambulance brings in new bodies every minute.
Clean water is very hard to find.
Minimarts are looting everywhere."
International Red Cross Indonesian President Jan Gelfand told CNN: "As the Indonesian Red Cross, we are racing through time to help survivors, but we don't know what to expect there.
This is already a great tragedy, but the situation could get worse."
In CNN's report, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and called out to the army: "I want you to work day and night to complete all duties related to the ban.
Are you ready to do this?"
Indonesia had also been shaken by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports a man missing after plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline, which operated the plane which crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, announced that 47 passengers and crew had safely exited the sinking aircraft, but one person was missing.
Air Niugini has stated that as of Saturday afternoon, a male passenger has not been found.
The airline reported that it was working jointly with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find this passenger.
The airline has yet to answer further information about the passenger, such as the passenger's age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue other passengers and crew on the plane that crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said seven people were hospitalized on Friday.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were being kept under observation at the hospital and that their condition was stable.
The cause of the accident and how it happened in order remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claimed that the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane approached the runway too low.
"That's an extremely good thing," Jaynes added.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to make their way to the emergency exits of the plane that sank into the water that had reached the waist level.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working to improve a nearby pier were helping rescue operations using an inflatable boat for people to move ashore before the aircraft sank into a depth of about 30 metres (100 fut) in water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in accidents in PNG registered airlines over the past 20 years, but Air Niugini has no history of an accident.
The analyst revealed the time stream of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution presented their evidence Saturday at the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
The analyst told the jury how the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers combined their movements the night of his death.
Clarion Ledger reported that Rowlett had received location information from his cell phones to show Tellis was with Chambers the night of the woman's death.
The data went to talk to Sanford when Tellis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford when the police showed that his cell phone was at the same location as Chambers'.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors reminded Tellis of his testimony that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford continued, "The defendant is lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was Tellis saying he had known Chambers for nearly two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He's wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defendant is scheduled to begin closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said the case was expected to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
This hip hop trio wants to change the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol debut The High Breed claims that hip hop has distanced itself from the origins of political messages and deals with social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently become popular again in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York nanny sues for a double "racist" message she's working with.
A New York nanny is suing him for discrimination and firing him after a message written by the child's mother that accidentally sent him, writing "one more black."
The couple deny they're being racist and make the case look like a rip-off.
Two children's mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, stated her discomfort when new childcare provider Giselle Maurice found out she was black on her first day in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman sent a message to her husband saying, "No, no, no, no, no.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
The New York Post reported that Plasco-Flaxman fired African-American Miss Maurice as "uncomfortable" after realizing the gaffe she had made, saying that the nanny had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Miss Maurice was paid for a day and then sent home in an Uber vehicle.
Maurice sues the couple and asks for firing compensation, and $350 a day for the six months he was hired without a contract and works at home.
"I want to show them that they can't do things like this," she told the Post on Friday.
The couple respond to their claims that they are racist, stating that it makes sense to end Maurice's business because they are afraid that after offending him, they won't be able to trust him.
Speaking to the Post, her husband Joel Plasco said, "My wife sent her something she didn't actually mean.
He's not a racist.
"We're not racist people," he says.
"But will you hand your children over to someone you've been rude to even by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Don't do it."
Plasco, who considers the case an "triggering" effort, adds that the baby was only born two months ago and that his wife was "in a very difficult situation".
He says, "You're gonna sue someone like that?"
"That's not very nice," he adds, investment expert.
The legal process is still under way, but social media is being swept away by their double behavior and logic in public.
A new letter shows Paddington publishers afraid readers will not be able to relate to a talking bear.
Born shortly after Bond's book was accepted, Karen Jankel said of the letter: "It is very difficult to replace someone who reads for the first time before it was published.
It's fun to see what we know now about Paddington's great success."
Jankel, who worked as a BBC cameraman before inspiration came from the mouth of a small teddy bear to write a children's book, said he was optimistic about the possibility of his work being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books after his father's death last year was "both bitter and sweet".
From Paddington, whom he described as a "very important member of our family", he also stated that his father was quietly proud of his success at the end of the book.
"My father was a very quiet man and he was not a boaster of his actions," he said.
"But since Paddington is so real to him, you feel like you have a child who accomplishes something, and even if it's not your success, you're proud of it.
I think that's how my father saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his invention and dream, he always gave Paddington his due."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the landing, his daughter Nice's Hospital was removed to Louis Pasteur 2 and doctors tried to save the woman's life, but were unsuccessful.
"Nad regularly called me and said that she was really bad and that she wasn't expected to live," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey."
"We'll be together again soon."
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep pumping blood slowly wore off and left her body.
He died a while ago, and now it was over.
I knew what was going to happen, and I just had to sit back and wait.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was in a place with family members and a lot of people.
I really had to hold back."
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her daughter, has finally boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of her difficulties.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and tears poured out of my eyes.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a great deal of sympathy for Nad during the flight.
I felt he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Women who lose loved ones put cards on the bridge to prevent suicides.
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are trying to stop others from ending their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been pasting cards on the Welsh Bridge with phone numbers from people who can be called for inspirational messages and support for some time.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler began fighting depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I do every day," Davis says.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son is a promising cook who makes everyone around her smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They used to say that her smile spreads joy."
But he quit his job because he was "in a very bad time" before his death.
In 2014, the first person to realize that Tyler had ended his own life was his brother, who was then 11 years old.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly concerned that the chain will have an effect."
He says that the reason Miss Davis made the cards is to "make people realize that there are people you can go and talk to all the time, even if it's a friend."
"Keep quiet, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davis's for many years, lost his wife Mark of 15 years shortly after her mother's death.
"He never told me he was unhappy or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day was extremely bad, the kids didn't even make eye contact with them when they opened their gift packs."
He said that his wife's death was a major trauma to the whole family, but they should get over it: "It makes a hole in the heart of the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to go on and fight."
If you find it difficult to fight, you can call Samaritans free of charge via 116 123 (United Kingdom and Ireland), e-mail to jo@samaritans.org, or visit Samaritans' website here.
Brett Kavanaugh's fate will be determined by the FBI's investigation.
"I think that if an investigation had been conducted in a limited and time-consuming manner as he wanted, we could have reached an agreement," Mr Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee, which had hit a dead end due to partisanship, would have been "disintegrated".
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his own Republican supporters ask him to do an FBI investigation?
The whole reason for their reluctance is timing.
The by-elections are only five weeks away, and if Republicans do a bad job as expected of them on November 6, efforts to ensure that the person they want is elected to the highest court in the country will suffer serious damage.
George W. Bush had been making phone calls with Senators for some time, lobbying them to support his current wife, Mr. Kavanaugh, who had been working for him at the White House in the past, allowing him to meet his former personal secretary, Ashley.
What happens after the FBI reports?
A vote will now take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats fill their seats.
It is currently unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will reach 50 votes in the Senate, if he can, Vice President Mike Pence may accept himself to the Supreme Court by breaking the tie.
In Kim's administration, the number of escapees from North Korea "falls"
According to statements from a South Korean lawmaker, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea declined after Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Pointing to information from the South's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug said the number of asylum seekers, 2,706 in 2011, dropped to 1,127 last year.
Mr Park stated that tightened border controls between North Korea and China and that human traffickers demand greater wages were the most important factors.
Pyongyang has made no statement.
The vast majority of asylum seekers fleeing the North are offered the opportunity for South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally from the Korean War, which ended in 1953.
Many of them are fleeing the country through China, which has the longest borders with North Korea, allowing for an easier transition from the Demilitarized Zone (SB), which is heavily protected between the two Koreas.
China views fugitives as illegal immigrants rather than asylum seekers, often returning them to their countries.
Relations between the North and South, technically still at war, have improved greatly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the pending nuclear disarmament.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting that US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula in June.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticised the United States for not making enough progress on sanctions since.
"If we can't trust the United States, we can't risk our national security, and under these circumstances it's impossible for us to do a unilateral disarmament first," Mr Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not nervously eligible to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this statement in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
For Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Pelosi said, "If a woman had done the same, I cannot ignore the fact that people would have said 'hysterical'."
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was quite emotional, almost shouting from time to time when talking about his family and high school years, and sometimes unable to speak.
He also publicly cursed the Democrats on the committee, considered the charges against him to be a "disgusting and planned character assassination" organized by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton losing in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony was proof that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because this statement showed that he himself was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think with these statements and his attitude towards the Clintons and Democrats, he reveals his own inadequacy," he said.
Kavanaugh is elected and the Democrats hesitated to respond to Pelosi, asked if he would contest the Supreme Court if he provided a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this; if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, aside from serving in the Supreme Court, he's not even fit to be in court where he is now," he said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that Kavanaugh was concerned as a Democrat because he himself was seen as a conservative judge about the Economic Health Care Act or potential provisions he would make against Roe v. Wade.
In the admissions hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether to change specific Supreme Court decisions.
"A hysteric, prejudiced person shouldn't expect us to go to court and say, 'Isn't that great?'" Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
A just criticism, even if it's the rage of months and years, can't say it without crying.
45 years later, Mrs. Steinem said to me, "We'll cry when we get angry."
"That's not uncommon, is it?"
She continued, "A woman who was a manager somewhere had helped me a lot, and she would cry when she got angry, but she developed a technique and when she started crying, you might think to the person she was talking to with this technique, 'I'm sorry I cried.
I'm angry.'
And then it went on.
I think that's very clever."
Partly due to misunderstanding, tears appear as an expression of anger.
I remember very well from one of my early jobs; I was crying incredibly furiously in an office with a majority of men, a woman of older age, a cold manager I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and pulled me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They won't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry and they'll be happy because they think they can impress you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congressman at the time, worked with him during Gary Hart's running for president.
When Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business in 1987 and withdrew from the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was extremely surprised, realized that there was no obstacle to her discovering the idea of running for president for her.
"It wasn't much of a thought," he says, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
'The Cotton Princess and the Seven Dwarfs,' said someone."
He was behind in finding funds because he started his campaign late and swore he would not enter the race until he raised $2 million.
It was a lost war.
He realized that some of his supporters, who gave men $1,000, had only given him $250.
He wondered, "Do they think I've been given a discount?"
While making a speech that he announced that he would not launch an official campaign, his throat was so filled with feelings such as frustration and anger caused by sexism that made it so difficult to find gratitude, money, and target voters rather than delegates.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown," said Mrs. Schroeder when she remembered the press reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
'He would cry'?"
How can the U.S.-Chinese trade war benefit Beijing?
The first shots of the trade war between the United States and China were very severe, while the war is far from over, but the openness between the countries can be beneficial to Beijing, according to experts in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by bringing additional tax to China's most important export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most notable tension came this week, with additional customs tax on some products worth a total of $200 billion (150 billion), and, in other words, taxing half of the products entering the United States from China.
Beijing responded more politely each time, while the last time it raised five percent customs taxes on American products, worth $60 billion, to ten percent.
China has promised to respond to the United States at the same power, and it seems unlikely that the world's second largest economy will give up anytime soon.
Responsibility to Washington requires the demands to be met, but it would be too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping to simply submit to the United States.
Nevertheless, experts say that if China plays its cards right, it can be positively affected in the long run by pressures in the trade war with the United States by reducing the interconnection of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could cause economic turmoil in one of the two countries is far more dangerous than those following the developments had previously anticipated," said Abigail Grace, a researcher at a new American Safety Center.
Foreign Minister said "Syrian 'ready' for asylum seekers' return"
Syria says it is ready for the asylum seekers' voluntary return and seeks help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country has improved.
"The ground is stronger now thanks to the fight against terrorism, and our lands are safer," he said.
The government is continuing the rehabilitation process to normalise areas destroyed by terrorists.
Due to unilateral economic measures and terrorism targeting their daily lives and livelihoods, there are all conditions for immigrants to voluntarily return to their countries where they are forced to leave.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country due to the war that began in 2011.
As many as six million people still live in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime was open to future aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid and aid from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe embraces Ryder Cup win in Paris
With 16.5 against the European Team 10.5, Paris won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. Team at Le Golf National outside France.
With this loss, the United States suffered its sixth consecutive loss in Europe, and has never won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Danish captain Thomas Bjorn regained the European crown as his team received the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled hard for most of the tournament, hit the water in the par-3 16th hole, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all rounds and was one of four players advancing 5-0-0 from the start of the tournament's current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest ranking player on the European team.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest ranking player, won 2–1 against British Ian Poulter, who was likely never to enter the Ryder Cup again.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, who had participated in the Ryder Cup eight times, was the top winner of all time in Europe with a career score of 25.5.
"I don't normally cry, but I can't stand it today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm very, very happy to have the trophy back.
Something about this team, and I'm very happy to be able to help," Garcia said after the European win.
He hands over the torch to his countryman John Ram, who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in Sunday's single games.
"I have the incredible pride of watching over the Tiger Woods I grew up watching," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a 13–21–3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who came first after Jack Nicklaus with 14 major titles he received.
The entire U.S. team, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament, struggled to find free passage all weekend.
After a performance that was disappointing for his team, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
We swept Europe this morning.
We fought back.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Each of his 12 players played very well.
We're gonna regroup the team, work with the PGA and Ryder Cup Committee in America, and we're gonna keep moving forward.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
They played better than us."
Red Tide News: Groups in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota are shrinking
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Natural Life Commission (FWC) shows a general reduction in Red Tidal groups in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, unsuitable proliferation conditions are reported from the regions of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which explains the shrinking groups.
During a proliferation period, the Red tide expands from the North Pinellas to the South Lee area about 130 miles.
Smaller groups can be found about 10 miles off the Hillsborough District, but they are less numerous than last week.
The Red tide was also observed in the Pasco Region.
Last week, medium-sized groups were observed off the coast and off the coast of the Pinellas District, small and large groups off the coast of the Hillsborough District, certain uncertain and large groups in the Manatee Region, certain uncertain and large groups off the coast and off the coast of the Sarasota Region, certain uncertain and medium-sized groups in the Charlotte Region, certain uncertain and large groups off the coast and off the coast of the Lee District, and small groups in the Collier Region.
Respiratory disturbances continue to be reported from the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier areas.
We haven't heard from respiratory distress in northwest Florida last week.
