28-year-old Cook Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
The 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
However, the victim's brother stated that he didn't think he could have been someone who might have wanted to hurt him, saying, "In the end, things were going well for him."
The San Francisco Coroner's Office announced Wednesday morning that the body found at the Westfield Mall was determined to belong to San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, 28.
The San Francisco Police Department has reported that the cause of death has been determined to be murder and that the investigations are ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously been working as kitchen department chief in Boston, had begun working as a San Francisco Sons & Daughters kitchen section chief, getting the job of his dreams six months earlier.
Sons & Daughters official stated that this death "surprised them and they were extremely upset".
"We are a small team working here like a tight family, and he will be missed very much," the spokesman said.
At this difficult time, we would like to point out to Frank's family that they are not alone and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank was initially staying at the hostels and said, "In the end, things were going well for him."
Louis Galicia told the KGO, "He had an apartment and he was dating a girl."
Louis Galicia said he didn't think there might be anyone who might want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
The way to bond with the family was always to prepare a plate for us, to cook for us," said Louis Galicia.
He didn't like to argue.
My brother, he'd fit in.
He said, "As everything else in the world went wrong, it was that uncut diamond that sparkled every day."
Persons with information have been asked to call the SFPD Intelligence Line on telephone 415-575-4444.
Assistant doctors on strike: calls for new job slowdown
Representatives of assistant doctors asked their unions to allow them to slow down work in connection with the dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Assistant Doctors Committee (JDC) called on the general council to support further work slowing action from the beginning of September.
The JDC expressed that ministers could not address concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted no in the contract agreement with the BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the voting members.
In an article posted on Twitter Thursday night, JDC president Ellen McCourt stated that the government was "silently silent" about the problems that caused the contract to be rejected.
"In light of this, the JDC Board voted to reject the proposed new contract entirely and called for a re-establishment of formal negotiations on concerns," he said.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC administration made an official request that the BMA Board allow a programme to increase business slowdown from the beginning of September.
The dispute caused resident doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first total cut in NHS history.
Dr. Johann Malawana, assistant doctor leader at the BMA, resigned after a vote was cast against the terms of the contract proposed by the BMA.
During meetings before 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students voted, BMA had told its members that this was a good deal to accept.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt stated that the contract would be put into practice to be valid for doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: An 'illegal alliance'?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russia and Turkey's leaders met on Tuesday to announce the official end of the eight-month war on handshakes and words and economic sanctions.
However, while Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the flamboyant hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I was under the impression that Ankara was the one who wanted the compromise most.
Shake hands, yeah.
However, Mr. Putin's smile was rather weak, and his own limited standards could not be said to have spread any heat, even against it.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly mentioned his "good friend" Mr. Putin; five times according to one report.
I've lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to the pre-crisis level, but would reach far higher levels.
The next day, a newspaper here said Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his excitement was the opposite.
However, Mr. Putin's cold impression of the environment showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his statement at the opening was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
At the time, Russia's reaction was furious.
Mr Putin made a tough exit, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The resentment was much greater, thought to be friends with the other side.
It will be difficult to rebuild trust literally, perhaps impossible.
Since November, Russia's people have also changed their minds.
The state-controlled media targeted Ankara for months in a traumatic and aggressive manner.
Suddenly, the Turks are to blame for everything.
The most serious of these were accusations that senior officials had profited from the illegal oil trade carried out in areas under the control of Mr. Erdogan's family, the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
He has firmly denied it.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
In the end, the reason this meeting took place was because Mr. Putin had received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia might see it as some kind of victory.
The benefits of calling for a ceasefire for Ankara are clear.
First, Erdogan needs friends after a failed coup last month that almost brought him down.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey also affected him considerably.
Economic reasons are also effective.
Russia's sanctions have hit hard; especially the ban on special flights carrying several million Russian tourists to Turkey's coastal areas each year.
That number has dropped by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and rental companies were certainly relieved that flights would continue.
They rely on the end of the season intensity in the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicted a reduction in prices of fruit and vegetables by allowing Turkish agricultural products to re-enter.
To quote a story in the Vedemosti newspaper, "Tourists there, tomatoes here."
However, the visit also had a separate political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for not finding enough response to the coup attempt.
Mr Putin, who wants to benefit from Turkey's disassociation of ties with the West and its coldness, is added to his long-standing anger over the progress of talks on joining the United States at snail speed.
The Russian leader certainly seems to have gained sympathy from Ankara for calling for the support of elected officials following the coup attempt.
Remember, this was an inevitable attitude for Moscow, who himself had a deep fear of regime change.
This summit, held at this spectacular seaside palace, represents an "insubordinate alliance", as an analyst of Russia and Turkey explained to me: The two countries the West rejects and mistreats join forces.
Nevertheless, despite this display of compromise, they are quite different from each other.
One of the most important is about Syria: Russia and Turkey support different entities, although Moscow portrays itself as a mediator.
After almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that the issue was not addressed.
Turkey's President explicitly avoided answering a question about these differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on how to establish common ground in Syria.
However, after months of clear hostility -- and given the absolute catastrophic potential of NATO member Turkey hitting and dropping the Russian fighter -- it is certainly a good development for the two leaders to at least start talking.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside Scotland.
According to the president of the bank executive board, the RBS brand will move to the rear office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be destroyed for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was associated with the bank's global goals.
Eight years ago, he almost went under, so he had to withdraw and give up.
During this time, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer financial brands.
This was supported by millions of pounds for many sponsorships from the Six Nations rugby championship to the Wimbledon Andy Murray champion.
Now, however, it has been decided that it would be right for more national brands to come forward.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers but no new beginnings will be made.
All references to RBS will be changed to NatWest, except in cases of quota to the centre and stock market in England and Wales.
The Ulster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands to undertake a much more dominant task for individual banking; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan interviewed in a tour held for customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
The BBC told Scotland: "Since we will be a bank of more brands from now on, the RBS brand will no longer be the brand where our investor brand and staff are employed."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying we have local targets now, not global.
Each of these brands will come forward in a slightly different way in its community, and our staff will work with customers under the name of these brands.
RBS had announced that it would not continue sponsorship of the Six Nations championship and was raising the profile of different brands on sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to move on to the sense of brands bank because (we were asking ourselves) how can we make this a better bank for customers?" said the executive board chairman.
If we had stated three years ago that we would be a great bank for our customers and we would be presenting these brands, I would have found it sarcastic.
But I think you're going to see a lot of changes with the work we're doing and the focus on the needs of customers, not our own.
We can get these brands back online, so I think this is the right time.
Frankie Dettori won for the 3000th time with Predilection's victory at Newmarket.
Dettori burst champagne after reaching his 3000th victory with his double success at Newmarket
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3000th victory in England at Newmarket on Friday.
On his local track, he reached this milestone, winning his second victory of the night with Predilection trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in an unimpaired run.
He's following in the footsteps of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"This is a special occasion," said the jockey, who had three previous victories in Ghayyar.
I'm so touched that my parents are here.
I'm really happy that this is happening at the Newmarket where I started 30 years ago.
This isn't an important meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's just a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel light and relaxed.
Dettori accepted cheers by bringing Predilection after victory
He became the two jockeys who reached this milestone in the hurdled run: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired jockey Sir Anthony McCoy, who had won 20 times and had over 4300 victories in his record-filled career.
Lester Piggott, who has won the Derby race nine times, has 4493 victories in his career
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of our time, and it's no surprise that only a few people have reached a milestone before him.
A person of style and strength, but the element that makes him outweigh others in the scales is the tactical mentality he has.
He represents the horse race in an extraordinary way, drawing people into this sport for years with his excitement and charisma about it.
A few weeks ago, at Epsom, I told Frankie that if it wasn't for a jockey who only competed on weekends and big races, he might have made it to his 6000th victory.
To be serious, Frankie spent most of the 30 years he competed in the United Kingdom with victories, which is great to see.
He has a very exciting character, and that's a very good feature for British racing, but beyond that, he's an extraordinary jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this milestone with a leaping off-horse move that became a symbol.
With many movements from the races he finished jumping, to their descent from horse to horse, Frankie Dettori has become a symbol of British unblocked runs for twenty years.
It was a road full of ups and downs.
In 1996, he won many major races, including the famous 'Big Seven' victory at Ascot, but survived a plane crash and was banned due to his failure to comply with the drug ban.
During the return from this six-month suspension three years ago, he initially suffered difficulties, but showed that he had a strong character in the way needed to prove those who suspected him wrong and return to his best.
And it could go on for a while; Dettori had previously expressed that he wanted to continue competing until he was at least 50 years old.
Russian president Putin dismisses chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr Ivanov was part of the immediate environment that Mr. Putin trusted for many years.
63-year-old was now appointed as special representative for environmental and transport problems.
A statement from the Kremlin said Mr. Putin had "decided to terminate Ivanov's post as Russia's director", but no reason was given.
Anton Vaino, who has been acting for Mr Ivanov for this position since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the International Relations (MGIMO) department of the well-known Moscow State Institute and served at the Tokyo embassy.
He then dealt with the presidential protocol and the administration of government staff; statements on the Kremlin website are like this (in Russian).
After his deployment, he told Mr. Putin, "Thank you for trusting me."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of law-making and overseeing the implementation of instructions.
On Friday, Mr Putin announced to the Russian television station that he had asked Mr Ivanov to step down and recommended Mr. Vaino to take his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a move that amazes Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov had long worked as one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies, and Soviet security forces such as himself had served the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful people in the country as a chief of staff.
At a meeting with President Putin and aired on state television, both expressed that the chief of staff had voluntarily withdrawn from office.
Despite the smiling poses given to the cameras, however, few are convinced of this; especially at this time when parliamentary elections are approaching.
So is this some kind of dispute from a power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
The official statement, however, that a person who could become president suddenly wanted to direct Russia's environmental policy was met with grave doubts.
According to the quote on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said of Mr. Putin: "It is true that in a conversation in early 2012, you can call this difficult -- even problematic -- that I ask you to trust me for the task for four years.
Well, apparently I served as the chief of staff for four years, eight months.
Mr Ivanov assumed this post in December 2011.
He had previously served as deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security forces, such as Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Putin was the head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), replacing the KGB, while Mr. Ivanov was his guardian.
When Mr. Putin took power, he cited Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
Since Mr. Putin's third term as president was unconstitutional, it was believed that Mr. Ivanov could become president after Mr. Putin's second term.
However, this mission was transferred to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin became Prime Minister three and a half years later, before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of Criminal Minds, was fired after hitting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical fight last month on the show's set in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produced the show, announced in a joint statement that he had been laid off.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Tuesday, prior to the announcement of the annulment.
There were differences and a dispute on the set about creative issues.
"I regret that such an incident has taken place," he said in a statement.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios announced that detailed information on how to remove the character played by Gibson from the program that follows a group of FBI agents will be provided at a future date.
The 54-year-old actor, who had previously appeared in the situation comedy Dharma & Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
Gibson said in a statement released on Friday, "I love Criminal Minds and have worked for the past twelve years giving him my heart and soul."
I'd like to stay until the end, but that's not possible anymore.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, most importantly, the best supporters a show can have.
The program is expected to return to screens on September 28 for the twelfth season.
The mystery of the fish in the Banff garden
A person living in the Banff area applied for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks these 75 fish could be sand fish carried by a sea hose.
Bain, who lived 500 m from the sea, released the footage on Periscope in the hope that someone would shed light on the emergence of fish two inches long.
Queensferry Pass: The bridge is now connected to Fife
Project worth £1.35 billion must be completed by May 2017
Engineers combined the north and viaduct of Queensferry Pass; this means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between "tabli fan", which is about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 46 support cables with 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete.
The £1.35 billion project must be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown became one of the first to walk from land to bridge by visiting facilities today.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Pass.
We're all witnessing engineering on an epic scale with this project, which uses over 30,000 tons of concrete to build just this part of the bridge.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge that closed the gap between the viaduct and the bridge tab, a delicate work requiring highly sensitive tolerances for this harmony.
Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge tab is already in place, the concrete dump of the first cut of the table will be carried out today in Rosyth, which means the entire table will be ready to be removed on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Parade and Bridge Contractors project, said: "In all bridge projects, the first closure is always an important milestone.
In this extraordinary project, this closure represents pioneering civil engineering.
After the final highway tab was placed and connected to the expanding North Tower level, we had to close the gap on the north- or land-side.
This was done when the northern viaduct was pulled about 700 millimetres south.
It was a very large but also very delicate procedure.
The reason it was large was because the viaduct was 222 meters long, weighing almost 6,000 tons, and had to be pulled at about 3% slope.
The reason why it was sensitive was because the team had very low tolerance values to match; on both sides it was only a few millimeters.
Thank God everything went well.
Moelfre Bay rescue team: Three men 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to have survived" after they fell off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station sounded an alarm Friday, at 13:20 p.m. British summer time, after the gear saw the case in Moelfre Bay.
Three men were struggling to swim into a secure area as their boat continued on its own.
Moelfre lifeboat controller said, "We've seen the boat circling them in circles and we've been worried."
He added, "Unfortunately, he had gone away with strong winds until we were on our way to them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the 60-year-old third man was found exhausted, clinging to a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all taken to the lifeboat headed for shore and brought to the lifeboat station.
Mr. Jones said: "Three men who have fallen into the water are lucky to be alive and have never been injured.
The boat engine had an emergency stop cord, but when the boat capsized, it must have broken off somehow from the person who was driving the boat.
Someone was watching these three guys today.
A valuable species of hunting for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It's amazing how the world has changed.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer went out to play games, that they preferred to spend their free time looking at screens, was a situation that most people have been upset about over the past decade.
Pokémon Go encourages people to get off the couch and move.
The time spent looking at the screens spread over time to video games and finally to smartphones while initially limited to television.
So it's really great to see that technology and outdoors aren't the elements that exclude each other.
Of course, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, an app that was originally created for video game in the '90s (later turned into cartoons, playing cards and other byproducts).
Like many of the facts of popular culture, this new game had made a scene when it was presented in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Subsequently, the presentation was delayed in other countries due to intense interest in the servers causing overload.
Within days, Pokémon reached more users than Go Tinder and almost the same number of users as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, players take their smartphones, go looking for Pokémon in the manner followed by GPS, and can 'take a picture of what they find' (by taking screenshot on the phone) or 'catch' them.
A generation who played the game at a younger age came off the couch and joined this madness.
In the United States, the game provided a significant increase in the number of steps a "average" person made every day.
Cardiogram, an app developed for Apple Watch and monitoring 35,000 users, stated that the rate of person exercising for 30 days each day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent among those he had recently followed to the Washington Post during the two days after the game was presented.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go; it can only see raw data at the exercise level.
Most public health campaigns, which encouraged people to take "30 minutes of time", "get off the couch", and "be active every day", were ignored due to the fact that most public health messages were boring and transmitted by people who seemed miserable.
But still, the importance of exercise is little to be emphasized.
Regular exercisers are less likely to have cancer or depression.
Exercise provides assistance on issues such as weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, where it has a list of advantages too long to be listed.
However, the beauty of Pokémon Go is that he takes people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, all three essential elements of health are met: action, fresh air, and fun with sunlight.
Some may even make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, there are grouchy buzzkills looking for something to complain about.
And then, of course, someone can hit the door when they're walking.
What difference does it make?
A great innovation was presented.
Intelligent phone applications such as Fitbit followed our movement, but did not give us any reason to exercise like this game.
Innovation will wear off and use will fade over time.
However, due to Pokémon's success, many games will be produced that help people who go hunting through combining practices and virtual reality with activities in the real world to become more active, fit and healthy.

Simone Biles won the gold medal in the women's gymnastics general evaluation
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
He's dynamic about jumping.
It's comfortable with the balance device.
It's amazing with the floor.
Perfection down at first.
And he's an Olympic champion now.
The 19-year-old American gymnast also finished first in the overall assessment on Thursday, making clear the difference between himself and the rest of the world at the Olympics.
His total score was 62,198, far above Aly Raisman, a silver medalist and friend of the "Last Five" team, and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States performed on a balance instrument Thursday in the women's artistic gymnastics general evaluation final at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil.
Biles became the fourth and fifth American woman overall to receive the consecutive overall assessment award and announced her name as the best of her generation and perhaps of all time.
When the final total was published, he burst into tears and his long journey to reach this moment ended.
This success brought sports to the same level as athletes such as Michael Phelps, who can be seen once in a generation that leads to new levels:
Biles spent his last three years as one of the most successful in this sport, with 15 world championship medals, 10 of which were gold, and a stunning combination of ambition and precision routines that allowed the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton to call himself "the best gymnast I've ever seen".
In Brazil, a final test awaited him; this competition was not between Biles and other people in the field but between himself and the burden of great expectations.
His return to the family home in Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals, would be seen as disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Aly Raisman, after taking gold and silver medals in the overall evaluation of artistic gymnastics women at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil, Thursday, Agu.
Biles won the first on Tuesday, when national team coordinator Martha Karolyi, who retired, served as an exclamation mark at her farewell party.
Although Biles insists that he never looked forward to his long run towards the top, that's not entirely true.
The part of the ground exercise routine, which includes the rounded passage that has become a symbol of the routine, is prepared with Latin music that will fully adapt to the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a child and discovered by Boorman's mother on a trip to a gym where Aimee Boorman coached, became a force.
He has not lost any of the overall assessments since the summer of 2013; this is a winning streak that he must continue as long as Biles wishes.
Mustafina assumed the lead in two rotations, but this was temporary.
The balance device and ground exercises in which Biles won the world championship had not yet been performed.
He took the lead with 15,433 points in the balance instrument and crowned it with 15,933 points in ground exercise as well.
While Raisman was waiting for the final score, he gave her a gentle hug, and while Biles' vision once wrote in a sketchbook came true, tears appeared around the glowing red, white and blue eye makeup.
Raisman's performance was like a rematch of the performance four years ago, when he shared fourth place but later lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans call "Nine", took the lead.
From time to time, he sent a kiss to the crowd after a ground exercise he overcame with a return that seemed suspicious.
For 19-year-old Biles, it can be said that his much shared tweet earlier this week has now come to a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
In Phoenix's first serial killer case in ten years, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot while talking and listening to music, according to police reports released Thursday.
Officials testified that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a parked car on June 12.
The report states that the gunman fired eight shots with a pistol while standing on the passenger side of the car and drove away with another vehicle.
Police say these three murders didn't appear to be a robbery because the attacker didn't take the adult victims' handbags or $2,900.
Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Howard, a spokesman for Phoenix police, testified that the shooting led investigators to investigate whether this was linked to the previous four attacks.
Over a four-month period, seven people were killed and two injured in nine attacks, mainly in neighborhoods inhabited by Hispanic origins.
At the beginning of this month, Howard announced to CBS affiliate KPHO, "This happened in the residential area in front of a house."
The suspect is believed to have driven several vehicles in a late 1990s model, including brown Nissan, black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln in a late 1990s model.
Researchers refused to reveal evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were related to the same killer and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to hospital due to his injuries and subsequently died.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for these people to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Officials also released a police report on the shooting that targeted an empty truck half an hour before the three murders.
Researchers found shell casings, pulled a bullet out of a seat, and found bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old microcephaly patient: "It's getting better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, his toys, and, of course, his mother.
Unlike his peers, however, Edmund has a microcephali disorder; this is a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did not know existed during her pregnancy.
When you first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't ask for this.
Of course it's not true, of course you want it."
He and his wife, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never know them or even survive them.
Some doctors have gone so far as to propose that she be admitted to a nursing home.
Picciuto said, "My first reaction was to say that I don't think people are doing this anymore."
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund could not sit upright or crawl until he was three years old and still cannot speak.
But he's slowly reaching some of the turning points.
He can walk with help and ride a bike.
Besides, she likes to play games and sing with her two brothers.
Elizabeth is showing Edmund's sign language to say, "Please sing to me."
Picciuto told CBS News, "We're teaching him sign language."
But it's not sign language as we know it, it says Edmund made up his own markings.
Microcephali can arise due to a series of different situations; a genetic condition such as Edmund may be present and may result from infections generated by viruses such as measles and Zika during pregnancy.
Symptoms and the course of the disease can vary greatly.
It's too early to tell how the lives of people with Zika infection will be affected.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of uncertainty of his future.
I kept asking what was going to happen.
What's it gonna be?
And he still doesn't know it.
In fact, since I didn't expect anyone to actually tell me, I haven't asked a question about the course of the disease in a long time.
However, Picciuto is in a position to offer hopeful advice for the mothers of infants with a natural apology due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain and flooding in Louisiana, Mississippi have mobilized rescue teams
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected by Saturday.
National Weather Services reported flooding in numerous rivers northeast of Louisiana and south of Mississippi, which poses a widespread danger of flooding following heavy rain flow.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards stated that state officials were constantly in contact with local authorities and support for neighborhoods affected by the situation was on their way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office for Homeland Security and Emergency Preparation, said requests were made for high water vehicles, boats and trenches.
Steele testified that tons of trenches were requested for the Tangipahoa Neighborhood alone.
A flood watch will be carried out in most of southern Louisiana by Saturday.
Weather services have stated in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rainfall may fall on the area.
In southern Alabama, there was a flood watch on Saturday, as rain continued in the Mobile area.
Record levels are expected to be reached during weekdays at the Comite River near Baton Rouge, both in Louisiana, and the Amite River near Denham Springs.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also stated that the flood flow in Ascension Neighborhood poses a threat, as the hail rivers flow slowly into Maurepas Lake.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi state line, the Tickfaw River had already reached its highest level measured at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescue teams continue to rescue people from flooding in Amite and Wilkinson accidents in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson, were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that waters from Beaver Creek, normally 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly during the night.
He testified that another stepson who lived nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water kept coming," Hansford said.
It was all the way up to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level he had seen in the creek during the 48 years he lived here.
Hansford testified that he and his family members were disabled and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said he rescued all three of the emergency workers in a large, military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they took refuge on Friday.
As heavy rains continued, Krautmann expressed that the flooding was "surprising rapidly" and that authorities were consideringsuing an evacuation order.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston reported that it rained 13.75 inches from midnight to Friday morning.
The ground has been highly saturated since Wednesday, Krautmann said.
The authorities said that the streets under heavy rains and flooding gave rise to the need for rescue of residents of Tangipahoa Neighborhood and the holidaying of schools in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a female city councillor in Tangipahoa said 200 houses were flooded.
Residents were evacuated into two churches, but these are now flooded.
Neighborhood Manager Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who were trapped due to rising waters.
Refuges were opened for evacuees in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond.
"When the waters begin to retreat, they will be allowed to return home," he said.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa Neighborhood, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to rising waters and trenches were offered to be taken by residents who were trying to keep the water away from their homes and businesses.
"The last major flooding we experienced was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrative director.
Well, that sounds like a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison Accident Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said the rain was steady on the Gulf Coast.
He stated that several homes had been reported to have been flooded on Tuesday, but there were no reports so far for Friday.
Keith Townson, director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
Townson said, "I've seen water where I've never seen water before," and added, "and there's still rain."
6-year-old Mahaj Brown, whose body was riddled with bullets, survived the Philadelphia attack alive
Police have announced that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, which is the second incident in the city this week when a 6-year-old boy was shot.
CBS identified Mahaj Brown for Philadelphia as his grandparents.
His grandparents testified that Brown had multiple firearms injuries in his body, including the groin area, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious as he was brought to the hospital.
Delores Melendez, her grandmother, explained to the station, "She suffered too much, her tiny torso was riddled with bullets."
I can't believe this.
He was listed among those who maintained his son's critical condition at the hospital and underwent some surgeries.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He would start first class at local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown area.
Two 29 and two 32-year-old males were also shot.
CBS Philadelphia stated that one of the 29-year-old men was in critical condition and that the other two victims were stable.
The station reported that the boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with one of the 29-year-old men in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating if one of the injured was an attacker.
Investigators have testified to CBS Philadelphia that multiple armed assailants may have fired on each other.
The crime scene was loaded with shell casings in the style of assault weapons belonging to different assault weapons.
Looks like there's definitely been a long-term shootout.
There were hives on the street and on both sides of the sidewalk.
This suggests that multiple armed attackers were found and both were active", Philadelphia Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple homes and vehicles in the area were also damaged.
No arrests have been made, and police are reported to have been examining the security cameras.
Another 6-year-old girl was shot in the arm on Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak neighborhood.
He's in recovery, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie are the reason we need them.
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team, and there's more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been more dominant.
Second: This team has three gymnasts who inspire many girls with different ethnicities: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
The structure of this team, brought together by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally looks like America.
It also strengthens the presence of black and Latino women in the upper levels of this sport.
In the past four years, the first female gymnast has always been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
It's a powerful thing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America supported her.
The entire world will now be able to witness the extraordinary performances of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, three World Championships, of their unexpected but masterful gymnastics routine.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal in the overall assessment of women.
And his teammate Aly Raisman also won the silver medal.
We recognize the best times of this sport, but that's not what it looks like at gymnastics courses across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison to take part in the Olympic teams.
The reason they are the Final Five is because only four gymnasts will be found on the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi will coach.
In reality, however, gymnastics is a fairly costly sport and gymnasts work primarily at private gymnastics clubs that are supported by training, travel, jersey, competition, hotel fees (for managers, gymnasts, and families) and many other fees that parents pay.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburban neighborhoods, which can support these businesses.
These clubs are the only place gymnasts can train and require a costly and long-term commitment for the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles' trainer Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez' coach Maggie Haney have been training these athletes since the day they started gymnastics.
For countless young girls affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, we do not offer communities more affordable and accessible gymnastics training opportunities.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my establishments, based in Harlem, we offered free and low-cost gymnastics training to over 15,000 young people in the city (previously black and Hispanic) and coached both national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (where I grew up) to offer quality gymnastics training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this wonderful Olympic sport.
Gymnastics improves the body's strength, flexibility and coordination and provides mental hard work, discipline, and determination characteristics.
This combination offers long-term advantages in health, school, and business success.
What's going to lead thousands of young girls to gymnastics is going to be inspired by this team, and that's great.
Participation in sports activities is especially important to girls.
We're going through some really exciting times.
Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison, as the Olympic team, thank you for bringing the gold medal to make it clear that they showed "The Girls' Power" and motivated many young girls with different backgrounds to become a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, assistant doctors decided to continue the strikes.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after the agreement had been reached on the improved contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37,000 assistant doctors who participated in the vote voted against it.
In July, Mr Hunt announced NHS plans to implement sanctions on the contract, expressing that "no one has property" and that further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first group of assistant doctors was transferred to a new contract that included changes in working practices at night and weekends to improve maintenance outside normal hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, head of the UNA's board of resident doctors, said last night: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract; in particular, they think it will trigger the current labor crisis and not adopt an equal attitude to all doctors."
Progress has to be made in this process, which is only eight weeks before the first group of doctors is transferred to the new contract, and time is almost up.
The UNA's efforts to resolve the dispute by speaking were met with the government's reluctance to interact and, in some cases, deafening silence.
This is an improvement, despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act immediately, lift sanctions and listen to the concerns of resident doctors."
Residents make it clear that they are prepared to increase work-slowing actions if they do not do so.
During the last strike at the end of April, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments had been postponed, nurses and consultants had to cover for doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after an agreement was reached on the improved contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants improvements in weekend fees for 54,000 resident doctors on the contract issue.
Daniel Mortimer, executive board manager of NHS Employers, urged residents not to implement any strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Grev solves nothing, but by putting pressure on the already busy crew and services, causing concern, discomfort and distress for patients, caregivers and their families."
For the past two months, we have continued our talks with the Assistant Doctors Committee and, along with the Department of Health and other officials, we have positively approached their concerns about the Oversight Mission and the Report.
Employers were hopeful that maintaining positive communication in relation to important issues - such as distribution, educational flexibility, additional education costs for those who interrupt their careers, mutual understanding of education costs, educational leave on curriculum, and intersex pay difference in medicine, in accordance with agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May, was a sign of how serious it was taken by employers, the UK Department of Medical Education and Health.
Medicine that can eliminate the danger of a heart attack at a cost of £2 a day
Thousands of heart attacks will benefit from £2 a day after authorities suggest that it be given to more people for longer periods of time.
Preventing clotting, the ticigrelor reduces the risk of recurring crisis for people with heart disease.
The drug was given for 12 months following a heart attack and was reducing the risk of a stroke or another crisis.
The NHS observer, NICE, suggested that this be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, now the NHS observer, NICE, suggested that this be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, around 140,000 people in the UK have heart attacks, and a quarter of them suffer another crisis or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty matter accumulating and creating records on the arterial walls.
If your record disintegrates, it can cause a blood clot, preventing blood leading to the heart, causing a heart attack.
And if the clot is dislodged, it will go through the blood flow, causing a stroke in case it blocks the blood flow to the brain.
People who have had a crisis before are at greater risk of having another one.
Created by the United Kingdom firm AstraZeneca under the trade name Brilique, Ticagrelor reduces the risk by reducing the probability of clots.
The NICE manual draft, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of teagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg of practice with aspirin twice a day for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology assessment center, said: "Although effective secondary prevention treatments are available, a quarter of those suffering from heart attacks have another heart attack or stroke, and often the consequences of these are devastating."
Fear of relapse can have quite a negative effect on one's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that the use of the tycgregor with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of repeated heart attack and stroke in people who had previously suffered a heart attack.
We are pleased to have increased the treatment options offered to thousands of people who are waiting to benefit from the temporary proposal of the commercialist.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of the Ticagrelor is limited over three years -- primarily at the risk of bleeding -- the manual draft does not recommend treatment after this period.
PC culture boosts vote corruption in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed for corruption following a government report last year
As the devastating government report presented today shows, the culture of political accuracy has caused widespread vote corruption to be ignored in Muslim communities.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles rebuked police, election observers and the city hall for ignoring evidence of election misconduct for "excessive sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion".
The former community secretary and anti-corruption tsar of today said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is at such a bad level that police must be allowed to strip outside voting booths to protect the feared voters.
He suggested voters keep their identities with them to prove their identity at the time they voted.
In the current case, the voter's name and address are enough.
The report even recommends permanent ink on the finger during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said that those who called it in need better protection.
He called for better access to the press on board documents and the decisions of informal committees or working groups.
"This aims not only to provide protection against fraud in the elections, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was prepared at the instruction of Downing Street following Tower Hamlets' vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that Mayor Lutfur Rahman be relieved of his post after repeated corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "absently abused" the religious feelings of Muslim society and silenced those who criticized him on charges of racism and Islamophobia.
It was expressed that Rahman "runs his campaign based on the basis that it is a religious duty for faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 games were suspicious or the result of the use of false identity, i.e. voting as if it were someone else.
Sir Eric has testified that there has been evidence of fraud across the country.
He himself specifically warned about corruption in voting by mail - where it was alleged that the elderly individuals of the Muslim community had put pressure on voting for the island of their choice.
Sir Eric has made some suggestions to regulate the voting system, which includes having IDs with them to prove who they are.
His report included the following statements: "There has been evidence of pressure from some ethnic minority communities to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi descent.
"There were concerns that state institutions had ignored such behavior due to "political accuracy" based on ethnicity and extreme sensitivity to religion."
Sir Eric proposed 50 proposals to regulate the system in a way that included preventing political activists from processing voting papers by mail for a "vote collection" purpose.
The report, examined by Theresa May, also calls for tightening registration checks to prevent the election register from being used for immigration and outreach corruption purposes.
Considering the option of conditioning voters to show identification before voting.
The permanent ink on one's fingers after voting to prevent anyone from voting twice.
The conduct of systematic controls on one's nationality to determine fitness to vote.
Three-year limitation of demands for voting by automatic mail.
Banning political campaign officials and activists from processing the votes sent in completed mail and the envelopes of mailed votes.
The police are authorized to draw lanes around voting booths.
The amendment of the law to facilitate the charge of scaring people under the Public Representation Act of 1983.
The illegalization of photographing in voting booths.
The requirement is that only English be spoken in voting booths (except Wales).
A strengthening of the training the staff receives on the sanction of the rule for voters to enter the cabinet alone.
Sir Eric relentlessly criticized the Police Department, saying that no charges were made in the Tower Hamlets case "interesting".
"The election court ruled there was no room to charge Lutfur Rahman and his representative with repeated corruption and illegal activities," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt -- based on the nature of the evidence.
He also criticized the city hall's "box marking controls" that were not effective in the electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Tower Hamlets' court ruling last year was a warning alert.
Although our nation has the pride of creating the mother of parliaments, the widespread and rejection of these alarming and secret electoral corruptions and rejection by some institutions may cause this good reputation to be undermined.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist-like and other famous likes of Rio Olympic Players
This week, Rio 2016 Olympics enthusiasts went insane for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is not the only athlete noted for his resemblance to celebrities while competing for the gold medal this summer; at least that's what social media thinks.
Therefore, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces we've seen on our screens, FEMAIL has prepared a list of Olympic athletes who resemble Hollywood celebrities beyond resemble them.
Hunter and wolf: US Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison (left) has been confronted by Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's similar on the bike track, many in the online environment showed that an archer could look just as much like Leonardo DiCaprio as his twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Archery Team, waved Twitter after photos of him showing his resemblance to the star of the movie Money Hunter.
And the archer, realizing this madness in social media, admitted that he had been told since childhood that he looked like Leo.
Brady told the Huffington Post: 'I don't think there's much resemblance except hair and beard.'
'He's a handsome man, so I guess that's a compliment.'
There is another similarity, one of London 2012's most popular comparisons, which will undoubtedly be even more noted this year: the incredible resemblance of British long jump athlete Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina was expressed to be the exact likeness of Cuban American artist Gloria Estefan, with large and meaningful eyes.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee's star Matthew Morrison for years.
Change: This user states that Nathan's Startup movie star is an 'athletic version'
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have been compared to each other for a long time due to his thick eyebrows and the resemblance of his lips.
The Russian team's silver medalist says that while she has the same bronze skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, her fans Nathan Adrian of the U.S. Team are 'like the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt'.
Tough women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter's star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face shape and eyes
Not alone: a Twitter user is very pleased that other people have noticed this similarity
A theory in the air: this user thinks there might be a reason behind this pair being in a similar appearance.
A Twitter user moved her happiness to this site about "the fact that the rest of the internet also thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are like twins."
In reality, the American football star and the actress who plays for Dexter has similar facial features and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's almost identical smile, with Gabby Douglas, another gold medalist gymnast, and Gabrielle Union, star of the film Youth Fire, who resembled each other.
CBC Olympic announcer apologised for Chinese swimmer's comment that 'he died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place in the 4x200 m free race angered those watching CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize for one of its announcers' comments that the 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer had 'gone away like a bad smell' and 'died like a pig' in the race.
Spiker Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when she began explaining her own ideas in the women's 4x200 m free relay final.
Involved to add 'color' to CBC's announcer team, MacDonald was heard to make the following remarks: '14-year-old Chinese heavy sacked, baby'.
He was overexcited, wiped out like a bad smell, and died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
China Swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) finished the second leg of the relay for 1:57.79, remaining 1.61 seconds behind Canadian Taylor Rack, allowing Canadians to close the gap between China and China.
Canadian audiences quickly act after being stunned by the tone and language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did CBC announcer just say that the 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig?'
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air.'
Chinese Ai Yanhan was described as follows in the 4 x 200 m Free Flag Race: '14-year-old little Chinese fuck up heavy, baby.'
Criticisms were released on Twitter about Byron MacDonald, and many of them were capable of turning himself in.
Twitter users couldn't help but notice how insensitive Byron Macdonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all look racist.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russel, who continued the CBC's broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment: 'We apologize for the comment given to the broadcast regarding the swim race'.
Those were really unfortunately chosen words, we're sorry that such an event happened.'
CBC had to apologize to tweeters at least 90 more times in response to the comment.
Scott Russel, another anchor, was forced to apologize on MacDonald's behalf.
CBC then copied and pasted this apology to over 90 Twitter users who relayed their complaints about MacDonald's comments.
The network issued a statement, quickly apologizing.
We would like to express our sincere regret that these statements have been made and that they have been put on the air.
Last night, we quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and our followers on social media.
We would like to explain that Byron's comments were not about the swimmer's personality, but about his performance.
However, these were rather inappropriate and unfortunately chosen words, and Byron is deeply upset by what he said.
On Thursday, in the afternoon, MacDonald also apologized on the air and attempted to defend his remarks, saying he did not want to make a personal attack.
'I'd like to apologize for a comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
'I was referring not to the swimmer's personality, but to his performance.'
'No more words, no disrespect, and I'm very sorry.'
The Primark client threw up anger at the woman in the middle of the store who was recklessly trying on underwear.
Customers did not know what to do when a woman took off her clothes to try panties on the store floor in the middle of the Primark.
Even worse, she looked at what it looked like on herself, took it off and put it back on the shelf.
He kept looking and then tried on four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
The place where she tried on panties before she put them back on the shelf was the Primark store at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children who were at the time in the store, testified that after trying on the mystery woman's underwear, she was 'redressed and left the store without buying anything'.
He said: 'People couldn't believe their eyes.'
He stood in the middle of the store and took a pair of panties out of the window, taking off his pantyhose and pants, wearing them.
'He didn't try to look for a special place to do it, he was standing in the middle with all his disrespect.'
'Everyone was looking at him as he pulled out the cinder block and it seemed like he didn't like the panties because he put them back on the shelf.'
He tried on three more laundry until he decided he didn't like anything, and then left the store dressed again.
'He didn't seem to care who was watching him, and he wasn't thinking about the person who was going to buy the panties he was trying on later.'
Mrs. Davidson (33), who lives in the town of Kent, said: 'How disgusting to think that someone else would take an uncleaned pair of panties and go home.'
This incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: 'I think Personelin took the clothes off the market by finding them after he left, which is a good situation.'
'When I got a new pair of panties and went home, it would be really awful to think that someone else had taken them off and came to me without washing them."
A Primark spokeswoman said: 'Primark is aware of what happened at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday (August 9th).'
The related product has been removed from sale.
How can you defend yourself against armed attacks with Krav Maga?
The outside world is quite dangerous, but this video, presented by Dailymail.com, may help you to be safer.
We met Rhon Mizrachi, chief master of the Krav Maga Federation, based in New York City, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the situation against the robber.
Mizrachi says when you're approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around and see the attacker and clear the line of fire.
Then you're gonna hold the gun between your forearm and your shoulder, and you're gonna hit him in the face with your empty elbow.
Then, when you knee him in the groin, the pain of the attacker will double, and at this stage you will take the gun away from him, and you will strike him in the face, with the barrel of the gun pointed at him, and the rear side will stay up.
A similar technique is applied when the gunman approaches from the front; you draw your body from the line of fire and grab the gun and turn it around in ways the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, by putting your weight into the gun, you punch the attacker in the chest area, you turn the gun around and take it away from him, and you pull the gun against him.
Does that sound tricky?
Take a look at the video to see how Mizrachi did it.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid any robbery is to give your money to the robber.
Traveler Ian Wright put his tongue in the dirtiest parts of Europe for his travel guide
The British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and gag reflex by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and travel writer, Ian Wright of Suffolk (51), drove his tongue to a Euro note, a Piccadily Circus banister, a train toilet flush button, and a payphone in Russia to prove the power of the immune system.
He used a leminometer to show himself and us what kind of work he was involved in before licking each object.
However, the experiment, which would be transformed into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, yielded some surprising results.
Although the thought of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people is extremely disgusting, in fact, there are far worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his trip to Europe, Mr. Wright met with doctors and medical experts regarding increased stomach bacteria and health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked made an impression other than the bad taste he left in his mouth.
Mr. Wright has been known to test the endurance of his stomach by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From the general banisters at the railway stations to the toilet flushes, this task, at a wide range, tested the immune system for sure.
In the film about this, he said: 'I have never been much of a health caregiver since I was a child, and I have put many things in my mouth from earth to worm and muddy water.'
During the film, he proved his reputation with certainty.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The crawl sample showed a count of over 4,000 units of luminometers.
In comparison, the number should be below 60 in freshly washed hands.
But there was a Russian public restroom in newly washed hands that he refused to lick when his lemometer count went up over 4,000 units while it was under 60.
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the film The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as bathrooms.
He said in the movie, 'This is about to be one of the worst things I smell in a toilet.'
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was prepared along with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which included lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, which helped strengthen stomach bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior Vice President of Valio's Department of Snacks, Juices and New Categories, said: "We really wanted to present something new to the consumers.
Something that's impressive to watch and also explains the benefits of probiotics.
We finally had a lot of crazy brainstorms where the idea of "come on, let's look for Ian."
They claim that interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put products in a much larger context; on a daily basis, good and bad bacteria around us, the importance of stomach health, and the connection it has to the immune system.
Interest in stomach health is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we would be able to give consumers more interesting information about this situation.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me put it this way; if Ian had licked some of the things I wanted him to lick like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost respect for him.'
Naturally, it was easy for Ian to lick things, but some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we're recording some of these dirty licks.'
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with stomach health, and 58 per cent said they used products containing lactic acid bacteria at least intermittently.
Maganda family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall social housing before evacuation
A family of ruffians left £50,000 worth of damage in the social residence where they were evacuated for scaring their neighbors.
Following many complaints about Tanya Skeldon and his wife Shaun Trebilcock, Saltash was expelled from the residence in Cornwall.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, housing association officials were surprised to see that the property was irreparable.
There were large holes in the walls, floorboards were removed, garbage was scattered on the floor, and graffiti was written on the walls.
The family is now suspended and is believed to be taking advantage of private accommodation options
Cornwall Housing housing manager Donna McEvoy expressed fear that the situation would be unsavory.
He said: 'This is indeed a nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
He has a lot to attend to because this property will now be known as an unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and a bad reputation.
The family had three sons who occasionally lived on the property, and according to police, the family had adopted many frightening behaviors, including fighting with a baseball bat in the street, scaring nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing, and excessive shouting, arguing, and blasphemy.
In June, antisocial behavior was decided for Skeldon (47), whose name was on the lease.
Old garbage was found in many rooms of the house that were supposed to be destroyed.
In the past, the floorboards of the drug-smuggling property had been removed
Neighbors said they saw them fighting in the street and police were often searched.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evacuated him and his wife from the property this week after giving them 11 weeks of recognition as extended for their voluntary move.
The evacuation was welcomed by relieved neighbors who said their lives were turning into a nightmare.
One person said, 'They didn't care about anyone.'
We've been living next to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You wouldn't believe how many times we've seen cops here.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We woke up because it was so quiet; we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, and it's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighborly sanctioning officer, testified that the family was not cooperating with the local administration.
The family had been living in this house for 20 years, and police were often called to the property.
Garbage and old toys were dumped on the plant side of social housing.
He added: 'It is indeed a shame that the renter did not take any responsibility for the evacuation of himself and his family; the evacuation has always been the option that Cornwall Housing applied for last.
This was a very difficult case, since behavior was extreme and its actions were too frightening for neighbors to witness.
I highly appreciate the efforts of my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police Force, and the bravely prominent community members to inform us.
I hope this development will provide some relief for the neighbors and be understood as a message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said they had three sons living on the property at different times, but they were in their 20s.
A dirty bed left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the evacuation.
Housing workers will have to clean up the garbage piles surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of cannabis, tarts, private items and £1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after Class B pleaded guilty to possession of drugs with intent to sell.
He claimed to use the money to buy a headstone for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it became clear that Tanya and her husband were now living in a private residence in Plymouth.
Most of the house's rooms had graffiti on their walls.
Police have stated that they will work to evacuate tenants who violate the lease rules
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police Force said the evacuation was also a warning for other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'This is also a message for those who think that they can act as they please without facing any accusations and that their actions will be in vain', he said.
Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, who will continue to work with their partners to protect society, will never tolerate crime and antisocial behavior.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified by the low-flying military plane just over the beach
Tourists sunbathing in Portugal, Aveiro have experienced the shock of their lives
The Portuguese air force P-3C Orion flew extremely low
The air force said it was a training flight, but insisted there was no security risk.
This is the moment the tourists start panicking as we go over the beach full of low-flying jets.
Dramatic footage shows military aircraft approaching those sunbathing on sand at Aveiro in northern Portugal at almost contact level.
Holidayers stood up from the clouds as they were clearly concerned about the noise generated by jet engines before they could see what was coming towards them.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationers who shared a video of the dramatic close-up flight on social media, said: 'He's gone really low twice and looked like he was about to crash at some point.'
Nuno added Arroja: 'I was surfing and I swear I felt like the plane was going to crash on me.'
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane out of the darkness began to fly at extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats on the beach and that he had to go that low since it was the only way to control them.
Due to smoke from the nearby fire, visibility was weak, the jet flew lower than usual, but the air force insisted that no one's safety was compromised.
This summer, fires that were difficult to extinguish destroyed certain sections on the Portuguese mainland, causing the deaths of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today that the pilot must fly low due to conditions (intensive fog and smoke from fires that are difficult to suppress) that make sight difficult.
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats.
London schoolgirl, who joined ISIS, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three English female students who left London to join ISIS last year, reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee testified that his family had received information about his death in Rakka, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that he was thought to have died in a Russian air strike on the Rakka region, where the group was strong in the country.
Sultana was 17, and according to his family, died while planning to flee the war-damaged country and return to Britain.
Akunjee "We hope that this situation will emphasize that it is really risky for others to go to war zones as a tombstone and will, and discourage people from making that choice."
In February 2015, Sultana and two female students from eastern London had boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid stated that if Clinton was elected, he would not give up Garland as a Supreme Court candidate.
In the Senate, Democratic Leader Harry Reid expressed faith that the Democrats would nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have been blocking Garland's approval process since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell testified that the new president would choose who would replace former Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
In a video speech on Thursday, Reid expressed belief that Clinton would choose Garland and that he "had reasons for it."
Later, a spokesman for Reid said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether to nominate Garland and speculated.
He praised Garland and expressed that Clinton's team did not want to "disrupt the current situation" by making a new choice.
Garland, Columbia State Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Reid testified that the Republicans, who prevented Garland from being nominated, were "assistors" and "burners" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He stated Trump was unfit for duty.
Treats stated that he was in favor of a naked calendar 'for women as well as for men'.
Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of famous and naked people, however, they are working to find new generation top models for the 2017 NU Inspires calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of the Treats, had expressed that this magazine, which had a high nudity rate earlier this year, was different from the old Playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
He obviously believes that's the calendar.
Shaw said in the calendar-related press release, "Like men, we need to go back to display the unfashionable, classic nudity in order for women to freely look at these images of the female body as inspiration."
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can send photos online or participate in open talks in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinil target: who really buys records?
Middle-aged, lonely men love vinyl.
Let us say that this statement is based on actual data before we go to the commentary department to make great insults under the name of all the Lonely Middle Men.
According to YouGov, the return of records, a much-mentioned subject, is not a result of the innovation-seeking Y generation created by a physical object, but of middle-age nostalgia.
Recent vinyl album purchasers are mostly between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24-year-old group is the lowest-case scenario.
This is also not only due to the accumulation action of enthusiasts; it has an emotional significance; older vinyl recipients often like to keep their feelings to themselves (56% and 53%) and people who enjoy being alone (69% and 66%).
And the results of YouGov are correct?
If this blog had been a televised story, the camera would have watched it say something authoritative like: "Let's take a look then, while walking on a crowded street of Soho, in a modest grey suit, making many gestures before stopping and putting my hands together and opening."
Well, let's have a look.
While Soho's headquarters gradually lost its magic and unusual air (the buildings where once independent dealers were located are now full of hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases) still have several specialist record stores.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next part; I would try to learn about their age and emotional status by staying close to different men in some of these stores.
From Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, possibly a woman in her 20s), Stuart of Glasgow (55), who I follow, spends the afternoon in London for a meeting and looks at stores to fill out a few empty hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
He says, "I guess I am."
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records (officially e-mailed to me, I didn't follow him home) above the picture, decorate the walls of the living room.
The reason he collects so many albums and singles is a result of his partially expendable income; he can now buy records he can't afford when he first comes out and buy back what he sells in his young and penniless times.
"Most of the things I bought were in the late '60s, early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12 years old; I was too young to buy," he says.
He agrees and adds, "I don't smoke, I don't drink a lot of alcohol.
That's my bad habit.
Wez (25), who works at Sister Ray, also thinks that most of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile.
However, he also realized that a new wave had formed that was influenced by overkill advertising in the media, and that people who heard that this fashion was coming back needed to buy back old records.
In my interviews, I realized that normally people were selling their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who used to sell vinyl to buy CDs now sell CDs to get records back," he says.
This may explain the increase in people of a certain age who reanimate the vinyl.
What about the alleged emotional significance of records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes you a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comfortable community of people of similar personality.
According to Wez, some older clients were particularly offended by the non-contact payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may want to seek refuge in the stability of familiar record covers, which are overwhelmed by the digital world and recall memories of calm youth again.
Wez says, "Sometimes it may be because of filling a void or seeing material items as some sort of comfort."
Since I'm a collector myself, I have this, and I think most people have it.
This is an easy way to fill your head.
"We're like social servants," says a colleague, who's popping out of a stack of records.
A April poll revealed last month that 50% of vinyl album recipients have not yet listened to the album.
The poll also revealed that 41% had a record player that they had never used, and that 7% had purchased vinyl even though they did not have a record player.
At this stage of the story, I would probably make a very concerned appearance when studying a series of bossa nova compositions.
The "ward" aspect of this comeback is also an element noticed by Jonny (42), who works at Sounds of Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
"Soon someone came to me and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record to put on our shelf."
This does not represent a large percentage, but it certainly reflects the current situation.
More products, less music.
There are people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're not the elderly, they're young, they're in their late teens, they're new introductors.
Now, when I get to Fopp, which has reserved almost an entire floor for vinyl, I see that the mass is quite variable.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, young boys and middle-aged women.
It is good to see diversity among customers, although the atmosphere is spreading sex content pop instead of less calm and soothing jazz from the stores mentioned above (the last piece of Wild Beast).
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to resolve psychological traumas that bother them by standing next to one for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora (27), has been strolling around Fopp for a few minutes looking at records on sale.
Instead of spending it, he just went out to look at the windows.
He says he doesn't have the option to collect records because he doesn't make much.
It's very costly.
It's easier to listen to music from the computer or in other ways, but the beauty of the vinyl..." she sighs away like a lover.
I don't know how to explain it, really.
My last stop is a store that is said to inspire new generation vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Outfitters.
While I pretend to be studying jeans, I observe a group of young girls gathered around Polaroid cameras for a while before a father and daughter argue about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell filled with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac; essential records for an average collection; a mix of modern and classics.
No one's looking; maybe it's just because it's decoration, some of it's too high to touch.
It's an artifice vinyl.
Curiosity for these items, however, could mean that the industry could earn more money and send fewer customers deep into Soho; there are not many issues to complain about.
It is not surprising that a demographic group with more money and time than most spends more money on more luxury items such as vinyl.
However, my findings show that YouGov's results are at least true in Soho record stores; they do not account for female collectors and vinyl enthusiasts, who are numerous, in reality, in record stores or online forums.
These people probably work pretty hard at school or offices.
These people certainly do not spend Thursday evenings wandering through record stores on Berwick Street, studying records, and avoiding the looks of a 30-year-old fake television presenter looking over the shoulders of middle-aged men who know nothing.
Greenland shark, the longest-lived vertebrate animal in the world - video news
Scientists have explained that the Greenland shark is the longest of vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who conducted studies on sharks, stated that the record belonged to a five-metre-long female, thought to be between the ages of 272 and 512.
French court rejects offer to demolish stores at Jungle refugee camp
A court in France rejected an offer made by Calais officials to demolish dozens of chop shops and restaurants at Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees lived.
In this week's court hearing, Calais officials argued that a total of 72 mill stores should be demolished, where the state sells many products from inside the camp to cigarette drinks, does haircuts, or sells them from basic foods for 50 cents (40p) for tea or a few euros.
The Governorate of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they created an untaxed parallel economy and have a risk in fire and hygiene.
Philanthropist groups have explained to the court that stores and restaurants are vital, free food offered by state-sponsored organizations and other groups is not enough for the growing population in the camp.
They argued that stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for needy people.
A court in Lille testified that there was no legal basis for deportation of persons running 72 mills of crack shops, but that the Governor of Calais' concerns were also "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Mullah testified that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants took on a much larger role than simply feeding people living in "extremely dangerous conditions".
He expressed that these areas provide comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
For non-profit Jungle Children, one of the places in danger of collapse, the Book Cafe offers 200 meals daily, teaches English and French, where hundreds of underage refugees in the camp are given advice on defection.
Over 170,000 people signed petitions to protect this cafe for children.
A letter to the Guardian stated that this shutdown "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the population in Jungle camp increased (the highest number to date) after increasing number of arrivals during the summer period.
After the gold in the Fiji master class, Britain was satisfied with the silver medal in the rugby sevens championship
Great Britain's impressive advance in the Rugby 7th Championship ended in the final Thursday with Fiji, following 43-7 defeats at Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji taught mastery of grip, pass, sidestep, support, running lines and muscle strength to take the gold medal, the first Olympic medal of each color.
Following defeat, Britain received the third silver medal of the day as a not-so-bad consolation prize, and can now be proud of their efforts at the Olympic 7th inaugural tournament, where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
At the beginning of the day, they may have found them in the final after being crushed 7-5 in the semifinals.
But still, a Fiji that fit could beat a team of 15.
Although it may not be very believable, perhaps Great Britain can find solace in the idea that at least one Brit will wear a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, an Englishman from Wimbledon.
This has been a very difficult journey for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Seven Championships.
This time, they only lost one.
Although this defeat is painful, the progress is truly astonishing.
Fiji got off to a fascinating start, with the players bouncing over Great Britain's attempts to get the ball.
This was like running between a series of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and the World Series champions took a 5–0 lead when Osea Kolinisao took action from the corner.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai faced another curved point from the right wing.
The match was 12–0 and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great intervention prevented Leone Nakarawa from throwing the third, like a mountain, but this was only to delay Fiji's number.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner and Great Britain fell back 17–0.
Just one minute to the end of the first half, while Nakarawa scored another home run from the top.
Later, Vatemo Ravouvou flew through some of the formidable Great Britain interventions to the line for the number.
With this number, the score reached 29-0 at halftime.
While Fiji was a team set up to play in the 7th Championship, Great Britain seemed to be trying to learn the basics.
That's more or less the case.
Great Britain made major changes at halftime and closed the Fiji dam for exactly four minutes, which was a good development for the first half until Josua Tuisova came on stage with the perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton scored a try for Great Britain and tried to score from the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game fans were in the hands of the South Sea Islanders who sang, waved flags and danced.
It was really hard not to admire Fiji's upbeat approach.
Maa Viliame also worshiped recent additions to the Fiji game, which in the last minutes did not require decoration.
When the whistle went off, the Fijians began celebrating and Great Britain took the road to the locker room, frustrated.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20–5 in the semi-finals, and Great Britain had also faced South Africa in a challenging semi-final match; Britain took the lead with a single point.
Kyle Brown put the South African team ahead in the first half, but Dan Norton took the lead with dizzying foot movements with numbers he had taken in the second half.
With the wonderful intervention of Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who was in the top 15 of England, victory and silver medal were also guaranteed.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning ran to victory in the row, inspired by their trainers' struggle with cancer.
There will be no more emotional gold medal in these games, and that means something.
After 220 painful breaths from the first move to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they won gold in Estacio da Lagoa could be far more meaningful.
Although there were two men rowing the oars, there were three voices on the boat; as the women's double race advanced to the second consecutive gold Olympic medal as the first women to reach such a level in England this year, their trainer Robin Williams' voice was also echoing on the boat.
Their dominance was quite clear; this was their 39th race of unprecedented, invincibility series.
Although we see two great athletes floating on the surface of swan grace, this image does not fully reflect the quality of victory.
Behind each rowing gold medal, there is a battalion of willing hands that provide the positive gains that make this difference, and no hand was as effective as its trainers who didn't know if he would live to see the day when he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
Like he said, they touched it and left.
I got bladder cancer that could be treated with surgery, and that's what they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
That would be pretty bad.
This changes your view of life a little bit.
Williams had been diagnosed in December 2013.
He, himself, was very lucky to be able to begin treatment outside the season, in early 2014, the trio was very fortunate, in such cases whether there would be a correct expression, but in this way distraction would be able to minimize.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better fast.
That was an incentive for me.
I was in the hospital, and even though they said it was enough for me to take a few steps, I was walking about six, nine, 15 meters in the garden.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey on its own, but it makes it a little bigger.
After the victory, their minds were in Williams, who had had a tense morning, who spoke a little more than usual to overcome his own concerns.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Association and had previously been to Afghanistan, said, "I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe a little extreme, but it really means a lot."
This emphasizes once again what this means to me and how hard Helen, me and Robin have worked.
I had three great years with Helen and Robin.
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Robin, so I'd like to thank her for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find a better person or a better coach to work with.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
The two have hit a rough beat that their opponents can't reach.
Even in the last 500 metres when New Zealand and Danish teams had closed the gap, Stanning and Glover had not yet run out of power.
We got caught up in that moment.
Helen was calling out, "Watch the process, watch the process."
It's really important not to get caught.
We got off to a good start, and we weren't trying to do anything amazing.
We weren't expecting the fireworks to go off today, we just wanted to win the race that we did by rowing well, which we did.
The two will take a year off before deciding what to do with the future.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month; his and television adventurer Steve Backshall's.
For now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It was going to be a lot of pressure.
It took me six months to realize I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was so new and so stressful.
Here, it took about four minutes.
It's a much better feeling."

Bulgaria Announces First Defa Inflation Values in 8 Months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria was at 1% in June.
This is the highest value seen in years (since June 2012), but the first seen above zero since October, after a positive 0.2% value last year.
Average annual inflation measured by CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 – July 2016) was - 0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 – July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 10.0% compared to June 2016, meaning monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate (July 2016 to December 2015 comparison) was - 0.2%, and the monthly inflation difference from July 2016 to July 2015 was - 0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, prices increase was observed in the following consumer product groups: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices have fallen in groups to wear and shoes (2.2%), furniture, home equipment and routine care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco supplies, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; prices remained at the same level in communications and training groups.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says it was inspired by animes for this filter, but some observers say it was racially insensitive.
Snapchat allows around 150 million users daily with the lens tool to change reality to play with their absurd level of identity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character out of a Roy Lichtenstein picture.
Lenses are reckless, feature-changing tools that create over 30 million self-gravitations each day.
The missteps are quickly excavated into the public's memory.
Snapchat lenses had faced accusations in the past that practice supported black classification or offered bleached skin tones as a ideal of beauty.
For this reason, due to the lens they presented this week, which made users bow-eyed, broken teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics criticized the company as being a "Asian mask" that caricatured Asians.
And they wondered if these repeated conflicts pointed to a larger problem with the company's diversity.
News and anger spread on Wednesday with the news of The Verge and Motherboard, and a day later Snapchat announced it had removed the feature.
The company made a statement: The lens had been prepared not for the caricature of Asians, but out of respect for anime characters.
For observers with experience in racism, however, this lens reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Others generally refused to compare it to anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student and tweeted a lot about the photographs, said in an email that the lens was "paintful and uncomfortable with the lightest expression".
"He added that it is difficult to argue when it comes to comparing side by side the effects of the filter with the bad Asian cartoon.
Which suggests that the filter is not only an Asian mask, but also a derogatory Asian mask.
Snapchat is not the only company that has exceeded cultural trigger mechanisms.
American culture appears to be in an endless conflict over diversity and inclusiveness in many areas, from the meeting rooms of institutions to Hollywood and the devices we all carry.
And Snapchat's appeal can also be interpreted as that they may have a higher expectation of sensitivity, with a greater diversity of race than any other.
In an interview Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates a humiliating image for a user, "it is much harder not to notice such movements as they used to be".
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete the Snapchat account and called everyone in that direction.
In his article for Medium and interview on the phone, he expressed belief that the conflicts with race reflect shortcomings about diversity in recruitment practices in Snapchat.
Ms Zhu ended her article with a label, criticizing the company's leader team of mostly white men: #SnapchatiSilin.
Miss Zhu, an American of Chinese descent, said "They can either make such decisions because different races among their staff are not in sufficient diversity, or even though there are people who work there and belong to different races, these people do not feel safe or comfortable enough to speak."
Other observers share his views on this complaint, which Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not share figures related to the diversity among its staff, highlighting the private company situation.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to share racial origins of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently incorporated a recruitment officer in an effort to focus and incorporate efforts to focus on populations that were not adequately represented.
Ms Zhu, in her own way, stated that she would keep her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us who might say that's not true."
The Congressional Panel Says Military Authorities Develop ISIS Intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel reported that United States Central Command Officials had tampered with intelligence reports to draw a more optimistic picture of the events in the field regarding the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
An intermediate report by the Palace's Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and a working arm formed by the Republican board presidents of the Committee on Defense Subject found that its superiors were a "spread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts who said that the American forces had changed the assessments of the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters in Tampa, Fla. that oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A newsletter on the report stated: "The intelligence results approved by senior Centcom leaders typically draw a more positive picture of the U.S.'s efforts to prevent terrorism than the facts in the field show, and consistently offer much more positive results than the analysis of other members of the intelligence community."
Republican Representative Ken Calvert of California said, "What happened at Centcom is unacceptable; while poor analysis is presented to senior decision-making authorities, our fighter troops are suffering."
Leadership failures at Centcom have reached the highest levels of the establishment.
The 10-page report also gave details of the permanent problems in 2014 and 2015, which included Central Command's statement and analysis of America's efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered changes of reports, it is explained that the analysts felt pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic perspective on the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and DAESH.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, declarations and congressional statements were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example; a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack for Mosul's recovery could be carried out as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Kansas' Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement, "After months of research, this matter has been quite clear."
From mid-2020 to mid 2015, the senior intelligence leaders of the Central Command of the United States manipulated the commander's intelligence results to launch the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq as trivial.
Republicans have created a working arm after learning that analysts have expressed concerns that intelligence on the Islamic State has been manipulated.
As the review continues, the report released on Thursday will follow far more extensive findings.
Another Centcom intelligence review, which is being conducted by the Department of Defense general inspector, is also available.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee also published their own findings Thursday which participated in some results that the Republican work arm arrived at.
Representative Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the committee, said in a statement, "From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an extremely narrow-minded process in intelligence assessments on DAESH and Iraqi Security Forces."
According to Mr. Schiff, this process "has delayed the publication of the intelligence results", has led to a demoralization among analysts, and has "not given enough room for opposing views."
However, Mr. Schiff and the Democrats have expressed no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to make up the results of "a previously set or political narrative".
The preliminary results of the congressional review were announced by the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector general review was available following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Senior Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, as a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report during the process of the inspector general's review.
However, he said that "experts may disagree over the interpretation of complex data in some cases and support healthy dialogue with the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defense regarding these important national security issues."
The research will echo beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria continues (this is an argument coined by more and more Defense officials each day).
However, last year's charges have raised the question of how much President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Critics on the reflection of Islamic State intelligence began when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article in which President George W. Bush administration advocated for holding a small force in Iraq despite objections from many analysts and expressed that he had not thought enough about the aftermath of the invasion in 2003, and has been discussed for more than a decade.
Mr. Hooker has also played an important role in the rebellion regarding Islamic State intelligence.
Authorities have stated that despite public statements from Mr. Hooker's team last year, air strikes against refineries held by the Islamic State have built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market, which have concluded that the terrorist group has not significantly affected its financial resources.
However, as The Times stated in September, this finding did not go outside the Central Command.
Centcom's then commander General Lloyd J. Austin III's statement in the Senate last year was criticized by many legislators for being seen as an extremely positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and his replacement to Central Command is General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Women's Grass Hockey Team Prepared to Face Britain Wins its Fourth Victory Backwards
One day after Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6–1 victory over Japan, she scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team in a 3–0 match against India on Thursday.
Although five goals in two games seemed to require a catchy mastery, Bam (27), said he was unsure whether he had done the same thing before.
He said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
What he knows is that Americans lead 4–0 in the Olympic tournament and share the first place in the group with Britain, who went undefeated after defeating Japan 2–0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face each other on Saturday for the final game of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals, and the match will determine who will finish first and second in the six-team group's games.
The team that finished first in the group matches will not face the strong Dutch team, who is the leader of another group, for a little longer when the quarterfinals begin.
However, following Saturday's match, the Americans made a surprising progress here after the London Olympics, when they came last out of 12 teams.
Bam was on this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa.; he was 3 years old when he first picked up the field hockey stick (their twin sister was interested in this sport at Drexel) and joined the national team at age 16, becoming the youngest player on the team.
He missed the 2008 Olympics because he failed to make the final roster.
Then came 2012, when most things were not right for him and his teammates.
The following year, an English coach Craig Parnham was appointed and things began to change.
Bam says, "A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change."
We don't work like London anymore.
We've gone through a complete transformation.
Thursday night, Bam got the first issue of the first half with a close reverse kick.
India had not yet won a win in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly durableness and managed to maintain the score as 1–0 until the third quarter, when Bam stepped in.
He made a long run with the ball from the left of the field and then curled up in the middle, throwing the ball into the goal and putting the Americans up 2–0.
Melissa Gonzales scored the final goal midway through the fourth quarter.
This was the first time United States goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who allowed one goal in the first three victories, did not score in the tournament.
His luck's up.
So is Bam.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place right now," but how good this place is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trambolin Calm in the Middle of Olympic Ambition
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics are going on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro represent an ambitious rivalry and work, and it is as if it will never end or be avoided.
The Olympic torch itself is like a flaming cane transmitted from swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps, and Chad, you can't watch television without hearing something about the conflict between Clos, you can't read a newspaper, or you can't listen to what your neighbor says in a cafe.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, who first participated in the Olympics, may have been one of the names shown during prime time, a dimpled ball, such as a swimmer, gymnast, or fencer, among the sponsorships and TV commercials that advises you to feel better.
However, Mr. Dooley (28) of Lake Forest, California is competing for the gold medal in the trampoline at the Olympics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equally.
Away from the center, there are sports that are partly unknown universally in the shade: air rifle shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have the breaststroke with us, and I wish it was for a long time.
But to make it my personal favorite, I'd like to point out the hidden magic of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been known as an Olympic event since 2000 when it was introduced at the Sydney Games, few people in the 16 years had not realized it was an Olympic sport.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes for its competition, it never won a medal in trampoline and had no contestants reaching the finals until 2012.
In men, the Chinese and Russians tended to share the prizes, and in women, the Chinese and Canadians.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will try to protect the gold medals they received in London this year.
The trampoline, however, is noted as an underdog event, partly because it may be thought that it is worthy of clown school rather than the Olympics in unconscious ears.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert here, I'm just interested.
It has a funny potential (such as the cartoon-like tremor created by the never-ending leap), but it also reflects the elegance of gymnastics and diving, which are basically two sports it brings together.
The word "trambolin" comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means "tramplene".
Champion candidates jump almost 30 feet above the air in a major trampoline, and they are asked to make a series of moves (burking, pikes and flips) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed based on performance, difficulty and "time of flight".
Thirty-two athletes will compete in Rio, 16 men and 16 women from 17 countries.
The most common progress in the Olympics is directly forward.
Those who hope to receive medals, in some cases to the finish point in their search for gold, in some cases back and forth, with up and down movements, must go further, faster and higher.
Not only are they after the finish line or the starting wall, but there is another tough line on television; the world or the Olympic record.
This determined effort is noble, enviable, and even at extreme levels; enough to drown even an audience in tears.
But that's exactly what I find a little exhausting when I'm watching the Games.
The trampoline allows you to take a break from all this.
The ones on the trampoline move upwards.
Their target is not forward motion.
It jumps up, looks weightless like an astronaut, goes up, goes down, and goes back up effortlessly.
Of course, there's not much competition or difficulty, but there's no feverish work to get to the bottom of the routine, there's no loss at a distance, just the elegant suspension of time and gravity, like a dream.
The calmer an Olympic race can be.
Women's rankings and subsequent finals will be held Friday afternoon at 13:00 Eastern time; men again on Saturday at 13.
NBC will air the finals in both days as an afternoon block starting at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic frenzy, they promise a quiet and wonderful moment that can be ignored in the general tumult.
And if consciousness, according to The Wall Street Journal, is to increase by offering male athletes only to gaze and objectify, as the United States male gymnasts have recently proposed, we can say that Mr. Dooley is waiting for his new fans.
"In a Generation Protest" in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. Allied
Protests That Have Violence in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia faced the violent resistance of the government.
Witnesses say a large number of protesters suffered fatal gunshot wounds in a shootout with the police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, he has been a solid ally for the West with one of Africa's most stable nations and its fast-growing economy.
However, anti-government protests in recent months have spread to more and more areas, shaking the country.
Only last week, thousands went out on the street and demanded basic political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response to this was rather brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed numerous unarmed demonstrators.
The protests, thought to be from late last year or early this year, show security officials lashing young people who have to keep their hands up against a wall.
The top U.N. human rights official is currently requesting a thorough review.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to move forward," said Rashid Abdi, project director for the Somali Peninsula of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
After Ethiopia, Nigeria, Africa's population is one of the highest nations and its stability is appreciated by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly Somalia, and there are few countries in Africa that have received so much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing impressively.
Its infrastructure has been effectively improved; even a new commuter train is available in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although the best example of democracy was not exhibited in Ethiopia (human rights groups consistently refer to the government's oppressive attitude), domestic opposition was fairly limited, opponents effectively silenced.
Most of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or banished to the remotest corners of the desert.
However, this may be about to change.
Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from central Ethiopia, said, "If you drown people and don't give them any choice other than protest, these events will happen."
Youth is in full protest.
In a generation of protests.
There are many complaints from the use of land to the pressures imposed by the ruling coalition on power.
Following last year's highly criticised election, the ruling party and its allies also took the last seat filled by opponents, and now can control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions at the border with Eritrea, the pointed and conflicting line that led to the war in June, where hundreds of people lost their lives.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, will be re-armed by taking advantage of this turbulence, which has disappeared over the past years.
There are several factors that explain why the bitter emotions that have been boiling under the surface for years are now exploding.
The first one looks innocent: smartphones.
As cheap smartphones became common and Internet service was provided, only a few years ago, a large number of Ethiopians began to communicate using social media.
Even when the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does during times of protest, most people could communicate through Internet proxy servers that concealed their position.
A few young Ethiopians said this is how they gathered for the protests.
Secondly, solidarity also increased between the Oromos and Amharas, two major ethnic groups of Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not normally allies.
For a very long time, Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian mountainous regions were prominent in politics and business, exploiting Oromos, most of whom were Muslims and lived on flat terrain.
But that changes, too.
Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader, said, "We are gathering under an umbrella and moving towards co-operation."
The largest protests were seen in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Most Amhara and Oromo believe that Ethiopia has been unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which constitute about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third reason behind the unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Mr Meles served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was thought to be a tactical genius who saw what not everyone could see.
Analysts say he specializes in identifying and dissolving opponents, particularly the first signs of unrest.
"The current regime does not have this basic information," said conflict analyst Mr Abdi.
Hailemariam Desalegn, the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, was chosen in relative ambiguity to replace Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he failed to gain the trust of security services controlled by the Tigrayans.
As a result, more fear and more blood were shed.
Ethiopia's last experience of such confusion was in 2005, when thousands of analysts protested after thefts by the government following a sloppy election.
In the measures that followed, many protesters were killed, although less than last month, and this period of confusion also passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning and significant progress in fighting poverty, such as the new commuter train.
However, it is clear that this did not stop the growing hatred of the Ethiopian government.
And it's becoming dangerous and ethnic.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and Tigrayan hatred is also increasing in social media.
Analysts say the protests left the other allies in the United States and the West in a strange state.
The American government was using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia; however, this base was recently said to have been shut down.
Although the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to be torn apart in a fragile region.
Mr. Abdi said "This" and added "it's like walking on a very thin rope."
Donald Trump Explains Obama's Claim That He Created ISIS as "Analysm"
Donald J. Trump tried to eliminate the recent conflict around his campaign on Friday, insisting several times last week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not serious when claiming to be the "founders" of the Islamic State terror group.
This statement raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate openly with the American people.
He also put his deputies, who did their best to defend him in this uproar process, in a strange position during their attempt to explain that this is not what he was implying.
After making this proposition at a rally Wednesday night, Mr. Trump insisted on Thursday, further strengthening his thesis, implying that the president and Mrs. Clinton had actually established ISIS in interviews.
However, in his post early Friday morning via Twitter, Mr Trump said he made only a sarcastic statement.
The post showed that Mr. Trump had taken a full step back from the day before, when he expressed seriousness over this charge in a series of interviews.
Conservative radio programmer Hugh Hewitt reminded Mr. Obama that he wanted to destroy ISIS, and when he tried to help Mr. Trump soften this comment, the Republican presidential candidate said he did not believe it.
Mr. Trump, after the fall in the polls, the latest confusion arose as he tried to change the focus of his campaign.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton had a little talk about economics in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to get back to that.
He again spoke on Twitter, expressing that Ms. Clinton's offers would increase taxes and find his own speech boring.
Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
By late July, after making an appearance suggesting that the Russians should attack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails pirated, she had explained these comments by saying, "Of course I said it sarcastically."
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and step back where needed.
Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who followed the language used by both candidates, said, "It's an order that allows her to "explain" in some way depending on the reaction, by testing how this sees the response of certain messages by those who support her.
But at the same time, he gives these statements on purpose and knows it's too vague to be filtered from different lenses.
After dropping in polls recently, Mr Trump adopted a much more aggressive attitude rather than softening the mood for the general election audience.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed that Mr. Trump was well behind Mrs. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and a tight race was available in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump often avoids apologizing for the provocative things he says, he accuses critics of deflecting his words or not understanding his humor.
However, Mr Trump's jokes, which have been subjected to much more scrutiny during the last months of the presidential campaign, leave his loyal supporters in distress who have to support him in the public, however provocative his comments may be.
Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, as one of Mr. Trump's most prominent supporters, did his best to defend the island in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
When asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's thesis that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, "I think he's making a legitimate, political criticism."
From a point of view, before Obama, ISIS was an unknown, small organization, those who found them cute were completely wrong, and that was due to the withdrawal of soldiers from Iraq.
Most prominent Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Ms. Clinton is doing the foreign ministry, has failed aggressively to deal with the situation in the Middle East and caused ISIS to grow.
Prior to Friday's rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to accuse the news media via Twitter of twisting every word and acting biasedly against it.
He said, "They can't do that!", taunting "poor, pathetic" television experts who are trying to figure him out.
Some Democrats mocked the excuse that Mr Trump had suggested, saying it was evidence that he was not fit for president.
Once upon a time, we were reunited at the Cafe Greenpoint, which couldn't handle Prices.
In Williamsburg, though not offering only a shabby old place with cash, the Verb Cafe Wi-Fi was offering excellent coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, he couldn't handle the prices at his store on Bedford Avenue.
In the summer of 2014, the store that replaces Verb sells Soap Cherie cupcake-shaped soaps.
Residents were close, expressing that this was the last loss of the decentened city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote to Twitter, "New York is change, I know that, but I still can't believe the CBGB is gone and the Chelsea Hotel is empty and Verb is now a soap store."
But New York is a city of reinvention as much as there is change.
Last November, a renovated Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location, to the north.
It has a new Verb Cafe Wi-Fi connection and accepts credit cards but maintains some of its former employees and similar simple air.
Coffee's still good.
The new Verb is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the former cafe, who also owns and general manager of the new place.
He joined Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
He said he would be excited to do so when a client offered him funding for this new place.
Mr. Rodriguez (36), left most things the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for bagels and purchased an espresso machine from the same model.
In fact, old Verb's lights were reused here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he'd like to offer a little bit of experience.
He added new supplies.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are also available on the menu and are offered such ingredients as capers and sautéed onions.
They've got brown rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers fresh juices.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he noticed that the former regulars had begun to arrive decisively.
He said, "Many of our former clients couldn't handle the prices in Williamsburg."
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Miss Oliveira (34) lives in Williamsburg and often went to Verb.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he didn't stop going down this road.
Verb said he stopped drinking coffee for a while after closing.
He said, "I realized that what I love is coffee and culture in Verb."
Now he's drinking coffee again, but the other day, instead of his usual iced coffee, he chose a new addition, a mixture of dew.
Another regular, Tom Rosenthal, went to Verb regularly from 2003.
He used to go there before work and always order the same thing.
"Every day, at quarter past seven, I would walk in without fail and they would prepare my daily order of buttered bagels," he said.
The photo said Mr. Rodriguez wanted to make a change and added new materials to the menu.
Nowadays, Mr. Rosenthal is still taking his usual order, but sometimes he makes some changes by adding bacon, eggs and cheese to his daily bagel order.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wasn't mad at the soap store that replaced the old place.
In fact, Soap Cherie's owners offered to make a special soap for Verb using the cafe's cold brewed coffee.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer."
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also adopted this cafe.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said that he would soon find a space to display this menu so that his new neighbors would also feel good about themselves.
There are other advantages to the new location.
The local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee.
There's a possibility that the cafe will be expanded by spreading to the adjacent building.
For most customers, it's enough to have a new Verb available where they can find their old favorite.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and was very upset after the place was closed.
When the new place opened, Mr Whitt said that it made him feel at home to come in and get coffee.
He said, "I had to smell this."
The Depressive Food of Crisis Time in the book "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, immediately after his seat as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, who was fond of his throat, loved fancy Fifth Avenue foods like goose liver paste and Maryland turtle soup.
That day's menu was much more modest: boiled eggs with tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and dried plum pudding for dessert.
Jane Ziegelman said, "This was an act to form solidarity with those in distress over food."
His wife Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message given to Americans about how they should eat."
Couple living in Brooklyn Heights, food historian.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Mrs. Ziegelman, in her book "97 Orchard", was describing the lives of the slums in the Lower East region through food.
The new book they were working with, "A Square Meal", which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, describes the history of American food during the Great Depression.
They themselves showed solidarity over food, meeting a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Bar, located in the Flatiron area, which had existed since 1929, the year the crisis began.
Mrs. Ziegelman (54), ordered cream cheese and olive sandwiches, while Mr. Coe (57), preferred to sit turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter's roll meatball order appropriate for discussion of Crisis-era meals.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "The salmon were very popular."
It had peanut nuts, liver nuts, dried beans.
They were made from something cheap that spreads material with a material.
Imagine having enough peanuts for you for dinner.
Mr. Coe, he frowned.
He said, "He must be sitting like a bullet in a man's stomach."
In the years before the crisis, especially in rural areas, the tables in America were like buffets.
Women were cooking for men working on the farm and serving freshly baked pies at breakfast, lunch, and dinners.
Americans were sending food to starving Europeans in World War I. "A Square Meal" explains the history of the way the nation dealt with suddenly becoming a center of plenty.
Mr. Coe explained the reason why he and his wife wanted to write about this subject, while saying, "This was a time when food became a central, worrying subject for Americans."
The new budget regime was equally alarming: mysterious foods such as buns and casseroles became a basic consumption product, as Ms. Ziegelman stated, "the moths were a great way to evaluate the remaining foods" so cooks could hide the appetite-covering ingredients below with a creamed sauce coating.
Fresh fruit was replaced by less expensive dried fruit.
Over the years, meat at the heart of American food has become a luxury that has been appropriated.
Interesting mixes have been tested for calorie and nutritional value, and the sense of satisfaction has precipitated taste or general sense of cuisine.
While Ms. Ziegelman was researching her book, including recipes, she prepared a peanut butter-filled onion dish from that period.
"This was not a popular contribution at the dinner table," Mr Coe said.
Mrs. Ziegelman supported it: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing in common with baked onions.
This was a prominent feature in most home economic descriptions.
Home economic experts, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, guided the country's eating habits as never before between 1923 and 1943.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be "designed" and popularized the struggle to turn the paste into delicious foods, such as carrot cream spaghetti.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historic delicious bites.
The way President Herbert Hoover responds to starving citizens of the government, let me eat cake, is extremely appetizing.
On the one hand, he was praising the simple Iowa farmer's food in his childhood, while on the other hand he was eating like the millionaire intellectual he had become.
"He liked to eat European cuisine flavors like fish in salad sauce," Mr Coe said.
He ate his meals in a dining room almost entirely gold-plated, wearing jackets suitable for dinner.
It was far from the truth.
If his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to set an example with his stomach, President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake.
According to the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an assistant who had no regard for flavor, the White House began to offer "not only the saddest food ever prepared, but also the most bleakly prepared plates."
After the country was back on its feet, many of the methods of cooking during the crisis were put aside.
According to Mrs. Ziegelman, understanding and science that focuses on calorie and nutrition continues to apply to cooking.
While writing the book, the couple expressed that Mrs. Ziegelman's mother had learned a lot from her eating habits - for example, she could never throw the food away.
Mr. Coe said, "The waste of food really scared him."
Mrs. Ziegelman spoke of her old memories: "She really made people sick."
There was a case of cream buns.
After the plates were collected at Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe took out a dessert they had prepared at home: the dried plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "It's called whipped prunes," and added that the most frequently applied trick was to give these modest recipes a cool name.
There were no whipped cream; only prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was hesitantly diving into a spoon of brown goo.
Surprisingly, it wasn't so bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third spoon.
Like someone who might have saved money, he told his wife, "I could use a piece of chopped walnuts."
In the fight against Merck's Hepatitis C patent, Gilead will receive attorney's fees
According to the U.S. district judge's ruling, Gilead Sciences Inc earned the right to receive attorney's fees for the hepatitis C patent case conducted with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
After the U.S. judge determined that Merck had committed a series of misdemeanours involving perjury and other unethical practices, Gilead had been waived from paying $200 million in compensation for the violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead's highly successful drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni in June.
At Thursday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman testified that Gilead had the right to compensate for the fees generated during the case defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, a market judge with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other to claim ownership of laboratory work for sofosbuvir, an active substance of Gilead's drugs.
US-backed forces say Membic's control has been taken entirely from Islamic State
On Friday, group spokesman, US-backed forces said the last Islamic State fighters inside the city had taken full control of the northern city of Membic near the border with Turkey.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) are in the process of clearing the city after the departure of a group of remaining militants hiding in the city.
Sharfan Dervis of the Membic Military Council, which is allied with the SDG, informed the Routers that they have released over 2,000 civilian hostages in the hands of militants.
He told Routers, "The city is now completely under our control but we are conducting cleanup work."
The Clinton family earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax of 34.2%.
Hillary Clinton announced her 2015 tax return on Friday, which shows the Democratic nominee for President and his wife earning $10.75 million last year and paying a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent in effect.
In 2015, the Clinton family contributed $1 million to charities, most of them to the Clinton Foundation, former president Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million from speech fees, and the former foreign minister declared $3 million in revenue for his book from Simon & Schuster publishing house in connection with his time at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator, Tim Kaine of Virginia, released his 10-year tax return with his wife Anne Holton.
In 2015 they paid 20.3% federal tax.
Clinton campaign official Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement, "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency".
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses for his promises to reveal his first tax returns and steps back.
Although laws do not require it, it is a tradition for U.S. presidential candidates to publicly submit their tax returns.
Trump and his lawyers, a New York businessman, testified that the reason for the release of the statements was an audit conducted by the Incomes Administration.
In connection with the Democratic candidate's statements, Clinton campaign official Ian Sams tweeted, "You're next."
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release these until inspections were completed.
Criticizing Trump, who was Republican presidential candidate in 2012, also included Mitt Romney and other Republicans, the group expressed that this denial situation posed questions about his self-worth, contributions to charities, business deals, and many other links to Russia.
Clinton went on top of this by releasing an online video Friday showing senior Republicans putting pressure on Trump to explain his taxes.
Thursday, in an economic speech in Michigan, he expressed this problem.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done over the decades, to publish tax returns," he told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump had almost never paid taxes during the 1990s, and on Friday, New York Times business department columnist shared statements by a number of tax lawyers and accountants that the situation may still be going on this way.
Federal tax rates became an important problem in the presidential election.
Clinton presented a rule proposal named after billionaire investor Warren Buffet, which will allow those who earn over $1 million a year to pay taxes at at least 30 per cent.
President Obama supports this offer.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Nebraska, Omaha, the Berkshire Hathaway group, operating there, challenged Buffett to come to Trump and present his tax return.
Buffet expressed that he himself was also undergoing IRS supervision and that Trump was "scared" of voters, not from the tax collection institution.
Clinton published his tax returns in his campaign up to 2007.
The Clinton family, currently living in Chappaqua, New York, has paid an average federal tax of approximately 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate reaches about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton family's statement for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only about $100 of their income comes from wages.
Their main investment is a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clinton family has declared that the savings and interest revenues are $109,000.

The powdered red pepper condoms, the chestnuts, support the protection of elephants in Tanzania.
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from entering human settlements; they throw condoms full of powdered red peppers at them.
The method was proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which found the idea several years ago, and the United States-based Union for Conservation of Nature, took steps to promote it; in villages in northern Tanzania, he began training volunteers to use the nonviolent, four-step method of protecting their homes and crops without harming animals.
Before, most people used spears to defend themselves.
On Friday, World Elephant Day, dedicated to the preservation of animals.
Damian Bell, executive director of Honeyguide, said in a statement, "We have seen that since we developed the set of vehicles, his attitude in these communities has changed; they are now more confident that they can keep elephants off their land without harming elephants."
The first two steps involve holding a flashlight to the passing elephant and honking the horn.
When that's not possible, what's called a "red pepper cloud" is thrown out.
The powder pepper mixed with the soil is placed in a condom with a chestnut flare, with only the end being turned off to remain exposed.
When burned, the condom opens with the sound of an explosion and scatters red peppers into the air in powder.
Even a breath is enough to send the elephants in the opposite direction.
The last resort is to use a catapult that fires fireworks into the air, causing a loud, shiny explosion.
Jewish filmmaker slams hotel in Berlin, removing Israeli telephone code on Arab "telebi" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin caused sensation in the media after it revealed that Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's telephone code and that the employee had suggested "the demands" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, one of the authors of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German broadcaster FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel during his recent stay.
However, the country was not among the states that could be searched directly from the room.
In 2016, in Berlin, the new Germany, how can Israel be eliminated and destroyed?
He did, Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to search Israel via its own call center.
The filmmaker reported the situation to the hotel's reception to get a statement.
Lanzmann wrote that his response "shocked him".
The hotel's secretary testified that this measure was taken by "a deliberate decision by the Kempinski-Hotels administration".
The underlying cause of this movement caused the filmmaker to become much more angry.
According to Lanzmann, the employee said, "Most of our guests wanted the code of Arab and Israel deleted."
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the situation as "a great shame".
We were horrified and surprised.
It's a real shame.
It's a much bigger disgrace that this happened in Germany and in a hotel chain like this.
That doesn't need to be explained.
We expect the hotel to draw the necessary conclusion from this," the official said.
The incident sparked a huge reaction in the online environment; people called it a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of "submitting" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
Another post included the phrase "You should be ashamed", under the emphasis that the hotel was located near a synagogue, on Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel reported that the Hotel quickly dismissed these charges, saying that this incident was a result of "disrepair" and "sorry" from Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung stated that one of Kempinski's representatives said, "There has never been a direct order that Israel should not be included on the fast search list."
And he said they've added the code now.
Police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against Brazilian protesters students
Students gathered in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Thursday to demonstrate against the government's reforms on the public education system clashed with police.
Police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against protesters.
The problem started when the police tried to disband the students, which led to police using plastic bullets and pepper spray.
Hundreds of students attended the demonstration to express their dissatisfaction with the plans.
Less than 100 public schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools, according to an offer made by the governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin.
Some of the people involved in the protest were seen writing against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This last protest took place a few days after protesters went out into the streets in mass to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was dismissed by the vote of the country's senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran rose to 71% - RT Business
Russia's trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown by 70.9 per cent year-to-year, according to Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest of Russian companies doing business in the country has increased greatly, he said.
As new companies prepare to provide access to the market, Russian companies maintain current ties with Iran.
Of course, the increased trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral co-operation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, he said that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by up to 70.9 percent in 2015 compared to the same period and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent, reaching $697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran increased 16 per cent to $158 million.
This increase in trade was provided by machinery, ground vehicles and spending materials for weapons," the envoy said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to arrive in Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran gave Iranian citizens 35,000 visas, mostly for travel.
In addition, Iran was among the top 20 countries to visit Russia for the first time.
We can say that the Iranian tourist record that visited Russia last year will be broken."
At the same time, relatively fewer Russians are visiting Iran; this is a matter that the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization are kept in good condition," he said.
Cash to FETÖ from İzmir - Economic News
Interesting details have begun to emerge regarding Kağuklar Group Board Chairman Abdullah Kavuk and Küçükbay Group Chairman Ahmet Küçükbay, who were detained for providing financial support for FETÖ.
FETÖ's financial resources in İzmir No. 1 and 2 have been determined to send large sums of money to Küçükbay and Kavuk's FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization's ringleader Fetullah Gülen on a regular basis each month.
It has been determined that the money sent to Gülen was not deposited over the banks, but was sent through the courier of the organization.
On the other hand, nine people who were taken into custody as part of the investigation into the FETÖ coup attempt in Amasya were arrested and seven others were released on probation.
In the next 10 years, 30,000 lira is in the pocket.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's call to "take down the interest" has moved the banks.
It had been suggested that banks were included in the campaign attack, which the Estate Housing started first and later joined by GYODER.
The proposal to lower housing credit interest rates to less than 1 per cent, considered a psychological limit, was also made by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
13 banks pulled their mortgage interest below 1 percent.
Public banks started the discount fair.
The latest arrangement, based on monthly interest rates ranging from 1.12 per cent to 1.29 per cent, will pay less interest between $15 and $30 billion, the consumer using a 10-year-term mortgage.
TEN YEARS.
And how much advantage will interest discounts be to house purchases?
A person who uses a $100,000 10-year loan will take an advantage of a drop in interest.
The majority of those using housing loans choose a 5–10-year payment plan.
Interest rates are expected to drop further in the coming days.
Interest reduction will also affect sales.
In 2015, housing sales increased by 10.6 per cent compared to the previous year, with 1 million and 289 thousand.
Sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million this year with a discount on interest.
GYODER President St. Grandson: Should be lowered below 9 per cent per year
Public banks going to interest discounts is an important step.
They listened to our president's call and downloaded the interest.
However, this rate should go below 9% per year.
If this discount process continues, we're thinking of extending the 0.70 interest campaign we started for a few months.
Lamb Group YKÜ Careful Lamb: Our campaign may last for 3 months
The participation of banks in this initiative to bring vitality to the economy, which we limit as a month, could raise the extension of this historic campaign for at least 3 to 4 months.
However, loan interest must go below 9% year-on-year.
It is also gratifying to see that with the positive psychology and unsurprised solidarity that this will only create in the housing sector and the real market, every sector has sacrificed in the purchase of housing for citizens.
Polat Holdings YKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from banks
It's a good step for our president to go to interest discounts on his call to the banks.
Other than that, there are some steps towards the revival of the economy in all sectors.
The NGOs' campaigns, the Central Bank's decision, and all the steps in this direction are for the country...
All the banks need to keep their hands on the ground.
We say to them, come and join the campaign, walk with us, walk the same path, together, hand in hand, to bring the economy to life.
An investment of $5.5 billion in 1.5 years from Sabancı
Sabancı Holdings increased its net profit by 11 per cent in the first six months of this year to $1 billion, 353m in the same period last year, and its sales to $17 billion,166m in the 22 per cent rise.
Sabancı Holdings Overseer (CEO) Victory Kurtulan reported that they invested $1.8 billion in the first six months of the year, and about $5.5 billion from the beginning of 2015 to now.
"As a country, we have been through a difficult turn recently."
"It is now time for our country to work and produce more," he said.
Take a two-year break from Kabataş for the pleasure of the ferry.
Due to "Cabataş Square Regulatory, Transfer Center and Construction of Piers" conducted by İstanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IBB), Kabataş steamer piers were closed to sea traffic for nearly two years.
There will be a modern transfer center on the roughstone beach that will integrate marine, rail system and road transport.
Traffic will be underground, providing continuous pedestrian flow along the coast.
The tram and the funicular systems will continue to work for a while.
Ring campaigns will be launched to allow citizens access to Taksim, Eminönü, Beşiktaş districts.
The interest is down, the house is up
My friend, the manager of a public bank, texted me.
It's always the same thing.
The interest is falling, house prices are rising.
The interest is going up, the house prices are going down.
He says, "That's what happened again."
His job is about individual loans, so it tells him what he's heard.
Contractors who went into a 0.70 interest-rate campaign organised by Real Estate Housing say they have raised prices in many housing projects.
I checked to see if there was any truth.
There's a lack of status, no more...
In the meantime, I came up with a conversation with a contractor who attended our newspaper's construction summit a week after the Fetullahist Terror Organization attempted a coup on July 15th.
The boss of a big firm...
I'm not going to name it after the contractor, and when I heard the words, "Well, actually, prices need to be raised by 10 percent," I said, "Are you going to be a hit-and-run opportunist?"
Following the coup attempt, builders launched a major sales campaign with a 0.70 interest and a 120-month deadline, with a campaign led by Real Estate Housing.
I admit, he put his hand under the rock before the banks, took the risk.
But since we're moving with the spirit of unity and unity not to cut Turkey's pace.
The banks also supported your one-month campaign by reducing interest.
Then no one's going to be an upstarter.
And warn those who do it among you.
President Erdoğan accepts Omar Koç and Ali Koç
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has accepted Ömer Mehmet Koç, chairman of the Board of Directors of Koç Holdings, and Ali Koc, acting chairman of the Coç Holding Board and chairman of the Ford Autosan Board.
Erdogan's admission to the press, which took 40 minutes at the Presidential Council, took place closed to the press.
Call from the BDDK: Complain about those banks
Mehmet Ali Akben, head of the Banking Regulatory and Auditing Agency (BDDK), has issued a statement regarding President Erdoğan’s warning of "recalling the credit" against the banks.
"If banks turn loan recalling into an opportunistic because of the market's conditions, we certainly won't allow it," Akben said.
We say to those who bring us such complaints and information, 'Give name to the bank and company, apply to the BDDK complaint line'.
President Tayyip Erdogan warned the banks yesterday: "I say that a new era will be opened in front of both our country's investors and our banks when interest falls and credit opportunities are expanded."
In this period of our country, I would like to announce that the banks that call back the loans with false excuses, let alone avoid lending, have set a line for themselves.
At the time of interest rates of 7 to 8 per cent per year, banks also made money from these jobs.
More than 500,000 Russian tourists are expected
The President of the Association of Professional Hotel Managers (POYD) Ali Kızızıldag stated that Turkey-Russia relations entered a positive course prior to the July 15 coup attempt at the EXPO 2016 Antalya exhibition site, scheduled flights from Russia to Antalya began, and there was a certain revival in tourism.
"I expect very positive developments from both tourism and agriculture to food, from construction to textile to all sectors," Reddağ said, adding that the meeting of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin excited the tourism sectors as well as their trading sector between the two countries.
Turkey and Russia are very close, we have traditional relations based on years.
"I think that if we, as sectors, are making too fast progress along this path by the leaders of the two countries, we can close the distances and head towards the targets as soon as possible".
Kızıldag said they had predicted that the number of Russian tourists arriving in Turkey would have exceeded 1 million if it had not been for the coup attempt.
But we lost a month in what we call the high season, so there's a reduction in the target.
I still think that if charter flights start, we'll be over 500,000.
There may also be an end to the season, or even an extension to mid-November.
In such a situation, additional flights can also be placed towards Christmas.
I predict that this positive weather will also be well-equipped by the Russian people.
They also have a longing for Turkey.
With this acceleration, I think maybe we can push 700,000.
Citing hope for the Russian market for 2017, Reddağ said that if the two countries' relations as well as the Russian economy recover, the number of Russian tourists could again rise to over 3 million next year.
"There are returns in the cancelled reservations, new reservations are being taken," said POYD President Reddağ, saying with the removal of the public staff's permit ban.
"We have a hopeful expectation of the Day of the Sacrifice".
After the coup attempt, Reddağ expressed that the lifting of the travel ticket sales ban placed by Iran to travel agencies was also a very positive development, saying "It would be very good if we could also bring 100,000-200,000 people from Iran in a month".
Refurbish the current credit?
First, talk to the bank where you get a loan and find out how the new interest conditions affect your credit.
Compute from your bank the cost of using a new loan at lower interest, along with the early payment of closing the loan (as much as 1.5-2 per cent of the usual fee).
If you are still advantageous when you include all costs, you can apply for low interest credit use.
No breathing for the Lion!
The final champion, Besiktaş, aims to enjoy the new season, winning the Super Bowl challenge against Galatasaray.
In a meeting with his students, Technical Director Senol Sun, who had all his plans on winning, said, "We must play pace and aggressively."
He used the phrase "I expect high pass percentage from you and 90 minutes of ball control."
It was learned that the Senol Sun, who did not intend to field the players who missed the training, primarily Sosa, was uncertain about Adriano and Quaresma.
The experienced trainer tried Necip on stopper during practice during the week, but if Adriano plays left-hander, Tosic will serve in stopper.
The Sun, which would also make a choice between Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei, also had his students run a standing ball after a long hiatus.
Tolga will explode - Sports News
Galatasaray President Dursun Uzbek answered media members' questions at the NEF's dinner the previous night, which sponsored Galatasaray, and supported expatriate footballer Tolga Lungci, whose transfer and annual fee were also controversial.
I'M NOT THE FOOTBOLERS TO TALK
Dursun Uzbek, who said that the football team had become much better off than last year, said, "Still, football players should talk about it, not me," and added: "I can't say anything."
Let me see these suits in two or three weeks, then I can tell you our chance to win.
I'm expecting an explosion from Tolga.
You'll see Tolga with his posture, his physique, he'll explode this year, everyone will watch with admiration.
The President of Galatasaray stressed that they had contacted Mehmet Topal during the transfer period but would step in if he did not deal with his club, and said: "We were not meant to be charged so that our opponent could raise the price."
Mehmet Pekal is a gentleman, a gentleman and a gentleman.
If he couldn't deal with his club, we'd want to transfer him to Galatasaray.
RIVA AND BANKA BORROWS WILL END
"We wanted to build a hall of 13,000 people," Uzbek said, saying they would soon begin building the hall next to the TT Arena.
However, our President said, 'Make a hall of 15,000 people'.
We changed the project.
With the money from Riva, we'll pay off the bank debts.
MAYES RETURN US
Galatasaray President Dursun Uzbek, who said he believes his team, who closed last season with the Turkish Cup, will demonstrate its quality in tomorrow's Super Cup final against Beşiktaş, made his claim in a statement that was a slogan at the yellow-red club.
President Uzbek, who said "Mays are ours", said he believed Galatasaray would be the champion again after a year.
The away ban has been lifted
The Club Association Foundation signed a historic resolution at its meeting yesterday.
The meeting, which established the agenda of the July 15 coup attempt, agreed to lift the away ban.
From the new season onwards, guest team fans will be able to take their place in the stands in matches between the 4 seniors and in Beşiktaş-Bursaspor matches.
"We have decided to lift away bans for the continuation of the union and tie formed after July 15th," said Foundation President Göksel Silverdağ.
"We believe that this unity and unity are much more important after the July 15th Martyrs of Democracy," he said.
On the other hand, it was said that the current board would continue its post as a result of a vote at the Club Association Foundation.
The head of the Galatasaray Club, Dursun Uzbek, was elected as the chair of the court.
Contrary to earlier meetings, it was noted that club pennants were not included at the table.
In an effort to highlight Turkey's unity and unity, the table was equipped with Turkish flags.
"We'll clean up our garden"
"We don't have the luxury of underestimating FETÖ formation," Gössel Silverdağ, president of the Association of Clubs, said those who have tried a treacherous attack against Turkey's indivisible integrity had found the great Turkish nation in front of them."
He said, "As a football family, we have to clean and clean our own garden."
"Are you considering an event under the name of the July 15th Democracy Cup?" said Silverdağ, "There is a general opinion of friends who are particularly concerned with the name of the Turkish Cup."
He used the phrase, "We're going to share this offer with TFF."
Target 25,000 combinations
Trabzonspor will compete at his new stadium in the new season.
Master Muharrem, the President of the bordomavilis, who counted days to move to Akdajıl, set combined prices with his survey via social media.
In the new season, fans are expected to show intense interest in the upcoming combinations, which aim to sell 100,000 jerseys with 25,000 combined.
Master President, "The target is 25,000 combined and over 100,000 jerseys."
The poll answers agreed on the back of the wicket and east/west stands.
Good luck to you.
He used the phrase, "You have the ball now."
The Bordo-blue club's new season combined prices were set as follows: "The pen backs bottom-top stands combined prices are $350, and the east upside-down and western stands are $750".
It was announced that the new 150-dollar season jersey would also be given as a gift to combined recipients, while students would receive 30 per cent and 50 per cent off the second combined.

Account-booked fired
F. Bahçe sent Pereira, whom he had signed for two years on June 11, 2015, at the end of the first year.
President Aziz Yıldırım and the board of directors held a meeting, including Tamer Yelkovan, the club's Coordinator for Financial Affairs.
The economic dimension of the event was tabled at the meeting.
Under an agreement with UEFA, Yıldırım, who was sensitive to keeping "annual damage" at a level, reportedly received help from Yelkovan on financial issues.
Pereira's representatives have been contacted.
He's been notified he'll be terminated.
2-2.5 MILLY ESTABLISHING TO HIM EURO
There are still some unresolved points on financial matters, so the official statement will be made today or tomorrow.
Pereira and her team went to practice with the team yesterday because no official announcement was made.
The total cost of this operation was around 4 million euros.
However, it was said that the F. Garden would agree to a figure below that price for termination.
If F. Garden pays Pereira in advance, it will finish the job for a figure of 2 to 2.5m euros.
If Pereira doesn't agree, her salary will be paid monthly.
And if he makes a deal with a team, that payment will be cut.
Yes, Pereira has finally left and the Fenerbahçe fan has made a great revolution.
In the war with Vitor Pereira, Caner Erkin, Luis Nani were martyrs.
Robin van Persie has been slightly wounded.
I'm just gonna be glad Vitor Pereira's gone, and I think our administration will find something worse.
My joy remains with me.
Since Pereira is gone, Fenerbahçe is the champion.
Vitor Pereira, you can pack your suitcase with 3-5-2 and go now.
With Pereira gone, Kadıköy on the 18th.
Serdar Çakır has been dismissed
Serdar Çakır, a top class referee observer at the Turkish Football Association (TFF), was found to have been sacked.
Serdar Çakır, the father of our referee, Cüneyt Çakır, who is currently in the Rio Olympic Games, had sparked controversy in the arbitration community...
Recently, under FETÖ, the boards of Central Referee (MHK), the Board of Inquiry and representatives and observers had been re-created.
The smiling face icon from Van Persie
In the minutes in which Pereira's claim to be sacked, Dutch star Robin van Persie made an innuendo share from his facebook account.
Robin van Persie, who shared photographs of himself from Fenerbahçe practice, put the laughing icon in succession with a football.
This sharing was interpreted as "happy to have Pereira gone".
The first independent gold in history was Al-Deehani's
Fehaid al-Deehani, who won the double trap category in the 2016 Rio Olympics pitching major, brought his first gold medal to independent athletes in the history of games.
In competitions at the Olympic Shooting Center, medals were distributed in the double trap category.
The 49-year-old al-Deehani, who participated in the games with the Independent Olympic Athletes Team due to the penalty given to his country Kuwait, met Italian Marco Innocenti in the double trap category final.
Passing his opponent by a score of 26–24, al-Deehani was the first to win a gold medal with the independent athletes' team at the Olympics.
I opened a door for the headscarf
Doaa Elghobashy of Egypt, who competed as headdress in women's beach volleyball at the 2016 Rio Olympics, said, "I respect those who play in bikinis, and my opponents to their headdress."
Elghobashy said he wanted to break the perception that had settled in the West in recent years about Islamic religion, "I had no problems with my headgear at the Olympics."
Here, athletes struggle with their abilities.
I get positive messages from many countries in the Islamic world through social media.
Especially women say, "You encourage us, we're proud of you."
I opened a door for women in headscarves."
"They understand when I tell them that I'm going out in this outfit as required by my religion," said 20-year-old Egyptian Elghobashy, who told him that foreign athletes sometimes came to him asking why he was wearing a closed dress.
Kazakh Balandin made history

The experienced trainer said, "I have complete faith that friendship will be at the forefront, not only in the field, but in the stands, in these days when we need friendship, brotherhood more than ever."
The assets of FETÖ ringleader Gülen have been seized
In the indictment prepared by Adana Chief Prosecutor's Office for the Investigation of Terror-Technical and Organized Crimes Bureau for providing an unlawfully increased value of non-regions belonging to FETÖ/PDY members and organizations, the charges were filed against Adana 2nd Heavy Penal Court for funding to FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization.
In the case of defendant No. 1 Fetullah Gülen being tried for 'Intention of Attempting to Eliminate the Constitutional Order', the court has issued a warrant for arrest against the fugitives Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu.
However, for the four fugitive defendants who have not been caught and have not come to the hearings, the court has decided that illegal proceedings should be carried out.
The 2nd High Criminal Court of Adana ruled that all assets of Fetullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu who were found in the foreign country to ensure that the case against them remained inconclusive and therefore fled because of their failure to reach him were seized under the "Article of Criminal Protections (CMK)" 278/1.
With this decision, the fugitives' assets, land-sea and air transport vehicles, all kinds of rights and purchases, valuable documents, company shares, safety deposit boxes and bank accounts have been frozen.
Hussein Gülerce: The fall of Gülen depends on the collapse of three feet
Hussain Gülerce, who commented on FETÖ's coup attempt, made striking statements.
From Hussein Gülerce's statements, the beginnings of the line are as follows:
I've been writing in my writings for the last five or six months that they might attempt a coup, but they can't do it in the chain of command.
I didn't know two things: the first being common and profound in this scale, such as the commander-in-chief of the Gendarmerie and the aides of the President.
Mr. President, the person who fought the most, who knows how he paid attention when he chose his aides, but the most important feature of which is a secret that has never been seen.
They're so hypocritical.
One of the most important evidence of "this is not the work of a retired preacher like FETÖ" is that there is such a deep conspiracy.
He's definitely getting support from the CIA.
The C.I.A. took this person too early.
Mahmut Praised in 2014 says they met with Fuat East and Fetullah Gülen at Vehbi Koc's house in 1971.
The people who were most interested in these affairs at the time say that the relations between the MIT and the CIA were the closest.
The U.S. paid for our armed forces personnel, and after they didn't remember, there was one guy.
When do we learn that, in 2014?
After this, there was no explanation for it.
Like Fair Orphan got caught at the base, right?
They're wondering who that is.
Guy's been to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the coup, got back two days ago.
Fair Orphan has been abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you put all this together, this has to be investigated; which one of them went to the United States from March 1999 when they all went to the Fetullah Gülen United States, which one of them went to the United States on an excuse, which needs to be investigated.
It will appear that they have traveled to Pennsylvania on some occasion.
But their real contact with the CIA can be identified here; there have been a lot of people who have been sent to the United States, especially from people who need to be upgraded from within the security.
It's in the Wikileaks documents; it builds a laughing association and it has joint meetings with the CIA.
There were studies 15 years ago to make those contacts with the CIA official.
I told you Fuat Avni was an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The man who works for the Prime Minister's Office works for Fuat Avni.
But what's bad is that this information fell to the CIA as it fell to Pennsylvania.
Gülen's collapse depends on the collapse of three legs; one is what we call a base, which is a friendly ring, there are those in deep hypnosis, even saying that the coup attempt is still Erdogan's film.
I said three legs, one base support.
The theft of questions, the theft, the defeat of civil rights, that was a shock to the base support.
The other two legs; political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing that's going to break political support is documenting the tapes of Baikal and MHP executives being made by FETÖ.
Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu is using "FETÖ" after July 15th and has opened everyone's eyes.
The one who laughs says, "I'm not doing it. I'm doing it."
In front of me, he says, "Oh, Mr. Hussein, these students are having so many different dreams, they're sending them to me, I've banned them, because it's not right to do things with dreams."
A recording had fallen, the speaker on that audio recording was Barbaros Bigkurt: Teacher friends had dreamed, Our Prophet, double the tweets.
One cop has been killed in Nusaybin
According to reports, an armored vehicle with police officers on patrol in Saladin Eyyubi neighborhood has been fired on by terrorists with long-barreled weapons.
In the first fire opened, a police officer was a martyr, and a police officer was injured.
Two terrorists were neutralized in the shootout after the police responded.
The injured police were taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
Operations are in progress in the area.
He kept the couplers busy. The TV broadcasts didn't stop.
Private televisions, which had a significant stake in preventing the coup attempt on the night of 15 July, continued broadcasting in Turksat thanks to a team of technical personnel who heroically resisted the couplers.
That hero Asim Akkaya...
"I risked everything thinking that my friends were martyrs in the fire from the helicopter," Akkaya said on TRT that they had entered resistance psychology with instructions to cut the broadcast during the reading of the statement.
They put a gun to my head and asked me to cut the broadcasts.
I just turned off the local TVs.
Then I got them to move away from the building, telling them we had to go to the satellite dishes.
I spent about 20 minutes in the antenna section.
He said, "Here I cut some wires again, but I didn't touch the broadcasts."
When the couplers failed to cut the broadcast in Turksat, he brought experts of Milky Way TV.
These terrorists were captured by cops who arrived at the scene three minutes ago.
When the couplers returned to the building, Akkaya said that he understood that TV broadcasts continued on the phone that came to them about an hour later, and that he was facing death.
That night, I took over the evening shift at 8:00.
We were in charge of that.
A friend of mine was on call for the E-state and electrical system.
By the time we met for tea around 9:00 p.m., we were on a low flight, and helicopters flew over us.
Around the helicopter were again several more aircraft flying quietly from low.
We saw their lights.
It was probably drones that could get a visual.
They were flying in front of the Helipkopters.
I've been there for 11 years, and it's the first time I've seen a flight this close, so I called the barracks.
Then there was a movement.
When we looked at the news, we found out the bridge had been shut down.
At the time, our head of staff instructed friends who were not on duty at the time to come to the building.
On our way to the barracks to get information, we found out that all your TRT feeds had been dropped.
For five minutes, TRT broadcasts were cut.
I called the TRT main control, but I couldn't reach it.
Our control station said the TRT broadcasts had returned and the memo had begun to be read.
Our Deputy Director, Halil Greençimen, has requested that TRT broadcasts be cut immediately on the general director's orders.
Since TRT broadcasts extensively on 3 channels, we started working to cut the feed.
We've just heard Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım say there's a riot.
Our manager's order to cut off TRT got us into a little resistance psychology.
We cut the TRT, and after a while, we heard a helicopter.
We went out, the helicopter that landed in the guardhouse fired everywhere, everyone scattered.
We hid in a building in the back.
There were 12 of us.
When we got to the back, the soldiers who got off the helicopter came in.
Some of our friends were captured by soldiers.
So we showed up so we wouldn't leave them alone.
That's when I saw them grab our deputy general manager and bring him down on his knees.
The soldiers were talking among themselves.
Someone was saying, "Let's shoot one of them, let them be scared."
Then they put us all inside.
Their commander started screaming, 'Who's in charge here, I'll never ask again.'
And when we heard the "let's shoot somebody" kind of talk, we thought, "We don't know where we're from, but we've been instructed to stop TRT."
So there's a resistance.
That's when I felt like I was giving up my life.
I said, "It's me."
I stood up at that moment without knowing what to do.
All I could think about at the time was that my friends from the helicopter were shot at.
I thought 10 or 15 friends were martyrs in the barracks, and when I thought, 'They're going to kill us eventually', I felt a relief.
The commander in charge said, 'You will cut off all broadcasts except TRT'.
We've got a system division that monitors local channels as they go up to the satellite.
80 of the 200 local stations are coming out of the room in question.
I thought of this room.
There was no national broadcast between them.
If I cut them off and tell them they're all cut off, at least by then the backup will come and help from the outside.
Or it could go as far as it went.
After all, we agreed we couldn't get out of there.
I said, "Okay, I'll stop."
I cut the antenna out of one of the local channel packages.
I cut the power switch to the monitors where we can monitor national channels.
So it would say no signal on all the screens.
I told them I had to go to the antennas so it could be cut completely.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, and one of the soldiers said, "Stay there."
He put the gun to my forehead.
He said, 'You'll cut them all off except TRT, there won't be any left, and I'll shoot one of you eventually, and that'll be you.'
So now that I've had enough of my life, I said, 'You'll see when you're gone, they'll all be frozen', and I said nothing else.
We went into the station, and I cut off the local broadcasts by stalling.
We've moved on to the other antenna.
At that time, I had a system that would correspond to nearly 20 national channels.
When I cut the local channels, about 20 monitors were wasted.
My Lord has helped us, and we were not forced to respond, and He has made their vision strong.
They believed the answers we gave.
They didn't push it.
That's a relief.
After they left the antenna, they asked where the transformer was.
I said, "I don't know, I'm a TV broadcaster." He said, "Is there an electrician among you?"
I said, "No electricians after work tonight. If there's trouble, the team will come."
Actually, there was an electrician at the time.
It occurred to me that I didn't cut off the Cyprus broadcasts.
I was thinking of cutting them off to keep the soldiers busy.
They were a little relieved that they thought the broadcasts had been cut.
They didn't think to look at the literature.
The group's on hold now.
About an hour later, when they turned on the TV in the waiting room, they saw the A News broadcast.
He's in, soldier.
He said, 'My commander A News hasn't stopped broadcasting.'
The commander and I met eye to eye.
He said, 'Get up.'
I'm up.
At that moment, a soldier said, 'There are still broadcasts going on.'
He said, 'There are networks in Cyprus'.
'They're broadcasting over Cyprus, we can't do anything to them.'
He said, "Then he got us all on our feet after writing to someone."
The couplers fled Turksat in a van.
I saw the pictures of the soldier who took me to the bathroom and gave me water and was executed in the seat of that van.
They shot him three times, shot him in the forehead and cheek.
My friends confirmed it was the same soldier.
They called that soldier 'son' with us.
He's probably a soldier.
They could have executed him to get rid of him.
According to Asim Akkaya's statements, the first police team arrived in Turksat from Gölbaşı.
When police teams found out there were helicopters in the vicinity, security guards were being scanned, they returned to the district to get ammunition.
They came back 40 minutes later.
When police teams arrived, Turksat could not see anyone in the outer guard.
"They called on us from the inside, we are Turksat staff, we need to enter urgently," Akkaya said, describing the alleged experts sent from Milky Way TV only 3-4 minutes after the police.
"When the police asked for ID, the four of them rushed to their phones and called in 'We've been captured'", he said.
After the New Door, the Mountainkap spirit
The EC Party will launch a landing in Diyarbakır, Van and Mardin in early September with a broad delegation of businessmen, artists, athletes and opinion leaders to establish "voluntary bridges" with citizens in the region.
The EC Party is preparing to move its "new door spirit" to Diyarbakir following a bloody coup d'état attempt by the FETÖ/ PDYist junta.
The head of the CHP and the MHP will also be invited to the aid campaign in the Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia regions ahead of Sacrifice Day.
The EC Party, which will send a message to the people of the region that "the state and nation are with you", will deliver assistance to the poor families and the needy.
The EC Party's last MyK meeting focused on the Heart Bridge Project, which took place for the first time in Ramadan.
The decision was made to maintain the Heart Bridge on Sacrifice Day, particularly at a meeting assessing the positive results of the project, which was affected by terrorism in the region.
Work has been started under the leadership of Mehmet Muezzinoğlu, Vice President of Civil Society Public Relations.
Accordingly, 12 provinces in the East and Southeast will meet in Diyarbakır, Mardin and Van.
Meetings will be held ahead of the holiday in these three provinces, which have been accepted as headquarters.
The events will include businessmen, artists, athletes and opinion leaders.
At these meetings, the organization of aid and work will be discussed.
At the Feast of the Sacrifice, the delegations of famous names will deliver assistance to the citizens themselves.
Young people and children will receive holiday allowances, and school needs will be met in this way, as schools after the holidays are opened.
Sacrifice meat will be distributed to the needy.
Following July 15th, the air of national unity between the EC Party, CHP and MHP against the coup will also reflect on this project.
The CHP and MHP provincial heads of 12 provinces, including the project, will also be invited to participate in events.
Three parties will be able to conduct relief activities together.
Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) is not considered to be invited to the events as in Yenikapi.
Fair Orphan's father-in-law spoke
His mother-in-law had been taken into custody along with the father-in-law of FETÖ’s Adil Orphan, who was shown as the number 1 attempt at the coup attempt on July 15.
Father-in-law Cevat Yıldırım and his mother-in-law Hatice Yıldırım were released on probation and a foreign exit ban.
Speaking at the courthouse exit, Cevat Yıldırım called for his son-in-law to surrender, saying: "I am with the state."
God damn the couplers.
What I know is, I haven't really known the Fair Orphan I've known for 18 years.
I don't have a son-in-law called Fair Orphan.
I want him caught as soon as possible.
That way he can neither live in Turkey nor in the world.
Let him come and trust Turkish justice.
If he made a mistake, he'll pay.
He's giving us a hard time running away.
It's a shame about the police. It's a shame about the state.
He's been a cop for 20 or 25 days, he's not doing anything else.
"We don't need the coup, we need the work," Yıldırım said, saying he doesn't want Turkey to return to Syria.
We don't want Turkey to go and be like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
There's a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He said, "What do we do with a coup?"
On the other hand, the Orphan, last seen walking through the TEM Highway Akıyek tolls around 3 p.m. on July 19, had disappeared after dropping his 'SIR'-plated vehicle in Akyaz to his father-in-law's garage.

After that, Chipne claimed he would commit suicide by putting his gun to his head.
Chipne gave up suicide, being persuaded by his colleagues and his wife, who arrived at the courthouse.
Detained, Chipne has been taken to County Police Department.
Smoking ban in parks and sports areas

In terms of the future of new generations, he recalled that he and all concerned public institution executives met to sign protocol, wishing the protocol to be good for children and young people.

He saw a setup in Ergenekon, killed FETO
Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating FETÖ's role in the mysterious death of Special Operations Chief Behcet Oktay, whose case was closed in 2009 as "suicide".
Ramazan Akyurek, former Chief of Security Intelligence, who stayed in the same quarters with Oktay and had Oktay heard under the false name as a suspect in Hezbollah Terrorist Organization six days before he died, is the prime suspect in the investigation.
It is suggested that some of the ammunition seized as part of the Ergenekon investigation was stolen and buried from the Special Operations Agency by the FETÖ team at the police station, and that Oktay was killed because of its detection.
Behçet Oktay's death of then Chief of Special Operations Office, who was found shot in the head on February 25, 2009 in Ankara, was called "suicide".
However, there were many questions.
Two years later, this time, a murder investigation was opened as a result of the legal struggle and evidence posed by his family and family lawyers.
Oktay, the left-handed one, had the gun said to have shot him in his right hand.
There were also fractures to the ribs and signs of blunt force trauma to the body.
The case of the murder investigation was filed in May 2012.
In the murder case, only Halil Kesker, who was present at the time of his death, was tried, with traces of gunpowder on his hand.
The cutter was acquitted at the end of the trial.
Nurhan Önder, who was in prison for another crime, sent a letter to the prosecutor and said Oktay was involved in his death, was sentenced to 6 months in prison for "criminal responsibility and misleading judicial authorities".
THOSE WARRIORS ARE ASKED
Meanwhile, prosecutor Hüseyin Yalçin, who called the incident "suicide", retired, while Mustafa Akek, who conducted the murder investigation, was promoted to the Supreme Court.
The Oktay family wants the autopsy prosecutor Nihat Yıldırım investigated along with these prosecutors.
Behçet Oktay's sister Shule Oktay and her brother Nezih Oktay and family lawyers made many demands during the trial process.
The family, who said it was impossible for Halil Kesici to kill the specially trained Oktay alone, asked for an expansion of the investigation.
The family said the incident had been covered and demanded that police officers who wanted to close the case of Hüseyin Yalçin and Mustafa Yaj and Behçet Oktay as suicide be identified and tried.
As the family's demands were denied, it was revealed that Oktay had been heard under the false name "Abdurrahman Right" as a member of the Hezbollah Terrorist Organization six days before he died.
It was determined that Ramazan Akyurek, then head of the Security Intelligence Agency, was the one who made the wiretap.
Following this development, Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, re-examining the Behçet Oktay case, began investigating the finger of the Fetullahist Terror Organization (FETÖ) in the murder.
The case against Oktay's illegal rest will begin on September 19th at Ankara's High Criminal Court.
There's someone else behind him.
The Oktay family, which SABAH is meeting with, is hopeful about the current investigation.
Family members say the FETÖ finger in the murder was covered up during the previous showdown and trial.
Sister Shule Oktay said, "This murder actually showed up."
We didn't get it.
Before my brother was killed, he said, "They're gonna eat me."
I said, "Who."
That's when he pointed to FETÖ.
I thought he was going to be dismissed.
I never thought about death.
Of course the FETÖ is behind this.
"They were in charge at the time," he said.
The martyr called the young man's family, joined his prayer
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has also called the family of Ömer Can Açıköz, a democracy martyr, through AK Party Sinop MP Nazim Mavis, after addressing citizens in the garden of the Presidential Kılliye in the last watch of the previous night, during which democracy seizures were suspended.
At 1:30 a.m. when they were praying for his son, Father Fahrettin Open-Eye stated that he had received a call, "Our President joined with his prayers."
He said, "I said that our country and its health are important to us."
'Our love is important to us.'
President Erdogan addressed the citizens in front of the Presidential Council the previous evening.
Erdogan met with some citizens in Kılliye after his speech, which ended at midnight.
As he walked along holding the hands of an elderly aunt on a democracy watch, he had a conversation with the citizens, cared for the children, and thanked the citizens for their sacrifice.
Erdoğan then called Fahrettin Openeye, the father of July 15 martyr Ömer Can Openeye, through AK Party MP Nazim Mavis.
The father of 21-year-old Omar Can, a TOBB University Law School student who was shot in front of the Presidential Council, Fahrettin Openeye, stated that President Erdoğan called at home at 1:30 a.m. while praying for his son and martyrs, saying, "When I said we were praying for my son, our President joined with his prayers."
And I said that our country and its health are very important to us.
"We are very pleased that our Mr. President called and prayed on the phone," he said.
FETÖ's pyramid was destroyed.
26 FETÖ people were arrested in İzmir Urla.
Among those arrested are Liberation Regent Hepyalçin, who is referred to as the "integration" — the bully — and threatens to end the subscription to the Zaman newspaper.
20 of FETÖ's emmetist older sisters were arrested in Butler.
In Bursa, 24 people including former Bursa Police Commissioner Ali Osman Kahya were referred to the courthouse.
The Doctor's Imam has been captured.
In Edirne, the organization's imam in charge of doctors Aydın Tünbel was arrested.
14 professors were detained at Denizli Pamukkale University, 19 at Alanya Aladdin Keykubat University, 2 academics at Karabuk University, and FETÖ commander Hilmi Sandal at Rize.
8 judges and prosecutors and 2 deputy governors were taken into custody in Diyarbakır.
One of the judges was found to have been held in the courtroom.
In Batman, deputy governor Sener Ages has been suspended.
Two police chiefs have been arrested from 465 police officers suspended in İstanbul Police.
51 in Konya, 14 in Kayseri, 14 in Malatya, 10 in Siirt, 10 in Adana, the provincial imam Naim S. was arrested.
The traitor who shot the people was protecting the PKK
Turkey has been fighting relentlessly to end PKK terrorism for over forty years, and its fight has come to light as to why it could not destroy its leaders.
FETÖ militants who infiltrated Turkey's critical institutions have worked to tie Turkey's hands on all sides.
At this point today, serious suspicion and evidence of FETÖ being behind critical incidents such as the Hrant Dink Murder, the Uludere incident, the Russian plane being shot down began to emerge.
The traitor's got a lot of blood on his back.
During the July 15 coup attempt, it was revealed that the record of the FETÖ Brigadier General Gökhan Şahin Sönmez Fire, who led the raid on President Tayyip Erdogan's hotel in Marmaris and the assassination operation, was very high.
It had previously been determined that Sönmezfire had reported air operations to the PKK to terrorists as the planes took off.
And the investigation by intelligence agencies found Gökhan Sönmezfire's record to be high.
CONTROL OF TEERISTS
In addition to leaking intelligence to the PKK, it also came up that Turkish warplanes did not fully hit the targets set.
The point given by MİT in the Kandil foothills regarding the leader squad of the PKK has been alleged to have been deflected by Gökhan Sönmezev and prevented the shooting of targets.
By changing the coordinates, it was determined that the PKK's warplanes, which took off to destroy the leader's squad, hit places on the side of the targets, and so did the leaders of the terrorist group.
The intelligence review found that Sönmezfire played a key role in both deflecting targets and escaping PKK terrorists from their location before the F-16s took off.
Opening files of 37,000 officers
Reconstruction process was initiated in the TSK and the Ministry of National Defence after the coup attempt of FETÖ members was repelled by instructions from the head of the terrorist, Fetullah Gülen.
A comprehensive cleanup process was initiated, especially when it became clear that the questions of entering military high schools had been stolen by FETÖ, that non-regular military students had been discouraged and sent from schools.
With the final discharges, nearly 37,000 officers will be left with 39,287 officers, while the cleanup for generals and admirals will also be carried out for these officers.
For this, promotions will be frozen, especially in staff from lieutenants to colonels.
A thorough investigation will be completed before the promotion.
The files of 37,000 officers began to be opened one by one.
A full-blown study will bring out the FETÖ soldiers.
Officers without ties to the FETÖ will continue their duties.
The fight will continue until the last FETÖ man from the army is cleared, while the promotion of officers will only be raised following the investigation.
The MIT, Security Intelligence and State Audit Board are conducting the investigation together.
As part of the investigation, it is being investigated whether the officers whose files have been filed have been ranked, promoted, served, and their commanders, whether they have finished civilian or military school.
It will also be investigated by a study that has injured the hair of whether or not they are members of the FETÖ, even through their arrangement.
Any measures will be taken to ensure that officers with no ties to the FETÖ are not adversely affected by the process.
If there is any doubt, that officer will be suspended immediately and referred to the court.
Those who have been identified with FETÖ connections, those who have information and documents about them will be immediately cut off from the military.
While promotions are frozen during all of these proceedings, the review will be deepened.
Further measures will be taken to ensure that there are no gaps in the post-export staff.
Those who were expelled from the TSK by the FETÖ conspiracy and those who were forced to retire will be able to return to their professions with the same rights of self-image in the equivalent squads and their circuit mates after going through the security investigation if they want to.
2 THOUSAND 133 SUBAS REPORTED
The Joint Chiefs of Staff had announced the number of staff of the TSK as 39,287 officers on July 1.

However, in the first wave exports on 27 July, a thousand 99 officers had been dismissed, including 726 of them Kara, 314 of them Air, and 59 of them in the Marine Corps.
In the decree on July 31, a further 1,04 officers, including 125 of them Kara and 909 of them Gendarmerie General Command, had been cut off from TSK.
Pehlivanoğlu: Taşleş has been poisoned by FETO
Retired Superintendent Tahsin Pehlivanoglu, the founder and first chairman of the MHP, of Alparslan Türkesh's bodyguards, suggested that Turkesh was poisoned and that someone in the family had done so in collaboration with FETÖ.
Pehlivanoğlu, who was with Turkesh at all times from 1977 until 1997, said, "I haven't told anyone until today, but I had to talk to him after I saw the image of that soldier pulling pieces out of Muhsin Sıyıroğlu's helicopter and saw that the same soldier was in the coup attempt to kill our President."
Here's what Turkesh's bodyguard said:
We went to Germany in 1997.
Three days before we arrived, we had a checkup on the chieftain.
33-year-old Burdur doctor Fikret, doing a checkup, said, "You look like an 18-year-old."
He said, "You've got nothing."
This doctor died of a heart attack for some reason a month later.
We returned to Ankara on 3 April.
My thumb has gone to Amasya.
They called me on the way back and went to an engagement in Ankara Hilton.
After exiting the engagement, Turkesh tells driver Alparslan, "Open the back window".
There's no way he'd open a window.
When I open the window, there's a sound.
First they did CPR, electro at the Cankaya Medical Center, but it was over.
We took him to the Public Works Medical Center together, but it was too late.
I think someone in the family poisoned him in Amasya.
Turkesh hasn't had an autopsy.
His ex-wife, Seval Turkesh, will have heard my illness and rhetoric, which has come out to defend "Turkeş has been killed" and so forth.
One makes a grave, one makes a grave.
They called it a heart attack.
Turkesh's tomb must be reopened.
Alparslan Turkesh was killed?
They were arrested smuggling gold to Pennsylvania!
The operation for the construction of FETÖ/PDY's businessmen in Izmir seized the unique gold of 5 pounds during its shipment to Pennsylvania.
The operation conducted found that calls to the workplace found another 30 kilos of unique gold waiting to be smuggled to Pennsylvania.
Following the gold prepared to be sent to Pennsylvania in Eldem Jewelry, the workplace of businessman Mehmet Eldem has been arrested and sent to prison.
Also detained businessmen Mustafa Özkara, Ezel Elected and Electoral Electoral have been arrested in the operation launched in İzmir.
On July 29, İzmir Provincial Police Directorate Directorate of Anti-Criminal Crimes Department members launched an operation in which Ezel Elected and Electoral Elected detained Ezel with Mustafa Özkara as chairman of the Board of Directors of the Federation of Industrial and Businessmen of the Western Mediterranean (ÖSIDEF) and the owners of Western Transit Transportation Oil and Tur. Tic. Ltd. Şti. (BALPET)
While trying to escape to Kyrgyzstan, SEDEF President Ozkara, who was captured at İzmir Adnan Menderes Airport, was determined to be the son of Osman Gürbuz Özkara, who was part of Fetullah Gülen's first board of trustees, and was one of the most important figures in FETÖ's Aegean Region.
It had been reported that 5 fuel stations owned by other businessmen Ezel and Electoral Electoral had been seized for allegedly providing financial resources to FETÖ.
They stole a car in an hour and robbed three gas stations.
It happened the other night on Eagle.
Two suspects, who came to Eagle in the vehicle they hijacked, first robbed another gas station 300 meters ahead of a gas station located on the side road, then another station on the side road with a gun.
Alerted after the robberies, Eagle police quickly identified the suspects and launched a capture study.
Police teams have tracked down the vehicle used by C.S. and U.A.
Indictees began to get out of the vehicle they were using in the direction of Eagle Square, while shooting at police.
One of the suspects, who continued on foot, was caught loose on the Avenue of Sovereignty.
The police quickly apprehended the second suspect, based on information from C.S.
The suspects were arrested and sent to prison following their proceedings at Eagle Security Bureau.
On the other hand, the masked robbery was recorded by cameras.
In the footage of the gas station's security cameras, the suspect first enters the gas station, then enters the market wearing masks and taking weapons in the vehicle outside.
There's a struggle between the first suspect to enter the market and the market employee first.
The other person found next to the suspect, who was attacked by the store employee, walks in with the mask and the gun on his head.
The suspect, who drew his gun, flees with $6,200 in the safe after disarming the employees.
The suspects' top searches have recovered approximately $15,000 from 3 stations, an unlicensed weapon, and the vehicle they hijacked again.
7.2 magnitude earthquake in the Pacific Ocean
The U.S. Center for Geological Studies (USGS) announced that the earthquake 109 kilometres east of its epicenter, New Caledonia Island, was recorded 10 kilometers deep in the seabed.
The tsunami warning after the earthquake, which did not cause loss of lives and property, was soon cancelled.
An earthquake often occurs in Vanuatu, which is part of the "Pacific Ring of Fire" earthquake belt.
He prayed for martyrdom unaware of the coup.
On the night of 15 July, the relatives of 38-year-old Çetin Can, martyred at the Boğaziçi Bridge, remain steadfast.
His wife Fatma Can said that while they had yet to know about the coup attempt that night, his wife had learned "the prayer of martyrdom during the Sabbath" in a conversation, after which he had performed the prayer of martyrdom at home, and advised her to perform this prayer.
Following the prayer, Fatma Can told us that they were watching the news from TV at night and that they had learned about the coup attempt:
We got ready and left together.
When we got to the bridge, there were people waiting.
As soon as we got on the bridge, the tank fired twice on us.
We took cover, then we kept walking when the tank left.
There was a point on the bridge where a big bus stopped.
It was too crowded.
We stood there for a while, waited.
When we couldn't move forward, we thought, what should we do?
Çetin wanted us to go next door.
I'm guessing that when we hit the side lane, we became an open target, and he was shot.
And after he had prayed, he prayed and was a witness.
He didn't know about the coup.
It is the wisdom of Allah.
It is God who gives, and God who takes.
My wife once said, "If I die, plant a tree that brings fruit to my grave."
I made that wish by planting a plum tree over his grave.
Fatma Can noted that they also owe President Erdogan thanks for visiting them, saying "God bless him".

On the night of 15 July, FETÖ couplers were revealed to have fired on the mosque to silence the sala from the mosque next to Raider Base.
SABAH has reached a statement made during the mosque's imam's complaint "on behalf of the holy ones" with footage of the attack on TAI TUSASH Mosque, its nearest mosque to Raider Base.
According to reports, the couplers began firing, aiming directly at the loudspeaker at about 50 meters after they began to be read on rafts in the mosque.
One of the bullets hit the edge of the speaker and four hit the toast.
When the couplers failed to hit the speaker, the raft from the central system was read to the end.
According to the crime scene reports, the couplers who broke through the mosque's door with the intention of killing the imam walked in with their boots.
"I'm not hurt, I can't complain personally, but I want these villains who can shoot at the mosque and martyr the people of Kazan to be punished in the most severe way," Cami Imam Mustafa Sugar said in his statement.
They killed young people at the festival.

On the Left, stating that reports of prisoners wanting to meet the guard were being examined when they found out that they were being sent to another building prior to the incident, investigators stated that they were investigating whether the explosion was part of an escape attempt.
Police official Jose Carumba, in a statement to the local press, reported that the guard had fired on prisoners after hearing shots, after which a grenade exploded in the vicinity.
Curumba noted that authorities were investigating how prisoners who shot the guard had smuggled the gun into the prison.
The explosions in Thailand
Three people were killed in explosions in four cities in southern Thailand.
Officials said 3 people were killed in the explosions in Trang, Hua Hin, Surat Thani and Phuket, 35 others including tourists were injured.
Police Spokesperson Piyapan Phingmuang announced at a press conference that the bombings were not linked to terrorism.
Phingmuang said, "Tayland has no regional or religious problems with anyone."
He used the phrase, "We think this is an act of internal sabotage."
Junta leader Prayut Bell-oça also told reporters that he did not want to comment on who was behind the explosions.
"We need to focus on ensuring space, peace and trust," he said.
Last year on August 17, 20 people were killed, 120 injured in a bomb attack near Erawan Temple in Rajprasong, the commercial headquarters of the capital Bangkok.
"Sleeping Cruel" will be executed with a lethal injection
In the United States, 63-year-old Lonnie David Franklin, nicknamed "Grim Sleeper" (Sleeping Cruel), who was arrested for committing at least 10 murders over many years, was given the death penalty.
Franklin, a former cleaning worker, was targeting prostitutes and drug addicts in his murders.
Judge Kathleen Kennedy, who was judging Franklin, told the accused, "I've never seen anyone commit such monstrous and cruel crimes in my life."
Franklin is said to be one of the most bloody killers in California's history.
It has been learned that Franklin, convicted of deliberately murdering 10 people and attempted murder of one person, will be executed with a lethal injection.
Prevention against FETÖ in Macedonia
Macedonian Minister of State Furkan Cako said the FETÖ's extensions in their countries have also taken steps to be unearthed from a legal standpoint and to launch investigations that need to be launched.
"All of this is known in the public opinion," he said, reminding that the organisation also has media and business activities in Macedonia.
The Turks here no longer give their children to FETÖ schools.
So we call on our people not to send their children here anymore.
"This structure, which had previously benefited from public hospitality and gratitude, is well known to the public".
The sky will be the scene of meteor shower
TÜBİTAK National Observatory Researcher and Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences at Istanbul University Professor Dr. Hasan Esenoglu told AA correspondent that Perseid will reach its highest level on Saturday (August 12th).
Esenoglu said thousands of pieces of sunlight and gravity would break away from the comet "Swift - tuttle", creating a rain of Perseid meteorites, adding that this would become a natural visual feast.
Esenoglu stated that the Perseid meteorite was first discovered in 1862, and that from the 1990s onwards, it began to be seen again in the world.
"We need to watch, take care of such a visual feast from space," Esenoglu said, saying that the Perseid meteor shower can be watched in July and August.
After all, it's a natural visual feast.
"It will contribute to us getting to know the universe better".
They'll be red when it's cold, white when it's hot.
Esenoğlu continued, noting that some of the fragments that were broken during the meteor shower would fall to earth the size of a lentil.
Perseid temperatures can increase to 2,000 centigrades.
Because of the heat and friction in the atmosphere, Perseids produce red light while it is cold in the natural environment and white light when it is hot.
It can be contributed to science by writing on the website of the International Meteor Organization how many asteroids have been seen.
This data is worth information because it's collected from all over the world.
♪ Can be watched all night ♪
Recalling that the meteor shower is moving at about 60km per second, Esenoglu said that this visual feast in the sky can be watched better all night from places with little light in the northeast direction.
Esenoglu said more than 100 meteor showers occurred a year, and after the Perseid meteor shower, on December 4th–17th, Gemenid noted that the meteor shower was a nature event worth watching.
Undereducated, former footballer Erdogan
If this upsets the balance, it was the winning alliance of Fetullah Gülen, a widely religious entrepreneur with populist Islamists led by undertrained former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his highly educated followers, who founded over a thousand schools, dozens of universities and educational institutes from Texas to Taşkent.
The above is a translation of the sentence from an article in Foreign Policy last week.
Erdogan, a university graduate, is undereducated and former football player; Gulen, a primary school graduate, is described as a wide-ranging entrepreneur, and these and similar articles are frequently featured in the Western press, where his Gulen followers are openly praised.
After that, they are trying to explain in their article "Why is America and/or Western opposition rising in Turkey?", which begins with the phrases "Because Erdogan...".
It is possible to think that analysts who view the Western opposition in Turkey as a neurotic situation during Erdogan's time are unaware of Turkey's history.
In fact, according to statistics, the first decade of the Erdogan era can be read as a period in which Western opposition in Turkey has declined or remained on average.
Because over the course of this decade, there were good relations with the European Union and with the United States in sync.
Erdoğan's base attitude that 'one-minute' and Israel were criticized, that the Assad regime in Syria failed to establish a clear policy after civil war broke out as a result of the massacres of the Assad regime, and that some figures such as President Schulz of the European Parliament won Turkey alone in the refugee crisis with a poem in which expressions passed through the refugee crisis, that "We are not dealing with Erdoğan", that led to a blasphemy contest in Britain, and that was then the Mayor of London, the Secretary of State of State, that now has been able to imagine, and that Turkey has been forced to fight against Syria with the Syrians, and the Syrians, including the Syrians, and the Syrians, and the Syrians, who are responsible for the Syrians, and the Syrians, and the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, who have been forced to fight against the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the rebelss, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the rebelss, the rebelss, the rebelss, the rebelss, the rebelss, the rebelss, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the rebelss, the Syrians, the rebelss, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the rebelss, the rebelss, the rebelss, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the rebelss, the rebelss, the rebelss, the rebelss, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the rebelss, and the Syrians, the rebelss, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the rebelss, and the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, and the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the rebels, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, the Syrians, and the
Let's just say that as we lose 247 people as a result of the bloody coup, we forget that no support for our democracy has come until the so-called EU countries and the United States prove that the coup failed, that Kerry expects the construction of 'peace and stability in Turkey' in his first address, that he has made no emphasis on democracy and the elected government.
How will it be forgotten that many leaders from the world, including Turkey, participated in the protest march because 11 Charlie Hebdo employees were killed in Paris, but that no president from any Western country, who was 'allied' to Turkey, had not come a month ago, although 247 attempted coups that resisted tanks for democracy?
What are we going to say about sending low-level representatives to the presidents or senior representatives who come several times a year for the refugee issue?
How do we assess the fact that all EU and U.S. ambassadors visit the bombed-out Turkish National Assembly for breaking the window?
If it is remembered that the EU shook hands with coup leader Sisi in the first two weeks of the coup d'état in Egypt, glorifying coup management by saying 'democracy is being rebuilt' during Kerry's visit following the coup d'état, is it so unusual for Western countries to express their concern for Turkey's democracy at every turn?
Even allowing Gulen to live freely in the United States, which 95% of the people consider to be responsible for the coup, is currently enough to drive the Turkish people crazy.
If the background I'm counting above is added to this, I think it's clear that the rising West/American opposition is simply unexplainable with Erdogan.
Besides, Erdogan hasn't even said he still thinks there's a U.S. influence on the coup...
So the trunk was never a setup.
Can Travelheads, who despise their own people, say, "The Ark is a draft", insult voters who don't think like themselves as "the ignorant who scratch their stomachs", play the same tune after the night of July 15th?
After seeing how these people took care of the state and democracy, did they look for answers to the question, "Where were we wrong?"
But there are so many questions that need to be answered.
Officers who served in various ranks until yesterday to become traitors and were given the right to use the weapons of the state, suddenly agreed to enter the status of "the traitor" and sought asylum from foreign states.
We need to see what kind of mental warp we live in, and how obsessions with individuals lead people to behaviors that would be characterized as perversions.
As for the watered brains, the attempted coup d'état...
For those involved in this action, did Turkey have any perspective other than to liken its cities to Syria's cities?
Why would an officer bomb his own country's parliament?
We probably shouldn't have made the mistake of waiting for reasonable behavior from brains watered by FETÖ's curses.
But let us know that the FETÖ isn't the only one responsible for everything.
The cadres who present politics as a profession of fighting, hatred and hatred have also made necessary contributions to the tragedies that have happened.
Those who offer themselves as "The Light" have also led the masses to believe that all kinds of illegal behavior and even vulgarity are natural.
We've seen how those who hate their own people, when they're given a gun in their hands, they even open fire on this ring.
The way of democracy, the way we know it
I say one simple thing: On the evening of July 15th, the people in Turkey gave 250 martyrs to the FETÖ soldiers, to the pilgrims, to the pilgrims, to the sergerdes, and more to build democracy than to save it.
But behind July 15, there are three terms: 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012; and after.
There are three changes prepared during these three periods: economic, social, political.
The social change prepared two major phenomena: metropole migration from the rural area and moving these nomads to the centre after being kept around cities for a very long time.
On Wednesday, I stated that this move was through the subway.
I also emphasized that it was the most important element of social change to call it a subway.
The second major change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
The contribution of the road and bridge to modernization is easier to understand.
The road comes, the economic and social structure changes.
In our case, it's changed a lot of political structure.
I've found this date in Istanbul with bridges over the Strait.
Demirel built the Strait Bridge.
This was the peak of the post-1950 peasant movement in the 1960s.
Özal continued to advance in the same direction with the second bridge, now renamed the July 15 Martyrs Bridge.
Even their pathways indicate the relationship between the environment and the center.
It's a sign of what kind of social change course is being followed.
The purpose of Demirel and Özal was to melt large masses in the center.
It was to adopt the ideology of the center.
The EC Party has not built the third bridge for many years.
Because the migration was going all the way.
The people who came were placed in satellite cities.
A little closed system was created in those areas.
Local governments from the EC Party gave people access, jobs, social status, and they voted for the EC Party.
So the masses were not asked to melt in the center, but to acquire their political consciousness in the environment, and then come to the center as 'they themselves'.
This formation was related to ongoing headdress discussions (1992–2002) prior to the AK Party.
These debates allowed the masses to accept the obligation to stand side by side, not to join with the center, but to the conservative, the resident and the provincial people.
The EC Party acted in the way I stated after 2002, politicizing the masses, bringing them into politics, bringing them into maturity.
Following these, notice now, the democratic struggle on July 15 with the construction of the 3rd Bridge is simultaneous.
So, history and sociology are consistent.
Let me add another dimension: the move by the EC Party is not limited only to the Istanbul bridges.
The more interesting thing is that the EC Party now integrates the surrounding cities into central cities.
This is provided through two bridges.
One, Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, the Çanakkale 1915 bridge.
Add pathways to that.
Turkey will now reach another route from Thrace to Izmir.
You know what that means, Izmir will be a different city from now on.
Let's say the EC Party is going to take Izmir from the 'inside' now from the 'outside'.
Now Bursa, now Çanakkale, now the cities of Thrace will become other human and social geography.
That's it!
The martyrs of July 15 are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie in Fenerbahçe and cheerful practice
Fenerbahçe continued his preparations for the Grasshoppers game with practice during the morning hours.
The practice, which began at 10 p.m. under manager Vitor Pereira at Can Bartu Facilities, lasted a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of core practice in the hall, players went out into the field, scoring 5–2 fumbles and passing with running and warm-up moves.
The practice was completed with double wicket matches in the narrow space.
Fenerbahçe will continue his preparations with his practice at evening hours today.
The one who complained to St. Lightning's Smiler...
There are new developments in Operation Fix-up against Fenerbahçe.
"A name from the sports world has brought up St. Yıldırım's words to Fethullah Gulen about him," journalist Hussein Gulerce, who participated in a programme broadcast in CNN Turk and explained that this operation was conducted by FETÖ."
"One day on the plane, this person said, 'What are you doing with Fethullah Gülen?"
When this person passed these words on to Gulen, Fethullah Gülen became obsessed with Aziz Yıldırım.
Why is he obsessed with St. Lightning?
The president of the club, who is Turkey's biggest fan, feels that he could hurt himself in this mentality.
He had used the phrase "The case of the complaint was to liquidate St. Lightning".
Following these remarks, a statement came from Faik Işık, one of the key lawyers in the Case of Fixing.
Light went on the Opposite Opinion program aired in Habertürk and announced the person who complained Aziz Yıldırım to FETÖ ringleader Fethullah Gülen.
Here are the words of Faik Light:
Aziz Yıldırım is saying something to Ihsan Kalkavan about Fethullah Gülen.
On a private plane from Azerbaijan.
The saint is a witty man, and when he criticizes someone, he also says it in westernist sentences.
Maybe those western phrases will bleed a little.
Some may react to those sentences.
These sentences are being brought up somewhere.
Towels, Himmets, all these businessmen going there like they're going to Umre in Hajj, that's not acceptable.
What do they call it, he's critically critical.
Of course that's not the only problem.
By the way, there's also a football team tryout.
Direct links of some football players and executives from the Galatasaray Club and Hakan Thank God...
Master Muharrem: The matter of the fix is different
The head of Trabzonspor, Muharrem Master, extended his hand to Fenerbahçe.
"We are on the side of this country with $79 million," the Master said, expressing that Turkey's issue is the issue of all clubs.
We need to take a good stand.
If Fenerbahçe has a problem with FETÖ, if it's unfair, I'll stand behind Fenerbahçe.
"However, the issue of the fix between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe is different," he said.
Sacrifice prices have been announced
"As a unit, we've set the weight price of the live sacrifice calf at $18," Karabulut said.
He said, "We've also identified the heifer price at $17 again, $17 again, and 15 lira again, the live kilogram price of the cow we call second class."
Noting that animals that were not going to be victims last year were also being put up for sale, Karabulut described what citizens need to pay attention to when they are being sacrificed:
Especially animals need to be careful with ear earrings.
It's also important that the animal is healthy.
That's why they can check the vaccines on the animal's passport while they're taking victims from our citizens.
And from the outside, the victim must be alive and alive, and he must have shed his feathers.
And you shouldn't have any signs of saliva or snot on your face.
Over the past few years, we've seen non-victim animals sell and sell.
The animal that's a sacrifice has to be 2 years old.
We can tell by looking at the animal's teeth.
A two-year-old animal has got teeth that we call a cap.
But the animals, who are younger, don't have these teeth.
The animal may look large in image, but it may not have fangs.
Cover teeth are also immediately noticed as they are already larger than others.
Rize Airport to be built at sea
The second airport in Turkey to be built with a naval filling will be Rize Airport.
Rize Airport will be built on a naval filling between 266 hectares in the 266 hectares between the village of Greenköy and the location of the Tower of Girl in Sunday district, between 26 and 32 meters from the coast.
Due to the high depth in construction of the Rize airport, nearly three times more filling materials will be used than used at the Army - Giresun Airport.
As part of the project, apron will be built with a 50-foot-long and 3,000-metre-long runway, where 36 aircraft will be able to land and take off at an hour.
Rize Airport, which will generally serve passengers and cargo aircraft, is also expected to serve composition class D, turbulence class heavy, takeoff weight of over 150,000 kilograms.
The first stage for the Rize Airport project, which will be tendered by the Department of Transportation Maritime and Communications Substructure Investments Directorate, will include sea filling, track, apron, instalment, freeway, safety fence, bank, PAT fields and environmental lighting.
This is going to cost $600 million.
Following infrastructure work, there will be a 150m-dollar expense and a superstructure that will cover terminal buildings.
The construction of Rize Airport will be completed in 2 years and 9 months.
Eight cents an increase in your bike
The fuel distribution companies averaged eight cents on the litre of their engine, effective from midnight tonight.
According to the Oil Products Employers' Union (PUIS), an average price increase of 8 cents will occur on the litre of its engine starting August 13, 2016.
According to this, an average of $3.68 per litre in Ankara will increase the price of its engine to $3.76.
The price of his engine will increase from an average of $3.63 in Istanbul to $3.71 and an average of $3.66 in Izmir to $3.74.
Due to the prices, competition and freeness set by the distribution firms, it is able to vary in small-scale proportions to companies and cities.
Last week on Friday, the fuel delivery companies had raised the price of their engine by four cents.
Here are the Galatasaray footballers in Gülen's chat
At one point, it was revealed that Galatasarayan and national footballers, who marked Turkish football, were involved in the 1996 chat of FETÖ ringleader Fetullah Gulen.
Among the footballers who heard Fetullah Gülen's conversation in 1996, Hakan Ünsal, Mert Korkmaz, Okan Buruk, Arif Erdem, Ismail Demiriz, Uður Tobacco and Yusuf Tepekule are clear.
In the conversation in question, Gülen used the phrase "We scored four goals and won", mentioning Galatasaray.
Said Alpsoy, known as FETÖ's former football imam, recently told the SABAH newspaper, "When Turkey became the third world in 2002, the team was handed out bonuses."
Emre, Okan, Hakan Thank you, Hakan Ünsal and Arif raised money from these premiums.
The sum raised was $250,000 or $500,000.
Arif Erdem took this money to Pennsylvania.
"Smiler later gave Arif the eulogy."
The national footballers have joined Gülen's conversation!

Suspects Ertekin and Bashan have been taken to the police station.
Very striking statements about the FETÖ from Robert Amsterdam!
Robert Amsterdam, an official of the Amsterdam&Partners law firm, who investigated the international illegal activities of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization (FETÖ), wrote an article to the U.S. magazine Forbes, sharing information on how FETÖ was organized.
Noting that FETÖ ringleader Fetullah Gulen led the organization from his estate in Pennsylvania, Amsterdam stated that Gulen would "see clearly that the organization has hidden advanced organizational ability underground, if you look closely at how it operates about 150 contracted (charter) schools in the United States."
Amsterdam quoted it as being tasked by Turkey seven months ago to investigate Gülen-related companies and schools, stressing that what they have so far found is "shocking".
Amsterdam cited the following views in his article:
According to the information revealed to us, the Gülen organization has a strict hierarchy of instructions.
These instructions are usually delivered at meetings with Gülen face-to-face in Poconos.
There's a seven-person management group on the hill.
This group relays instructions to the advisory committee.
Instructions go from here to regional imams, country imams, region imams within the country, provincial imams, district imams within provinces, neighborhood imams, student homes (light houses) and students respectively.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers work at different levels according to their positions and support within the organization.
Amsterdam, which quoted the organization as opening 55,000 business places worldwide, having the largest contractual school network in the United States, reported that millions of dollars were given to these schools annually from taxes paid by American taxpayers.
Amsterdam wrote that most of these coins were directed among themselves and transferred to "selected" subcontractors.
Amsterdam explained this procedure with the following examples:
In California, the established Magnolia schools were caught giving $700,000 for an annual service contract to the company, which was Gülen affiliated and shared the same office.
Amsterdam cited the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma as another example.
Amsterdam noted that this school also paid the property owner an extra $3.1 million, plus inspections found that the administrations of the school and the property owner company were made up of the same people connected to Gülen.
Noting that similar situations were available at 46 branch Harmony schools holding the largest location on the Gülen network, Amsterdam stated that smaller companies connected to FETÖ were paid for with pens such as software license, curriculum purchase.
Amsterdam emphasized that it makes each other rich within the FETÖ, saying, "These examples show that about $28 million of American taxpayers have been misused."
"And that's the obvious part of what we've found so far," he said.
Amsterdam, which has thus far pointed out that nothing has been done to prevent such incidents, has reminded us that the situation has worsened during the past time period, with the Texas Department of Education beginning to investigate disorders.
Amsterdam stressed that schools operate normally in sight, many employees do not have any information on what kind of corruption there is.
Amsterdam said, "However, these schools actually work like snow machines for Smiler."
"Smile then uses massive amounts of money for political donations in order to conceal its illegal activities", he made his assessment.
According to a statement from a former American teacher who worked at these schools, some of the employees at Gülen schools held separate meetings, transferring a certain portion of their salaries to the organization, Amsterdam said, "It is believed that members of the Gülen in the Turkish Armed Forces are working in the same process."
Impact instigators were strengthening their positions over the years.
"However, while in sight the army was functioning normally, a parallel force was gathering power behind the scenes".
Amsterdam finished his article as follows:
The policy makers in the United States have questions about events between July 15th and July 16th and after, and that's expected.
However, as the two allies address their situation at diplomatic level, individuals in state authorities must wake up in Gulen's operations that U.S. laws have been serialized infringement.
22 members of the judiciary are on the run in Istanbul!
It has been learned from 648 judges and prosecutors who were suspended by the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) on 10 August 2016 and were investigated by Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office for allegedly being members of the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization.
648 judges and prosecutors who were suspended by HSYK on 11 August 2016 have been given detention and search warrants on 67 of them serving in İstanbul.
45 members of the judiciary who were searched by the prosecution in their homes and workplaces have been taken into custody.
The calls found that 22 judicial menses who had not been found in their address had escaped.
It has been learned that a warrant will be issued against these members of the judiciary.
Of the 45 suspects detained, 18 were reportedly referred to the Criminal Court of Peace after their testimony in the prosecution.
22 judges and prosecutors, whose addresses are missing, are still under way.
11 people have been detained in Konya!
As part of the investigation, work is being carried on to apprehend persons who have been given detention warrants.

Zechariah Öz statement from Çavuşoğlu
"This information is not true right now," Çavuşoğlu said to the question of allegations that Zechariah Öz and Fair Orphan were captured in Georgia.
But there are different reports coming in.
They're all being evaluated.
We're in close contact with the Georgian authorities.
"Every detail, information, tip is being scrupulously evaluated," he said.
"Zekeriya Öz had previously fled to Georgia," said Çavuşoğlu, asking if there was any doubt as to whether they might have been in Georgia.
It was on the security cameras at the customs gate.
He knows he's been to Europe.
Every information that comes to us is not just for these two, but for the other escapees, we're looking at it, we're tracking it.
We'll track them wherever they run."
"Double issues have been assessed," Çavuşoğlu said to the question regarding his meeting with Iranian counterpart Cevad Zarif.
Turkey has a lot of issues between Iran.
Our joint fight against political, commercial, transportation, energy, counterterrorism.
There are regional issues, too.
Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Gulf Region, primarily Syria.
Turkey and Iran can play an important role in solving problems in geography.
We agree on a lot of things.
We agree on many issues, including the territorial integrity of Syria, border integrity, and the removal of DAESH and other terrorist organisations in Syria, an inclusive government.
We had different ideas about Assad.
But we're gonna keep talking about this like we always do.
The truce, Geneva, we agree on the continuing negotiations.
Opinion on a lot of issues doesn't really mean anything unless it brings results.
"The important thing is to get results," he said.
"Our delegation had gone to Moscow on this issue," Çavuşoğlu said to the question as to when Turkish planes would participate in operations in Syria.
"The purpose of establishing these mechanisms is what steps are taken especially in the fight against DAESH here, and any incidents need to be coordinated so that the accident doesn't happen," he said.
"Iran and Turkey are two sister countries."
The arbitrations are not supposed to decide, so we can make a deal between ourselves.
I had a little bit of a system.
We should be able to make these deals before we go to my investigation.
"We've had demands on gas reduction, prices," he said.
Ask the question of the date of Gülen's return to America, Çavuşoğlu said, "On the 22nd, a delegation will arrive from America."
Meetings will take place on August 23–24.
Our Justice Department is preparing the case.
As soon as the file is ready, it'll be after visits from the United States.
"We will also go to Washington with our Minister of Justice and deliver the files and discuss them," he said.

It has once again proved that the Turkish people are superior to all forces to the will of the Turkish people and the people.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has condemned the coup attempt from the early hours of the coup attempt, having likewise been on the side of the Turkish people and government and has always been so.

But it's a brutal thing when he grabs the wounded and takes them to the hospital in the trunk of the car.
We're following this to the end.
One of these kids is dying.
The other one's in critical condition.
He's bringing the wounded from Narince to Kahta in the trunk of the car.
God damn it.
Don't let a wild thing like this happen again.
Our lungs are burning.
We're gonna press charges, and we're not gonna let this go.

Police have taken action after Selmet Şalu was reported to have been at Friday prayer at Salko Mosque on Sakarya Street, Adapazarı.
Teams on their way to the mosque waited for Friday prayer to be performed.
After the prayer ended, Selmet saw the police and raised his hands in the air.
He was taken to the police station with a warrant.
Gökhan Thanks went to the front of the police department, following his father's vehicle to the car he was taken to.
Sakarya Public Prosecutor's Office has determined that Hakan Thanksgiving and his father Selmet Şalu are providing financial support for FETÖ.
Examining the prosecution's application, the Court of Justice of Peace has decided that the moveables of Hakan Thanksgiving and his father Selmet Şahret, land transportation vehicles, accounts in banks or other financial institutions, all kinds of rights and rights in the eyes of real or corporate persons, valuable documents in their possession, share of partnerships in companies, value of safety deposit boxes, and other assets should be confiscated.

Watch out for children’s habits
Professor Dr. Scholar Giray of the Faculty of Dentistry said that children were relieved by this reflex by making sucking necessary because they could not perform the chewing process at the early age.
Comprising the causes of finger-sucking habit in children, Professor Dr. Giray said, "Toe-sucking is an event seen from birth to age 3-4."
Most babies suck their thumbs.
The boy who sucks his finger to satisfy the need for suction in his infancy absorbs his finger to satisfy his mother's breast longing and relief after he is 1–1.5 years old.
He said, "It's possible to get bored and stall himself, when he's sleepy, when he's nervous, and when he's separated from the mother, he can behave in a finger-sucking manner."
At the core of the finger-sucking behavior seen at an advanced age, Dr. Bilgin Giray stressed that insufficientness in the mother-child relationship and the lack of confidence in the child were not sufficiently developed, while Dr. Bilgin Giray described the effects of this behavior on dental health:
Finger-sucking behavior has a negative effect on the shape of the child's dental structure.
As a result of the pressures that arise during suction, the upper teeth are pushed forward, while the lower teeth are pushed back.
This leads to the lower jaw being positioned behind, destabilizing the palate and dental structure.
Physiological reflection of this is that speech disorder and closure look aesthetically bad.
"We can protect our children from closing and joint problems before jaw development is complete," said Professor Dr. Giray, noting that a much more complex treatment process can occur during the 6-7-year-old period when permanent teeth begin to grow.
"Therefore today, the oral structure, such as children's eye and hearing controls, needs to be kept under control," he concluded.
New breath in close vision treatment: Trifocal Lens
Patients after cataract treatment do not naturally want to use glasses.
For many years, multifocus lenses have already been used to address this problem in our patients.
It has taken one step further the success of treatment in this area with trifocal lenses that have recently been used.
The difference between trifocal lenses from other lenses is the ability to provide a clear view not only at remote or close range but also at distances described as intermediate distances.
Treatment for remote, close or intermediate vision disorders
The intermediate distance in vision disorders represents a point we often use in our everyday lives.
For example, the gauge panel of cars is the intermediate distances that we describe as portable computers that we hold in our laps, or 60 to 70 cm arm length.
With the trifocal lenses also correcting the intermediate distances, our patients don't need to use glasses in any way, close or far.
Another advantage provided by trifocal lenses is that it also reduces night complaints.
"Every distance is no different from the normal cataract treatment of trifocal lens treatment for vision treatment."
Our patients, who we're treating with trifocal therapy, will be in good health with a seven-to-ten-minute procedure.
And the next day, our patients can go back to their normal lives.
It is an operation that especially improves the quality of life for people who drive, use computers, like to read, and lead a more active life.
You can also apply to the ophthalmologist to see if this procedure applies to any patient who has reached the age of 18 is suitable for you.
The heirous vein is not used for heart surgery!
The heir is a disease whose frequency has grown considerably in recent years.
Genetic proximity is the primary factor; long working hours, work with a long standing obligation, and long sitting heir complaints.
Are veins used for heart surgery?
I have an heir, and questions like what happens if I have a heart attack in the future are often asked by people.
That's the answer to those questions.
There are two types of veins in the leg:
The 1st leg has a deep vein system called the main pathway that leads to the lungs and collects the actual dirty blood of the leg.
These are named deep femoral vein and superficial femoral vein.
Problems in these veins are rarer, the vein cannot be closed in their disease, and drug treatments are administered to keep these vessels open.
There's a superficial vein system in the leg that takes the dirty blood to the lungs and connects it with the deep vein system in the groin.
This system consists of two large and two small nagen vein veins called veins.
All four of these vessels may develop incapacity and the heir.
Arterials that can be used in heart surgery are superficial veins called the great puren vein.
The absence of these vessels does no harm to the body, and they can therefore be used in heart surgery.
But in order for these vessels to be used for heart surgery, the vessels must be healthy.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
The operation of the heirous vessels, or the burning of them by laser, also reduces the workload of the deep veins and ensures that the leg is healthier.
A false belief found among the public is that veins can be used as replacements, even if they are heirs.
The heirous vein is never, ever used in heart surgery!
There are other vessels that can be used in heart surgery.
Auxiliary vascular systems that can be used for heart surgery are located below the rib cage, around the stomach and in the arm.
Thus, it is unnecessary to keep the heired vein waiting to use for the heart and to worry about it.

Meaningful message from Uzbek before the Super Bowl
Galatasaray Sports Club President Dursun Uzbek issued a statement ahead of the Super Cup Final between Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.
Here are the words Dursun Uzbek pointed out to the unity and draw in Turkish football:
Galatasaray and Besiktaş, two-rooted and two favorite clubs of Turkish sport, will face each other Saturday (August 13th) for the Super Cup at Konya Metropolitan Torku Arena.
This is not the first, nor the last, in our two beautiful clubs' competition to put a century behind them.
But it's a vital encounter in timing.
As we all know, our country suffered a great deal on the night of July 15th.
The coup attempt of the Fetullahist Organization of Terror/Parallel State (FETÖ/PDY), which refers to our democracy, was overcome by the unity and unity of all sections of society.
That night as a nation, we paid heavy prices.
We've given martyrs.
We have a lot of gas.
This bitter price once again reminded us of the virtue of democracy, the necessity and importance of the rule of peace, not of strife in this land.
On that night, representatives of Turkish sport also opposed the coup d'état as one voice, one heart; they all sided with democracy.
In these critical times, we need the unifying feature of sport more than ever.
I wish that this match, which coincides with the 2nd anniversary of the passing anniversary of our worthy opponent, Süleyman Seba, and the beginning of the new football season named after our club's legendary captain, Turgay Sheren, would be the match of love and peace in Turkish sport.
At the end of the match in front of the stands, which Galatasaray and Beşiktaş fans will split in half, I wish the winner would be our country and Turkish sport, regardless of his score.

As Britain closes its gold, Scot Callum Skinner flies home
The Great Britain Team trio retained their title from 2012 London, while Scotland's Callum Skinner ran for victory last night in the men's race at the Rio race track.
Glasgow, a 23-year-old racer, took on the pioneering post adopted by Sir Chris Hoy of Scotland, and this young man made this legend proud as he returned home victorious with a New Zealand outfit that garnered appreciation.
At the event four years ago, when Hoy received five out of six Olympic gold coins, Britain had received a shocking victory.
And even though Hoy had retired, they reiterated this by finishing sixth in the March Race World Championships in London.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of expert starting player Jamie Staff.
They did it right when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement also created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
He had foreseen Scot's potential, which he had now accomplished, and the British trainers had not given up on Skinner.
Hindes, who won with Hoy four years ago, broke the Olympic record in the Kenny and Skinner ranking round, but New Zealand re-set that record in the first round.
And the British trio fought for gold.
Although Hindes was a little behind on his own tour, Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner endured it.
Using a larger tool to slow Hindes himself down, much of the transformation that allowed Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace was this change of strategy.
Hoy watched them from their place as the BBC's expert commentator and caught Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' eye when they went on the podium.
"It's an honorary comparison," said 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow.
I'm just here to do my best and make my name known.
We broke the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was really amazing.
There's no better way to win this.
Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a poor start in 2012 after a victory with Kenny and Hoy.
He then reacted to this interpretation, and there was no method of making demands from Britain's opponents.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
Hindes said: "It was as if we were in London with all the Great Britain flags on the stand."
We're just a team that was formed three months ago.
We've lost too many world races, so it's an incredible feeling to have won again at the Olympics.
This is only one event, one medal for a nation that won seven out of 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of progress we've made in the last five months, we've got five more days of success on the racetrack.
Kenny's attitude shows that Hoy's dream of repeating three gold records in a single Olympics is not impossible.
This would mean that Kenny, who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was himself born on March 23 (who was also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, a British sports past sacred history) reached six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's the same level as Hoy.
Kenny will take the sprint race from now on; the race will start today and last three days.
The 28-year-old Boltonian said: "For now I'm just enjoying it.
Team events are always the best.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, when you win alone, it makes you feel lonely.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be given the title of knight."
Although this is just the event of today's medal, there is a lot of good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished first in the four-man, four-kilometre team race.
They completed the track in 3:51.943.
The world record set by the gold medalist in London 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first round and final (22:42) will be determined in the second episode today, and it is certain that Wiggins will draw all attention to it.
Yesterday, prior to the ranking round, he had a disagreement with the officials when authorities called him to measure his height.
In the relevant women's event, which will continue tomorrow and be completed, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record for 4:13,260.
The Great Britain Team relies on the strong cycling team to take the reins during the middle period of the Olympic Games and win many medals.
Following the great superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were greatly reduced in Rio.
There have been many bad developments in the background, including manager Shane Sutton's resignation in April due to charges of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of notable figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the first night after the races on the track, it shows that Great Britain's epic reputation for finishing in perfect time will be proved again this time.
With the cancellation of the energy contract, the future of the Portland burner is doubtful.
The future of the Portland aluminum burner in Victoria and the work of hundreds of workers fell into obscurity following the dissolution of a supply contract by one of the facility owners, in a way that would have led to the cancellation of all supply contracts of the energy company providing the facility.
This move came after the Victorian government's decision earlier this year not to exceed subsidies to keep the facility running.
20 years of fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland facility.
Any shutdown can cause up to 2,000 jobs to go directly or indirectly at risk.
And since the stove consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's electricity, additional chain effects can occur.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry shut down the stove, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland isabe facility is losing money and is at risk of closing.
These developments initially emerged following speculation over several years for the future of the facility, based on the strengthening of the Australian dollar and on the recently-consuming fee of the facility.
The AGL provided power from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley to the large aluminum isabe furnace, expressing that it expects all three other owners to act to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the facility is owned by Alcoa and Alumina's joint venture, and China's CITIC, Japan's Marubeni Corp companies also own smaller shares.
"AGL expects Portland facility to continue working; which means the demand for physical electricity of the isabe stove will continue," he said.
The AGL stated that the contracts were "risk balancing contracts" that had to be enacted from November 2016.
Since the contracts are a 12-month termination period, they will be completed in 2017.
"Therefore, the AGL will continue to expect contracts to contribute to the fiscal year 2017," the energy company said.
The effects that the AGL may be subject to on the 2018 Financial Year and potential gain after, are present, limited to adopting a strong-term contract stance for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL expresses that the value of their contract in their account has already dropped to $187 million due to "feshin expected".
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate or provide electricity supply to the burner."
The US company signed a 20-year contract in 2010; this contract was supposed to take effect in November this year, but has yet to explain why it has not withdrawn from this contract.
Analysts are alert to the possibility that both the Portland isabe stove in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle will close due to economic difficulties in the sector.
Responding to analysts earlier this week, Stephen Mikkels, head of operations for the AGL, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts each year, and Tomago also uses 900 megawatts of energy each year.
In the event that both of these facilities are withdrawn from the market, the demand in the [electric] market will drop significantly.
And as a manufacturer, that would not be a good development for us."
Not just the star of the Kardashian TV show; Kendall is on the cover of Vogue's September issue
Kendall Jenner (20), fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner group of model and executive mother Kris, is on the cover of the U.S. Vogue's eagerly anticipated September issue.
Kendall, an Estee Lauder brand ambassador, appeared in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced this news from his Instagram account on Thursday.
Kendall wrote, "I cried when I looked at this door in a room full of people I loved."
Following the announcement of the cover, a scripted reality video was released, featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (which caused trouble in the bar) Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite showworld uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest), which was odd (or only unique to the Keeping Up with the Kardashians program), a scripted reality video; in the video, the family that forgot the cover of their sisters had then prepared a classic ending: they were actually preparing a surprise party.
Although this is the cliché storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of almost all children's television shows (Seacrest says with a cartoon rabbit sincerity at 8:00 a.m., "Did you think we'd forgotten about you?"), Kris should have included other girls in this introduction in some way.
With this development in Vogue's September issue, we are definitely entering a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have gotten past him about getting on the Vogue cover (the cover was sharing with his wife Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is a success in itself.
Vogue's September issue was the best-selling issue of the year.
With its thickness that resembled a coffee table book rather than a fashion magazine, this number attracted the attention of many advertisers (Fashionista found that there was advertising content in 615 of last year's 832-page volume).
The unveiling of the cover star is also a closely monitored process; over the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Women previously featured on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover features more celebrities who are modelling than "famous models".
Oscar-winning Dior envoy Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and the next year the honor was granted to Lady Gaga.
However, even if Miss Jenner, described by the magazine as the "shining model" of her generation, was taken into the previous category, her surroundings can be said to be quite good.
These celebrities are not the relatives of celebrities, or reality show stars, or the young people of today who know how to make good Snapchat videos (the real Jenner all).
These are all women whose talent is legitimate, prominent in the entertainment industry.
On the cover of last year, Beyoncé spent one of the best times of her career with Lemonade's debut.
Of course not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Due to its reality show history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be disturbing.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitches of the time."
When news surfaced that Jenner would appear on the cover of the Vogue, this thought surfaced again.
However, focusing on dissatisfaction seems uncalled for.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He's literally a supermodel.
She's doing Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
Estee Lauder's getting you a foundation.
He's selling his own pictures of you and his sisters in pay-walled apps.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, maybe he's only on reality TV to see his brother Kourtney and his kids.
Community legal support centers turn down 160,000 people every year
As the sector prepares for the impact of further funding cuts in already-forced operations, over 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable sectors are being rejected from community legal support centres.
Three of the five people in Queensland (mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, and those without resources to fight unfair eviction decisions, and others like them) are turned down in search of free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services, which have exhausted their means, are preparing for further interruptions.
Starting in June of next year, these legal support centres are scheduled to be deprived of more than 30 per cent of federal funding.
James Farrel, Queensland Director of the Centers for Social Legal Support, reported that thousands of people have been rejected each year in the final Countdown Report of the National Union of Community Legal Support Centers.
Mr. Farrel said the situation would worsen if the federal government decision was not reversed.
"Queensland's social legal support centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands are unable to achieve the vital services they need," he said.
People who are in violent relationships, who are struggling with power and backbreaking forces, families in the process of separation, and workers who are unfairly laid off -- all of them face problems with legal dimensions, and they are unable to get the help they need, according to this report.
The federal government will cut funding at 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of unguarded Queensland residents are forced to deal with more complex legal problems without assistance.
We urge the Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to withdraw these funding cuts immediately so that people can get the support they need when facing a legal problem.
Last year, the government fulfilled its promise to bring legal support funding to a national average.
We should now look at community legal support centers and the communities that they serve and the investment that the Palaszczuk government will make in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team was sued after staff allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team was sued for no action after the director of North Carolina operations was told that he had pulled a gun on a staff while walking around in a jeep in February.
The case was announced Wednesday by former software instructor Vincent Bordini of the state campaign team in a lawsuit filed in the state court.
Bordini expressed that he expected the situation to be dealt with from the inside for months, but later realized that "this is not going to happen".
As Bordini noted in his complaint, the Director, Earl Philip, "takes out a gun, puts his right index finger on the trigger, and holds the barrel towards Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, Bordini learned that at least four others had the same experience as Phillip after complaining to local and regional campaign team leaders.
Bordini said in his complaint, "The guns don't need to be fired to cause damage."
The case opened two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger to the crowd in North Carolina, saying that "The Second Amendment people" (apparently as gun owners and gun supporters) could take action if their opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and elected her own judges.
Trump's campaign team expressed that the media considered these remarks outside the context and that he himself did not support violence.
Bordini, with his complaint, is seeking compensation from the campaign team for oversight negligence and Phillip for assault, battery and spiritual harm.
Trump's spokesman Hope Hicks did not quickly return to the message asking him to comment.
His efforts to reach Phillip were inconclusive.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, was also not made a quick comeback.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial campaign.

"Report FETÖ" line
Following President Erdoğan’s call for "not everyone may know intelligence, not security, turn it in" for FETÖ people, MIT and Police have set up a tip line.
Following the July 15 coup attempt, new practices are also being initiated to identify "secret parishioners" who hide themselves while thousands of FETÖs are being expelled from institutions.
As part of the study, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emphasized the importance of the citizen's calls in the fight against the FETÖ, "You may have friends in that community, I say expose them."
You need to report it to the prosecution.
It's a patriotic debt.
He said, "Everyone may not know intelligence, they may not know security, or they may not be able to make it. Look, they're running away."
As part of the work, an online tip application was launched by the Ministry of Interior, Security Directorate and National Intelligence Agency (MİT).
According to this, he will be able to communicate to the security and MIT those who serve the FETÖ around the citizen, the organization he knows about, the organization's activities, the institutions that belong to the organisation.
Www.egm.gov.tr/pages/news, www.mit.gov.tr/your contact will keep the information of those who will report to the service via the links.
In the application of the tip submitted by the Police Department, those who want to include the document will be able to add it.
In the same application, he will be returned if the whistleblower wants him to.
The citizen will be able to make these notifications to the Public Prosecutors' Offices in the provinces and districts, as they can report to the 155 Police Assistance Line by telephone.
Inspired by the basement, they built an 'equivalent village' in Sivas
Canköy, sub-Governorship and philanthropist businessman in Gölova District of SIVAs were made 'for example village' in collaboration.
Their roads were paved and paved in the village with paved stone on their sidewalks, all houses were also painted blue and white by example of Muğla's Bodrum district.
The Gölova sub-Governorship has prepared a model village project to improve the image and quality of life of villages in the district.
As an example village in this scope, the 66-digit Canköy was elected 12 kilometres from the district centre.
Infrastructure and superstructure services increased, the village's roads were paved and its sidewalks paved with paved stone.
Village houses with different colors were painted with the support of businessman Selahattin Ayan, who owned Pelit Bakeries.
The whole village took on the image of buildings painted in white and blue colors.
BODRUM EXAMPLE ACCEPTED
Informing of the study, Lulova sub-Governor Erkan Jesus Erat stated that they were preparing this project to sign a work that would also form role models for other villages, stating: "It was part of our project that the village would look more modern, the houses would all be one color."
When we started this project, we looked for a place to sample.
When we got to the basement, we noticed a white-painted, blue-windowed view of the houses.
So we wanted to take the example of Basement because of white cleanliness and its positive effect on people.
By doing our work, we painted all the houses in Canville white and blue.
This work was done in government and charitable cooperation.
The project cost about $200,000.
With the study, our Canville in Sivas became like a small basement.
We want to continue this kind of work with our budget and the support of our businessmen again.
Abdullah Macit, 66, the Mayor of Canköy, said the village had a new image with the support of the sub-Governorship.
Macit thanked everyone who had worked hard, stating that being a model village also pleased them and the people of the village.
A drug operation at Kangal
Seven people have been detained in a drug operation organised by gendarmerie teams in Kangal district of SİVAS.

Four people's property was confiscated with Gülen in the FETÖ/PDY case in Adana
All assets of Fethullahist Terror Organization/Parallel State Construction (FETÖ/PDY) in ADANA were decided to be confiscated by Fethullah Gülen, Omar Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were tried in the 2nd Heavy Criminal Court for their alleged profit by zoning corruption.
A tip to Adana Police Department on May 15, 2015 claimed that in 2012, the Deputy Mayor of the Metropolitan did not mind and that the land owned by the Legal University, known for its proximity to the Gülen community by zoning corruption and plan fraud of its administration, was converted to the housing area, although it was not a parliamentary decision, giving the parish a total of £150 million rant.
As a result of the investigation launched on the report, the former President of the Trade Exchange of Ferat Yüksel, Mustafa Yüksek, Mustafa Yıkal, Hasan Yüksal and Adana has been arrested.
The 2nd Heavy Penal Court has been sued for five counts of prison sentences ranging from 5 to 35 years of imprisonment against 17 arrested defendants including Fethullah Gülen and former Adana Metropolitan Mayor Sub-Mayor Mind Ignored.
While not all defendants pleaded guilty to the charges, in the final hearing of the trial, all arrested defendants were released under judicial control and a foreign ban.
CONTINUES TO MALCOLM
The court has issued a warrant for the arrest of Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who are on the run along with Fethullah Gülen, the number one defendant in the case.
However, for the 4 fugitives who were not caught and did not come to the hearings, the court has decided that illegal proceedings should be carried out.
The court then decided that all assets of Fethullah Gülen, Omar Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu (CMK) whose assets were found in the foreign country to ensure that the case against them remained inconclusive and therefore fled because they could not reach him were seized under Article 278/1 of the Criminal Procedures Act.
With this decision, the fugitives' assets, land-sea and air transport vehicles, all kinds of rights and purchases, valuable documents, company shares, safety deposit boxes and bank accounts have been frozen.

The trust fund whose audit has been discussed is back on the commission.
Turkey's Entity Fund, which is expected to enter among the world's largest funds, has been removed from the law after objections.
Due to the lack of the funding's control mechanism, it was decided to re-interview, but was re-interviewed at the commission without any changes.
"We are absolutely against the fact that this structure, which will consist of the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, will be kept out of the mechanisms of Constitutional supervision," said CHP MP and Plan and Budget Commission Member Utku Çakırözer, who evaluated the Turkish Wealth Fund law proposal brought by the AKP to Sozcu.com.tr.
The government's proposal for the Turkish Wealth Fund to provide long-term funding for investments and projects was passed on Tuesday, with the opposition also saying that the bag should be discussed.
However, the AKP brought the proposal back to the Plan and Budget Commission today, as it were.
Eskişehir MP Utku Çakırözer, a member of the TMMM Plan and Budget Commission, told sozcu.com.tr of CHP's concerns and concerns about the Entity Fund law proposal.
"When the establishment of this fund came to the Plan and Budget Commission within the bag bill, our former Finance Minister, Zekeriya Kekel, who was head of the CHP delegation, expressed our concerns and concerns, proposing that this be removed from the bag law and also discussed in detail."
And the government, which agreed to our opinion, withdrew the bill.
The bill came back to the commission yesterday as it was.
"The government seems to insist that this be removed from Parliament within a week," he said.
"Our greatest concern in this proposal of law is non-rule," Cakirözer said, stating that there should be a consensus on the coming out of the Act of Being Fund law.
"The entities belonging to the public, the laborer's mandatory retirement cuts from employees, incomes that will consist of the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, revenues from privatisation, outside of Parliament and Court control, and are being handed over without rules to a structure with no responsibilities," he said.
"However, we have a savings deficit," said Çakırözer, who said that such funds were established in Russia, China and Gulf countries have oil revenues and more than trade, and that the fund was funded in this way."
So the fund is going to be made up of public resources, public money.
A total of 100 billion in unemployment funds, 100 billion in individual pension funds forced into employees, 50 billion in privatisation are planned.
"So this fund, which will be made entirely with the money of the public, must be under public supervision, and that money should not be spent irresponsibly," he said.
Cakirözer, emphasizing that it is unacceptable to keep a state-owned fund out of Parliamentary control, where the government's resources are collected, in its debt is shown as collateral, described his concerns and concerns about the Entity Fund law proposal as follows:
Business and transactions on the collection, spending, borrowing such a large public presence on behalf of the public cannot be passed only by the supervision of independent audit companies.
There must be public control and a transparent structure.
In the law proposal, there are no provisions on the control and transparency of the Entity Fund by Constitutional institutions.
There's no limit to how much funding will be transferred.
No one will be able to account for how this fund is used.
Fund's goal is to finance major projects.
There's no need to set up an unsupervised fund outside the budget.
Why don't you put it in the budget?
And when that happens, it comes naturally to the question, "Why is Countstone and Parliamentary oversight being avoided?'"
Noting that they are not opposed to the transfer of money accumulated in the Wealth Fund, but that they are opposed to this being done by non-transparent, non-accountable mechanisms, Çakırözer said. "Is such funding necessary?"
But if the government insists on it, then we have to make sure that valid international standards apply in Turkey in other countries where such investment funds are established.
It must be structured in some way that the mechanism of control and responsibility is brought in.
It has to be established in a way where there will be no doubts, that will account for its own money used to the citizen to the last penny.
"We are pleased that the AKP is listening to our criticism in the House, especially after the July 15 coup attempt," Chakırözer pointed out that they are absolutely opposed to the law proposal as it comes to the commission.
We hope that the AKP will listen to our constructive criticism in this law proposal.
We are opposed to the use of national beings without rules, to the transfer, to the irresponsible of those who use it, and to the non-public audit.
"The desired Wealth Fund can only be useful if these concerns are addressed," he said.
It has been learned that efforts have been made to reach a compromise between the AKP and the opposition.
"Our confidence in Turkey is our investment"
"Our $30 billion investment in the past 5 years is a sign of confidence in our country's future," Ford Automotive Board Chairman Ali Koc said at a meeting in Istanbul.
Coach Holding Board Acting Chairman and Ford Automotive Board Chairman Ali Koc and director of several foreign capital firms met at a meeting on "those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey" organised by the Istanbul Industrial Chamber (ISO).
"With our partners, our faith and confidence in our country is not merely a supposed statement, but we are filling it with our investments and our action."
The $30 billion investment we've made in the last 5 years is a sign of confidence in our country's future.
Its essential issues for Turkey to attract more foreign investment are a reliable and just legal system, a democracy of international standards, a qualified workforce, and an ecosystem that promotes the value of Ar-Ge, innovation, entrepreneurship and addition.
In the last few years, our government has presented our industrialists with the most comprehensive incentives in our history of the Republic.
"I believe that with these incentives and holistic strategies, we will be able to start a new "Instrumentation Move" that we need."
"Now we know this as global players, not just a single country's problem," said Hussain Gelis, chairman and CEO of Siemens Industry and Trade Turkey's Board.
We came to Turkey with a long-term look.
If we are united and united, our problems will be solved.
We were able to bring what couldn't have been in Turkey 160 years ago to this land.
We will continue to be in these areas in Turkey.
"Of course we'll build factories, but our horizons should be clear in this area," he said.
"Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for Shell Turkey Country President Ahmet Erdem," Shell said. "Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for Shell."
We sincerely believe in Turkey's potential and future.
We've invested in a lot of areas, especially energy, and we're still doing it.
We thank our President, Prime Minister and Ministers for their support of international investors.
There are work that gives confidence for international investors.
"This is in the direction of boosting our country's competitiveness," he said.
"Our Global CEO would arrive in Turkey on August 10," said Dr. Altan Demirdere, President of Sandoz/Novartis Turkey and the Middle East Region.
However, the trip was delayed.
That's what we objected to.
Because the CEO's arrival was very important.
They made requests for bulletproof cars, protection.
And then when he got here, he saw that everything was normal.
He left the guards and the car and returned to his country happy.
Investment in a country is like marriage.
First there's a promise, and if everything goes well, you get engaged and you get married with a long-term plan.
We're married to Turkey, and we have no intention of getting a divorce.
It's back from the edge of the cliff!
Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım called his businessmen by teleconference at the consultation meeting on "those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey" organised by the Istanbul Industrial Chamber at the Swiss Hotel.
"We should also not miss the process of transitioning to 'Industrial 4.0' in the industry," Prime Minister Yıldırım said, adding that the industry is the industrial sector that will provide Turkey's comparative superiority.
He said, "If we are a high-valued, country's locomotive and care about capturing 2023 targets, we need to think about the industrial revolution, along with the IT and technology revolution, and we need to achieve it."
"Those who mean our country's future, those who try to destroy its democracy, those who don't even hesitate to bomb our Veteran's Assembly, if they were successful, we were talking about another Turkey today," Prime Minister Yıldırım added on the night of July 15th.
We were going to talk about a Turkey between the third world countries, which had been taken over, the national will eliminated, and the world dropped out of the developing league.
“Thank God, our nation’s chieftain, our Commander-in-Chief, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s resilience and our government’s determination have removed this scourge”.
"We will quickly get out of the impact of this incident and move forward," Prime Minister Yıldırım said.
It's never, ever right that we live with the constant blow.
We've got a lot of ambitious targets ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not shake Turkey's economy.
Those who expected chaos and crisis were once again mistaken.
Today, both our democracy and our economy are alive and well.
Our banking sector, our financial sector, continues to function in good health.
In 2015, the foreign trade deficit seems to have dropped by 25 percent.
The rate of the current deficit to national income was 5.8% in 2014, which has declined to 4.5 per cent in 2015.
We aim to reduce it to four at the end of the year.
We will never change our firm standing in public finance.
Turkey's 2016 budget also exceeded the national income of 130 countries.
We've reduced the national income rate of the budget deficit of over 11 percent to 1.3 percent in 2015, and we're trying to maintain those rates.
In public debt, we are better off than the EU, than most countries in the world.
Our banking financial sector continues to work on solid ground.
"Our Central Bank did not feel the need to exchange currency to the market despite July 15 and there is no reduction in our reserves, we have over $121 billion in gross reserves".
"We are also making extensive arrangements for you to recover from your burdens towards the past," Prime Minister Yıldırım said, adding that they will provide all the conveniences for the development of the economy, increased production and the formation of new jobs.
We've carried out a lot of arrangements, and we're going on and on until we've reached a re-indulgence and re-indulgence of the cash register and unpaid tax debt.
"Keep producing for the country, keep relying on your country, and your government will continue to lift the obstacles in front of you one by one," he said.
Hakan Thanksgiving's father was hospitalized for high sugar.
The father of Hakan Güna who was detained as part of the operation against the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization in Sakarya has been taken to hospital as a result of his sugar rising during questioning.
Following the July 15 coup attempt by Sakarya Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, the operation launched against the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization had taken place last night.
Today, the father of Hakan Şalu who was taken into custody in Adapazarı was taken to hospital while his interrogation was ongoing.
The treatment for Semmet Thanky, who has been hospitalized as a result of his sugar rise, continues at Sakarya Training and Research Hospital.
Turkey does not part with the West, does not give up on European Union
Mehmet Simsek: Turkey does not part from the West, does not give up on European Union
Deputy Chief Minister Mehmet Simsek, Minister of Science Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü attended a meeting organised by Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci İstanbul Industrial Chamber (ISO) on "those who trust Turkey, those who produce it in Turkey".
"I think there have been many good results from the developments on the night of July 15th and after," said Science Industry and Technology Minister Faruk Özlü at the meeting.
The most important of all is, no doubt, the spirit of unity and unity that all of Turkey now feels deeply.
The July 15th process showed how robust the Turkish economy is, and how intrinsic society is.
"For a society that has captured this level in economics and democracy, it is clear that the next process will move better and faster".
"TURKEY NEEDS TO GET OUT OF THIS SURVICE"
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said they were having trouble telling the world about the July 15 coup attempt from Faruk Özlü, saying they are declaring mobilisation as a government.
"If 63.4% of the first five faces of my real sector are going to interest, we have to give up all our work."
That's why our President is coming back and saying it.
With the Reel sector, with the banking system, with its government, with its politics, after the July 15th civil Turkish democracy revolution, Turkey needs to be free of its misery in unity and togetherness.
We welcome recent developments in this regard.
He said, "I hope we will be able to sustain its sustainability, its continuity by supporting this competition as economic management, which began in the coming period with the encouragement of our President, starting at zero per cent per cent per month, as low as the eights."
"REGULAR PASAPORT, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE OUR REGULAR AN EMERGENCY"
"In the next period, win the world, we will be scooped up," Nihat Zeybekci said, "We will not leave a country that has not been visited in the world under the leadership of our president, our Prime Minister, nor leave a door without a knock."
We're not leaving anyone we haven't contacted about increasing our trade.
"We will never, ever ignore that; we will not be of the birds at hand as we run after the bird on the branch," he said.
Zeybekci also said later that exporters would be given green passports, saying "One of the most recent decisions is that his law has been passed, and we have now completed its regulation in the economy ministry; we will order the privileged green passport, our exporter, representing this country, from our exporters, approximately 17 to 20,000, as of the initial figures."
"APPLAUSE CONTINUES IN DARBEE ENTER"
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek referred to the coup attempt on July 15 and the OHAL declared after, said Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek calling it a 'bus' for the coup attempt. "But it is behind us, we need to move forward now".
"Of course, those involved in this coup attempt need to be cleared of the state, and this process is working; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms were needed to avoid further attempts at such a coup," said Simsek, who said for two simple reasons.
And as a necessary climate for these administrative reforms, the State of Emergency has been declared and so far very serious structural reforms have been made.
"Of course we acted within democratic principles and the state of law while we were doing all this," he said.
Expressing that life has returned to normal in many areas, Lightning stressed that there is no cause for concern for companies and individuals who are not involved in the financing of terrorism.
"I think the foundations of Turkey's democracy have been solidified; because when you look at the origin of the problems in the recent past, you will see that this network of betrayal is involved.
"So the removal of this terrorist organization from the state will strengthen Turkey's democracy because this period is closing in Turkey," he said.
"Turkey has returned to its original agenda, there is progress in structural reforms," Simsek said, saying that the economy is generally sound and that they have returned to normal structural reform agendas without any time.
Structural reforms are already essential because populism, conservationism, is increasing in the world.
"Turkey can only prepare for the future by reforming it," he said.
Finally, he stressed that Turkey will not break up from the West, saying "Turkey may occasionally be at odds with our Western allies, our friends; but Turkey does not break up from the West, it does not give up the European Union".
He jumped 25 meters into the sea and...
In Antalya, 17-year-old Shamil Tayyar Flagçi was hospitalised when he jumped overboard from cliffs 25 metres high called 'Etal Hill'.
Shamil Tayyar Flagçı, who swam with his friends in the evening hours on the subcontinent beach, then jumped overboard from cliffs 25 metres high known as "The Eagle Hill" under the variant.
The professional swimmer, Shamil Tayyar Flagman, was injured by the impact of impact on the water.
Having difficulty moving in the sea, Flagçı was taken ashore by his friends, who, like himself, were also professional swimmers.
Paramedics who came to the scene after the report took Shamil Tayyar Flagçı to Antalya Training and Research Hospital by ambulance following the intervention.
It has been noted that the treated Flagçer is in no danger of life.
A friend of Flagçi who testified to the police said, "His neck was hurt when he jumped off Eagle Hill."
He said, "We didn't see that coming."
25 dead - Speaker Newspaper
Settlements in Sarmada Town, Idlib Province, Syria, located about 10 kilometres from the Cilveöz Border Gate in Reyhanlı County, Hatay, were shot down by regime aircraft.
Local sources have reported that 25 people were killed in the attack and 40 others were injured.
Two separate air strikes were launched by regime aircraft at noon and evenings to Sarmada Town, which was controlled by dissidents near Syria's Bab-Al Air Border Gate across the border gate.
Local Resources stated that aircraft were targeting settlements in the airstrike and 25 people were killed.
The attack, also heard from Reyhanlı, has reportedly injured 40 people, while the death toll is feared to increase.
President Erdoğan has elected Kaya as member of the YÖK!
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has elected Undersecretary of Finance H. Abdullah Kaya as a member of the Higher Education Board (YÖK).
"Our President has elected Undersecretary of Finance H. Abdullah Kaya under Article B/1 of the 6th of the Higher Education Act 2547 which was vacated due to the resignation of Syed Ahmet Bash".
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, meanwhile, approved the "International Workforce Law" No. 6735.
The Presidential Press Centre said, “The International Workforce Act No. 6735 has been sent by our President to the Prime Minister to be published under the first joke of Article 89 of the Constitution and the second joke of Article 104 (a).
Two brothers died in Kahta shooting.
In Kahta County, ADIYAMAN, two brothers were killed by an armed attack in the car.
The incident occurred on Mustafa Kemal Street in the evening hours.
A gun was fired on the 02 KH 839-plated car under the direction of 39-year-old Ramazan Karahan, heading towards the district headquarters.
The car, under Karahan, which lost control with the opened fire, crashed into another vehicle.
Meanwhile, coming to the side of the car, Ramazan shot Karahan and his older brother Omar Karahan, 50, one after another.
The Karahan brothers were badly injured, while the attacker fled the scene on a motorcycle.
Police and paramedics were dispatched to the scene following the report.
The severely injured Karahan brothers were taken to Kahta State Hospital by ambulance.
Omar and Ramazan Karahan, who were treated in the emergency room, were not rescued despite all efforts by doctors.
While the bodies of the two brothers were being put in the morgue for the autopsy, police investigating the CCTV and security cameras in the area where the incident occurred launched a study into the identity of the escaped attacker.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only offer renewal and prosperity in our local communities and in London, but also across the country.
I think this is going to make Heathrow quite attractive, as in London 2012, when we've been trying incredibly hard to make sure that all nations and territories benefit from the Games.
The Olympics provided major advantages for Stratford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for locals and firms close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs, and we will not leave unemployed young people around the airport.
As before London 2012, there will be those who think the struggle to expand Heathrow is too challenging.
I was told that Britain would never prepare for the Games and that we would be disgraced all over the world.
Those who doubted were wrong in 2012 and will also be seen to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers all the questions asked.
As with the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
Expansion leaves the opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs and £211 billion in economic growth, and many skills and jobs both around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have a great team at Heathrow (which was named the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row) up to T2, implementing an infrastructure investment worth £11 billion in time and budget for the two busiest runways in the world.
We are now ready to offer a third runway supported by a private investment worth £16 billion.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the United Kingdom, and I have no doubt that the Heathrow expansion will be the same.
It is time for us to channel this Olympic spirit into the expansion of Heathrow to secure our commercial future and create many skills and jobs that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Secretary of the Treasury Department of Commerce.
Adblock Plus, Facebook "like a cat-rat game" on advertising blocking
According to one of the companies that makes attempts to block advertising blocking software for companies making money from online ads, it resembles the "cat-rat game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block advertising blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus released a blog post saying its users could update their filters to block ads on social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the codes around the ads to make it harder for advertisers to determine which part of the page is advertising.
However, Adblock now says he's deciphering new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokeswoman Ben Williams wrote that "a forward-back struggle between the community of blocking open source ads and those trying to prevent them has been going on since advertising was invented," and it is possible that Facebook has recently produced its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company is in this fight shows how much concern advertising blockers have raised for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, about 200 million people globally use advertising blockers, which is four times the number of people using this type of software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion days of active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
According to a spokesperson, mobile advertising blockers are not effective on Facebook's mobile applications and Instagram for social networking, so the company is on the hunt for advertising blockers on its desktop.
Since Facebook considers such a move worthy of investment, desktop ads should still be able to provide sufficient revenue.
Again on Tuesday, Facebook announced it would update its "public preferences" vehicle so people could better control the ads presented to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were alarming and would also block some of the non-advertising content on the site.
"These people are not offering a good experience and we plan to deal with this problem," said a Facebook spokesperson in an email statement.
Advertisers are a blunt instrument, so we're focused on creating tools like Advertising Preferences to give people control.
A woman ran into the Swiss highway; it looks like suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
In what appears to be suicide, police are looking for people who witnessed several vehicles hit her on the highway earlier Thursday.
The incident occurred just after midnight Thursday at A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud.
Vaud police said in a statement that the woman had "desperately fallen on the floor" in the dark and had been hit by several vehicles.
The 49-year-old Swedish woman, who was clearly willing to kill herself, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Police testified that several of the drivers involved had been interviewed, but some were not identified, and asked them and everyone involved to appeal to them.
Attorney Gilles Hofstetter explained to Le Tribune de Geneve that "a criminal prosecution has been opened as a "reasonable" step to be made in situations like this."
However, it is not yet known if drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
That's what the prosecutor needs to find out," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the past five years indicate that drivers will not be held accountable.
The paper ruled that it was normal in both cases (both involving a person who was on the highway in the dark), not to expect drivers to expect a pedestrian crossing the highway at midnight.
Last year, in August 2014, one night at A1, a police officer who hit a man lying on the road near Payne was found not guilty of causing death due to negligence.
The court said the 22-year-old victim was drunk and passed out on the way.
The court testified that the police officer, who was responding to an emergency call, was using the vehicle reasonably and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Anyone who knows about this incident near Morges on Thursday should call the police from phones 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once suitable for living
According to estimates of the new NASA climate model, Venus once had conditions suitable for life.
Scientists at the NASA Institute of Goddard Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus was once home to conditions similar to those on Earth, with its hot, waterless surface and its atmosphere filled with CO2.
Scientists in the past explained Venus' low rotation with a thick layer of atmosphere.
However, the newest estimates suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and yet may turn slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of the old Venus.
Although its planet has more dry zones than Earth, it may once have had sufficient water and protection against rapid evaporation with geographic variability.
The ancient Venus was also taking advantage of a dimer sun at 30 percent.
GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a newsletter, "In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus' slow rotation was making sure that the daytime side was facing the sun for almost two months at a time."
This heats up the surface, causing rains that make up thick layers of cloud that move like an umbrella that protects the surface from solar warming.
As a result, just a few degrees colder than Earth is today, the average climate temperatures were emerging.
The model allowed Venus to create a story similar to the evolution previously proposed by planetary scientists as a hypothesis.
Although it once had conditions suitable for life, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.
Their ocean evaporated and the water vapor was burned to the ground by ultraviolet rays.
Hydrogen is depleted, and all that's left is a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas effect — Venus as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Studies Articles.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche antecedent
Patrick Roy resigned as vice president of Colorado Avalanche coaching and hockey operations on Thursday, expressing that the team was not given a say in the decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, vice president/general of Colorado, approved this development and stated that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations at the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said Roy, 50, in his statement.
I've been thinking long and hard about how I can make this team better and better by giving them the depth they need all summer.
To achieve this, the vision of coach and VP hockey operations must be in perfect harmony with the vision of the foundation.
He also needs to have a say in decisions affecting the team's performance.
In the present situation, these conditions have not yet been met.
Sakic, who joined Roy to the team on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Sakic said, "Patrick informed me of his decision today."
We thank him for everything he's done for our foundation, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league during his first season with Avalanche in 2013–14.
The club earned 112 points and allowed the team to finish first in the league, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the first round of the play-off period and missed postseason games in both years.
Avalanche surpassed its 39-39-4 target in 2015–16 and scored five points less than needed for the second wild card area at the Western Conference.
Roy, the goalkeeper on the Hall of Honor, won four Stanley Cups, two for the Montreal Canadiens, both for the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue talks by suspending strike
The strike of North Sea oil workers was suspended due to the fee, and chief negotiators began discussions for a new round of talks.
The strike against the oil field services company Wood Group is run gradually on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"As Unite and RMT unions with the Wood Group, we have decided to restart the process to resolve the current dispute," a joint statement said.
In the next few weeks, from the beginning of next week, we will hold a series of meetings that will last all day to adopt a new perspective on problems.
Labor unions have expressed that this protest against wage cuts that could reach 30 per cent has been their first since 25 years.
This year, Wood Group cut approximately 9% of payments to its contractors in the North Sea due to negative pressures in the market.
Following this fee reduction process, the company's carriers on the coast also received a price reduction of 10 per cent in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would provide the company with the space needed to pass through the difficult period in the market.
Shell laid off thousands while putting their operations in order with the British energy company BG Group, and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in the country up to 10.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low crude oil prices, an economic situation generated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson will meet with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labor conflicts in the North Sea.
As he himself said, the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
"We need an effective economy for the majority, not the North Sea and across the country for the minority," he said in a statement.
Despite an average investment of approximately $7 billion over the past five years, in 2016, new projects in the North Sea are expected to be invested less than $1.4 billion.
Kepler measured the rotational speed of the stars in the Pleiades constellation
The Kepler space telescope, with its final mission, helped astronomers to form the most complete catalogue in terms of the rotational speeds of stars in the constellation Countryr.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the constellation rotate at variable speed and their rotational period is related to planetary formation.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a newsletter, "When we compare our results with clusters of stars, we hope to be able to learn more about the relationship between the mass, age and even the history of a star's solar system."
The nation's constellation is 445 light years from Earth.
Most of the stars in the constellation were formed 125 million years ago and are reaching the new level of adulthood.
They spin as fast as they can in their lifetime.
At top-turn speeds, these maturing stars form a large amount of star wind.
These winds have a breaking effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As a star gets older, its rotation rate begins to drop.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by watching the time between the appearance of noticeable starspots, such as sunspots.
The latest rotational speeds catalogue suggests that larger stars rotate faster than small stars.
Rebull has expressed that by comparing the stars to dancers, the great ones perform their turns on one foot more slowly than the small ones.
Rebull said, "We see that those who spin slowly in the country's 'balloon' are much heavier and those who spin fast are very light stars."
Since the nation's constellation is so close, it acts as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing star characteristics to rotational speeds.
Rebull said, "As young and old of the country's constellation, it provides theoretical models for star returns in both directions".
There's a lot more we want to know about how, when, and why stars go down, and why, so to speak, they leave their dancing shoes in one corner.
Rebull and colleagues have detailed their newest analysis of the Avler team star's return speeds in three new articles to be published in the Journal of Astronomy shortly.
