You threw a snowball in my eye.
You have abused my trust.
You're a great assistant.
You've been drinking, haven't you?
You're luckier than me.
You were so understanding.
You got something for Mary.
I think you've had enough water.
You've put on weight.
You already gave Tom three copies of the report.
You've got everything.
You have nothing to complain about.
You have to control your emotions.
You have to see him.
You've had a busy morning, haven't you?
You've never been to the United States.
You passed the test.
You've probably heard of us.
You want a good horse.
You wanted an economy car, didn't you?
You want to donate money, don't you?
You're heavier than Tom, aren't you?
You were flirting with us.
You were getting undressed.
"You did great, Tom." "This is nothing you've ever seen."
You were in on it all along.
You weren't very pretty.
You were opening the door.
You were right to leave.
You were so strong.
You're supposed to be ready.
You were awesome.
You're the one who suggested I visit Tom.
You were unconscious.
That's the only place you'll get it.
You're gonna get hungry.
You're gonna have to join the project.
We'll have to settle for what we have.
You'll regret your decision.
Now you won't be able to do anything about him.
You won't be able to help us.
As long as Tom's alive, there's no breath for you.
There's no peace for you while Tom's alive.
You won't die of old age.
You're not gonna fool Tom.
You're not gonna get away with this.
You're not gonna give it to Tom, are you?
You won't have to do this today.
You won't regret hiring Tom.
You can't solve anything by crying.
You work in Milan.
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be in trouble.
You wouldn't want that to happen, would you?
You write very well, don't you?
You should know for yourself.
Let's get out of here.
Yumi will be a teacher.
Yuri usually went to London in those days.
Zeke Choi's spine was shattered by an assassin's bullet.
Zero degrees centigrade, high fever, poor Mr. Snowman.
Zeynep, my roommate.
Zimbabwe was once British colonial.
The pumpkin is a summer vegetable.
