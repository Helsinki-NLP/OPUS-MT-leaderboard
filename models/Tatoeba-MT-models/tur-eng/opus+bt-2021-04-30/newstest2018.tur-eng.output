Breaking news: Our Cosmic Visitor Giant Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions of giant asteroids loose in the solar system that can cause serious consequences when they hit.
These objects that can have closed or open orbits from the formation of the Sun sometimes pass through the Earth.
The 650-metre-wide asteroid 2014 JO25 is a visitor like this, and will pass by 1.75 million km from Earth at 2:24 p.m. today.
We've been hearing this kind of news more and more often.
The most important reason is observation techniques and improvements in observation devices.
This allows us to identify smaller-sized asteroids that have not been identified before.
Last January, for example, an asteroid the size of a bus passed only half the distance of Earth and the Moon (~250,000 km).
And even more interesting, the asteroid was only determined a few days before the transition.
So there could be other cosmic buses coming at us right now.
Imagine what you would do if you heard that an asteroid within a 20-metre radius would fall right in the middle of your neighborhood.
Well, asteroids of this size won't destroy your neighborhood, but they'll probably blow up windows all over the building.
This will be due to shock waves from the asteroid that will explode in the atmosphere.
For example, in 2013, the asteroid that fell into Russia was of these sizes and was enough to smash through the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you have a neighborhood within 100 meters of an asteroid, your advice is to get at least 30 miles from your neighborhood.
Critics such as the size of the asteroid and the angle of impact are factors that determine the depth of the crater and the damage caused by impact.
Let's take a look at a few scenarios based on the simulation of the European Space Agency.
If a 100 m diameter asteroid hits Earth at a 45-degree angle of 60 km per second, it forms a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and an anchor of 1,200 meters.
The impact is equivalent to an earthquake at 6 on the Richter scale, and even if you're 10 kilometers from the impact point, you get third-degree burns.
And those 50 kilometers away will be waiting for shattered window windows.
If an asteroid hits a mile in diameter, it becomes even more depressing.
With the same angle and speed value, if such an asteroid hits Earth, it forms a crater at a depth of about 600 meters and 12 km in diameter.
So a whole neighborhood turns into a crater and disappears instantly.
Even if you're 100 kilometers away from the impact point due to the heat caused by the impact, you get third-degree burns.
The impact is equivalent to an earthquake at 8 on the Richter scale.
The damage to the asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also on the rock structure of the region it will hit.
The above values are given based on the scenario that arises if a hard rock-like asteroid falls into an area of sedimentary rocks.
If the asteroid is mostly made up of iron, if it falls on a surface formed by the cooling of lava, the crater size will increase by threefold, and the disaster that arises accordingly will fold.
66 million years ago, something worse happened to the dinosaurs and they were hit by an asteroid about 10 km across.
75 percent of the marine and land creatures were instantly destroyed by asteroid impact.
If such a large asteroid that destroys dinosaurs has targeted Earth, I assure you the most robust option is to leave the planet.
There's tons of matter falling out of space every day.
Most of them burn down in the atmosphere.
Some asteroids, large enough, burn in the atmosphere, causing flashes known as star-shifting amongst the public.
Let's end our article with another piece of comforting news.
Studies show that over the next 300 to 400 years, a giant asteroid is not expected to hit Earth, causing very serious destruction.
As an average of 70 years of living beings, I'm sure you're quite relieved.
Flash claim for Medel: 10 million euros!
The name on the agenda of the Black-Whites who want to reinforce the Stoper area is Gary Medel, who is considered certain to be leaving Inter...
After playing for the Confederation Cup in Chile, a 30-year-old footballer who took a vacation and recently resumed work with Inter expects offers.
Gazzetta dello Sport, one of the Italians' prestigious newspapers, suggested that Beşiktaş made an offer of 10m euros to Inter for Medel, who could serve in both the stoper, and the front libero area.
The Black-Whites, who offered Medel his offer, were told to expect answers from both sides, while the Chilean footballer was keen to live with his family in Istanbul.
Despite Gazzetta's claim, it is difficult for Black Eagle, the FFP limit, to pay a price of 10m euros for the Medel.
There is the possibility that black-and-whites will first turn to the Medel through lease, as with the Caner Erkin transfer, or add the star player to the cast if a serious discount is taken on his bonus.
Beşiktaş reported the Negredo transfer to the stock market
Human rights group issued travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Progress of Colored People issued a warning for people of color to travel to Missouri, due to the province's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "Missouri state NAACP Travel Recommendation Notice, valid from August 28, 2017, advises African-American travellers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention and be extremely cautious as they travel from beginning to end of the state as stated there, due to the recent suspicious, racial-based events are occurring across the state."
NAACP said that a new Missouri law made it difficult for people to win discrimination cases, as well as the disproportionate targeting minorities of the state's law practices, was instrumental in publishing this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin," said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP to Kansan City Star.
"We hear complaints at a rate we've never heard before."
It is the first time the association has issued such a warning for a state in the United States.
The group cited racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the deaths of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
At the beginning of this year, Sanders was detained and died under suspicious circumstances after running out of fuel as he passed through the state without being charged with a crime by Missouri police.
The recommendation also points out a new report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state are more likely to be stopped by 75 percent than white people.
"The notice of the press is for people to be alert and warn their families, friends and colleagues that they may be in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be ready to bring bail money with them, "to inform their relatives that they're going through this state."
In Missouri, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, according to the latest figures in the FBI's hate crimes reporting program; this places the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law in which it is more difficult to sue a workplace for discrimination when renting or employing a job.
Previously for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Texas and Arizona had issued travel advice after the local executive authorities of these states passed immigration repeal laws ordering people to arrest for immigration violations; the ACLU says it would increase practices by race.
Travel warnings are often issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently defense groups have applied for this practice in response to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba out in Beşiktaş
Demba Ba, who was transferred to Chinese team Shanghai Shenhua for 13m euros two seasons ago and was loaned to the Black-Whites during the half-time of last season, returns to Beşiktaş for free.
Asking the Senegalese player for a detailed health report last week, Black Eagle took action following a report from the star footballer.
Black-White management, which began work for the 32-year-old player the Chinese representative did not think of on the roster next season, knocked on the Shanghai team's door.
Not listed
Demba Ba, who was not listed because of his foreign status in China, conveyed to the administration that he wanted to return to the Black-Whites.
The Chinese team approved the departure of the 32-year-old player.
Senegalese footballer is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days and sign an official contract.
Castillo was operated on at Trabzonspor
In a statement on the Bordo-blue club's website, Castillo reportedly underwent an arthroscopic meniscus operation from his left knee at Istanbul Liv Hospital, stating that "Our post-op player carried out by Prof. Dr. Uður Rights is predicted to begin training with the team in four weeks".
Castillo had been injured by his right rear muscle in the Bordo-blue team's preparation match with Dutch team Heerenveen at the Slovak camp.
The Colombian player, who was announced to stay away from the field for 3–4 weeks due to his treatment, was also slated to be operated on due to his earlier problem of meniscus.
A referendum exit from Barzan!
Barzani delivered a speech at a memorial service in Duhok city due to the 3rd anniversary of DEAŞ's attack on the Ezidi in Sincar district of Musul.
Referring to the independence referendum that the IKBY wants to hold on September 25th, Barzani said: "I have to say this with regret, we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and decent country."
Iraq and I have tried all our ways, but we are completely helpless and desperate.
Our past experiences with Iraq have put us in this position, and there's no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect ourselves.
That's why we all need to show the world that we can decide our fate through a referendum to ensure life and security together.
I have to underline this; the referendum is not a goal for us, but a means for us to achieve the greater goal.
Barzani, who recalled that the Iraqi central government made many promises to Kurds after the Baas Regime was destroyed, said that a direct referendum had been decided following the fight against DEAŞ soon after the disaster in Sincar.
Barzani, who said that he wanted to determine his fate peacefully and democratically for the protection and development of the IKBY people, said, "With the documents, Iraq is unable to protect or protect us like a state."
"He doesn't want us to move forward". he defended his view.
Reacting that the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons during the fight against the terrorist organization DEAŞ, but that Hashdi Shabi, established with a fatwa in a short period of time, was immediately legalized and all weapons were supplied, Barzani noted.
Within Iraq's defense system, the Peshmerge was not dealt with.
The central government did not do what it presented to Hashdi Shabi to Peshmerge.
According to the constitution, the Peshmerge is considered part of Iraq's defence system.
However, when Hashdi Shabi had no existence in the constitution, all possibilities were mobilized by breaking the law.
We're not saying we're against Hashdi Shabi.
Peshmerge and Hashdi Shabi fought on the same front, but why is Hashdi Shabi being legalized while the presence of the Peshmerge and the fight against terrorism being covered up?
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On 3 August 2014, the terrorist organization DEAŞ launched an attack on the Ezidi living in Sincar district in Mosul, killing many people including women and children.
10 minutes back from the disaster.
The Boeing 777 passenger aircraft of Air France airlines was west of Hokkaido in northern Japan while North Korea's missile was in the air, the BBC reported.
Officials noted that the missile crashed into the area where it was located 10 minutes ago, saying it was estimated that the missile was within 100 to 150 kilometers of the plane.
Air France said the missile did not intersect the plane's course and there was no problem with the flight in question.
"The information we have at this stage shows that the missile crashed into the sea more than 100 kilometers from the plane's course".
Is nothing sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most precise sign of regime change is that they begin to attack statues.
Americans know as much about this as anyone; as well as the carefully staged Saddam Hussein toppled at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003...
Stephen Miller, one of the key theorists of the Trump regime, knew exactly what CNN's Jim Acosta and the president were doing while symbolically destroying the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate over proposals to strictly restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
If he did, he'd be lynched by a bunch of boat tour owners and a Freedom Copycat.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed, Emma Lazarus' famous poem was attributed to it after it was added to the memorial base.
Miller, on his way out to Acosta, said: "I don't want to talk history from beginning to end here, but the Statue of Liberty... is the ridiculous symbol of American freedom to the world.
The poem you mentioned was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller's actually right, but like he said, it's really not about history.
This is about the contemporary reverberation of Lazarus' eerie words, not only does a state in them seem to be inviting some elderly immigrants but also the poor poor of the poor: "Tired, poor, / stuffed masses longing to breathe freedom, / the wretched unwanted of packed land."
There's never been a time when the "unwanted one" was so visible on our screens.
Miller did not bring any literary criticism; it explained that these people were not welcome in Trump's United States.
The conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: this is actually a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus and his friends, who campaigned to put his words on the bottom of the statue after his death, knew very well that they were taking quite a political action.
The statue intended to celebrate the connections between French and American republicanism by representing them in a trite metaphor, by representing them with the presence of Freedom in the form of a woman.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in his poetry the figure of a woman was no longer abstract, but had a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: The Mother of Exiles.
The marriage of poetry to image is a brilliant feminist blow and a devastating attack on American anti-immigrantism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, so did the right-wingers for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, a big braggart who was Baptist John-style for Trump's arrival, argued that Liber8 did not invite anyone in in 2010 but rather an early era neocon who kept American fire in the dark world: "Mrs. Freedom is coming forward.
He exists to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Not to light the way for the United States of America."
Unusually, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The sculpture's meaning was all about the perception angle.
Lazarus' magnificent creative act was to see it as being seen after long and often terrible journeys by exhausted, but hopeless people on the decks of ships.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who were looking for shelter and wanted to improve their lives.
His statue responded to them with words of hope and warm reception that they needed to hear.
Of course, that's not a perspective Miller and Trump would justify in any way.
Their torch is not to guide, but to incite their only source of power, hatred.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle only remembers when two Scots were able to join the Great Britain team.
Neil Black, the United Kingdom Athletics performance director, says the 16-man Scottish group in the World Championship squad will "provide a huge contribution to the team".
The record-numbered Scottish athlete was selected for London 2017, which began on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that United Kingdom athletics should learn from it.
"We embrace it and we try to understand it and we will try until we get out of it," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish Athletics thinks it's about what they're doing.
British athletics: He thinks it has something to do with what they do.
So's the guy on the street around the corner.
Whatever the combination of conditions, this is absolutely wonderful."
Many Scottish athletes, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in 5000 m, are competing for the medal, while Eilidh Doyle was selected by the squad as captain.
"Eilidh is a bit modest.
The captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"No matter what Scotland or wherever they live or practice, a few athletes came out of that room very proud and really motivated.
The passion and real feeling Eilidh naturally added was wonderful."
A silver medalist from the Commonwealth, who will compete in the 400 m hurdles at his fifth World Championships, calls 16 Scots "unbelievable" to be on the British team.
Scotland's best total athlete figure in previous world championships was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Mid-distance runner Muir, who set five British and two European records last year, leads.
He's going to join 1500 m and 5000 m.
Chris O'Hare, who had a very good season, including the British Team trials and victories at the Year Cycle Games, is another Scotsman to watch at 1500 m.
Doyle remembers his first championship, when Lee McConnell was the only other Scotsman on the team.
The team captain says he is "very proud" with the move, as many of his compatriots will not only enter the team but will compete for the medal in some cases and will fight for the finals.
"The special thing about being team captain was that it was with votes given by other members of the team, so it was already a great honor but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me," he added.
"Obviously, I'm proud of all the Scots who made the team.
That's how far we've come.
And they're here as self-proportionated athletes, looking out for the podium.
What about the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we were very lucky in this situation, in this regard, that we have a World Championship in our home.
I mean, it's really just the impact of being able to take advantage of this indoor support and the fact that we're back at Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to get up there and fight, and there's going to be such a great atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for state office if you can't take criticism from voters
Our country's father had some information about being negative in the press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start critically criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was disturbed by the criticism.
But he did not silence those who criticized him.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Free speech can be eliminated and we can be dragged to slaughter in a stupid and quiet manner."
That brings me to Larry Hogan, governor of Maryland, who has to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the sharing of at least 450 people expressing their ideas on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Association also sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff ignored the case on the grounds that it was not serious, and online comments were filled with responses "Who cares?"
A lot of people said, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
When you're like Hogan, it's especially important.
It's a Republican governor who's surprisingly popular in a state that's overwhelmingly Democratic.
It has the second highest approval rate of 50 governors in the country.
Hogan's not a reactionary lunatic.
He excelled in leading his state and in strict devotion to principles.
He was also quite skilled at using Facebook as the primary tool to bond with his constituents, with his post-Chemotherapy hairless head making a playful introduction.
So it's unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to stop people from coming to the governor's page, which is a public forum, which is officially described and tax dollars paid by staff members.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than organizing them.
But it's very easy to use images of trolls or spamists or haters attacking online verbally.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are the real people who only talk to their elected leader: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor; not a troll.
They all said their comments were not respectful, thoughtful and abusive.
In his share, the pastor quoted a Bible, addressing Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie, was not hateful but asked about hate crimes.
He wrote to the commentary section of The Post's news that "I was kindly disappointed that he had not responded to his hate crimes and other recent news."
"I also don't like the idea of many people being ignored as a so-called collective effort rather than a large group of concerned citizens when they comment on the same issue."
What the governor's staff calls a "intensified spam attack", others will probably call it "the idea advocacy".
The Facebook period makes it easy to appropriate a message through the blocking of a dissident or deletion of a negative message.
It is much cleaner than in the old days when the staff were sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical writings or arrest and silence protesters.
But, digitally, that's exactly what's happening.
Hogan is not the first public mission to be criticized for neutralising Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked in the Twitter stream.
One of the decisions that might be a reference to this issue came from Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun Administration District acted contrary to the First Constitutional Amendment when he banned a voter on Facebook, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria.
In Kentucky, he was also visited by the ACLU due to the use of Governor Matt Bevin (Republican), Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the reasonably priced postage era had quite a similar effect on the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letterwriters eroded his leadership.
Even then, Washington had trolls with unknown names.
People who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius", and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that put Washington's decisions under their feet.
According to the online George Washington Articles Project, which collected historical documents, petitions with Britain had overwhelmed the office of petitions criticizing its stance on the Friendship, Trade and Navigation Agreement.
But he didn't shut them up.
The freedom of expression, opposition and recrimination is at the very core of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes he'll be at the Renaissance Club in the comfort of his home.
Ronan Rafferty, a former European number one, hopes that in the next three days, the Renaissance Club in South Lothian will be in the comfort of his home while hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, the next door leads to the final, Northern Ireland feels a commitment to the new venue and acts as the tournament's envoy on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, "I watched the construction of the Renaissance Club and we see that it has achieved its glory along with this organization."
The players will see the field in its best form, in an extraordinary state.
Jerry did a remarkable job of building this place.
He's a staunch advocate of this game and he's proud of his success here.
This is a great show for this field."
Although British Eales has won both the Europen Tour and the European Challenge Tour, he will fight for the first time in his 32-year career to preserve a championship.
"This feels really special," Southport-based player said.
"I never had a chance to protect the Extreme Open because it had been removed from the calendar after the year I won.
It's good to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Memories come back from last year, and winning for me and my wife Sharon last year was very special.
It was really a special and always a loving moment."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 at the beginning of this year, is also returning to the game in his own field.
This organization will be the first Scottish competition since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you struggle inside," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played some real golf.
I'm happy to go so far."
In the field, the three participants are former Masters champions Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The attendance is free and there is a parking lot; £5 per car with one person and £10 per car with two or more people.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
I found the answer.
Imagine a "seat" whose budget, with 6 billion 867 million Turkish liras, is more than budgeted for each of eleven ministries, including Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism Ministries!
The number of personnel is 117,378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the Presidency of Religious Affairs!
Yes, I'm going to talk about Mehmet Gözr, Head of Religious Affairs!
For days... I've been looking for answers to the question in my head...
I wonder why Mehmet Gömör was taken from his seat...
I've read every article about her being sent.
Nope.
I can't figure out the answer to the question I'm looking for.
It's only this year...
Mehmet Gözör prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DIB).
A US$1 million S 600 Mercedes was withdrawn by President Erdogan.
So he didn't have a problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You could say, "He's served seven years. Isn't that enough?"
The first DIB President, M. Rifat Börekçi, served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz, as you all know, sat in that chair for 11 years.
So... the president's term is clear.
Back to my question: why did Mehmet Göz leave his seat?
It's down to business...
Shia closeness
The source close to the power said - "According to traditional instruction, Mehmet Arız did not claim circumcision!"
The code for this sentence is: he didn't claim the Sunnism!
The person who put that sentence behind him said, "He was found modernist by traditional ulema!"
I mean, Mehmet Göz was seen as innovative.
What do you mean, innovative?
The answer to the question was hidden on a trip abroad by Mehmet Gömör.
Date: December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Gömör went to Iran to attend the 29th Vahdet Conference, which will be held in Tehran -- intended to bring the Islamic denominations closer.
He met with Ayatollah Ali Hamaney, the religious leader of Iran.
And he prayed, taking ranks with the Shi'ite.
And at the conference, he said: "The cults are human schools that represent different ideas and opinions in the understanding of Islamic religion, formed over time".
Each of them intends to set a course for Allah.
Each one is in the pathway of the main road, but their destination is the same.
It is unacceptable to equate sect with religion or to see sectarianism above Islamic belonging.
Separation based on the sect is a reflection of jurisprudence and conflict and ignorance.
It has been the religion itself that has been most damaged in the circumstances in which the sects have been preempted by religion...
I'd like to stress again by underlining:
The Shia and the Sunni are one nation.
"No one can contradict another because he perceives Islam as he understands it."
A year later...
Only Jaferi leader Selahattin from Turkey attended the 30th Vahdet Meeting in original.
I mean...
It's not Sunnism. It's Vehhabik.
Mehmet Gözör's trip to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of "traditional uleme".
It was this -- again -- that no one attended the next Tehran conference representing the Turkish State.
After all, Mehmet Gözör had been invited four times since he took office.
The reason was obvious; Shia in the DIB - anti-Iranian "traditional ulema!"
Immediately following the Iranian trip, Mehmet Gözör's seat began to be worn out from the start of 2016.
Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş was in charge of the DIB!
Mehmet Göz was so drowned that he wanted "to commit to the DİB Presidency".
It's basically...
There was a difference within the state in the way of looking at Sunnism.
Some of the theoretical worlds created in the Saudi Arabian and Egyptian madrases "traditional ulema" identified Sunnism—in the US shadow—with Vehhabi-Selephilic!
These were anti-Iranians who didn't even tolerate the trip to Tehran.
It was not surprising what Ahmet the robe said about Mehmet Gömzur: "There has never been any danger to Religion.'
And that my Lord may give the people of the land a goodly chieftain, and he shall be true to their faith.
They used "Ehlisinnet" as a symbol concept of Iranian hostility.
At one point, FETÖ -- supported by the CIA -- now ran the anti-Iranian opposition under new names.
And with FETÖ conspiracies...
A photo of a young man with whiskey was served to the media with the lie "Son of Mehmet Gömör"!
What a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Gömör in the media: Turkey, the newspaper of the U.S.-driven Congregation of Lighters!
After all...
- The one who resisted bringing Sunnism to the Saudi Vehhabi-Self line...
- That doesn't fuel sectarian separation...
- Modernist... a clergyman whose consciousness was destroyed by the "traditional ulema" created during the Cold War...
U.S. cultural imperialism continues to quickly Arabise Turkey (making Vehhabi-Self).
Don't doubt that the next head of Religious Affairs will be a Vehhabi-Self representative!
"We support Turkey's protection of sovereignty"
Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu has gone to China to make an official visit.
Çavuşoğlu and Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi held a joint press conference at the State Guest House in Beijing.
"We hope Turkey will participate more actively in international issues," Vang said.
China will support Turkey in its efforts to maintain sovereignty, stability and security.
"On the issue of Palestine, we hope it will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey," he said.
Çavuşoğlu said of the Shanghai Co-operation Organization, "Turkey is in search of close cooperation with regional and international organisations, not an alternative to each other, but its complement".
The spirit officially begins its second term
The presidency of Hassan Ruhani, who won the May presidential elections in Iran, was approved by country leader Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
Hasan Ruhani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, was sworn in at a ceremony attended by the country's religious leader Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
Turkish Ambassador to Tehran Reza Hakan Tekin attended the ceremony, attended by top military and political figures as well as foreign representatives.
Ruhani, who will serve as president for another four years, will officially take office following a swearing-in ceremony in parliament on Saturday (August 5th).
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, representing Turkey, is expected to attend the ceremony.
Security measures at the Cirve-Eye Border Gate
Trucks carrying supplies, except humanitarian aid, food, medicine, cleaning supplies, will not be allowed through the Cilve-Eye Border Gate in Hatay's Reyhanli district.
According to reports, due to the negative security conditions at the Babel Air Border Gate and its region, the Cilveeye Border Gate has been closed to transports outside humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning.
And they're allowed to release the aid trucks from the Cirve-Eye Border Gate.
No information was given as to how long the limitation would take.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Land
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove when she cooks.
He rarely even uses a pot.
The housewife puts a sweet potato directly on fire, usually known locally as "nota", in the restless region of Indonesia in Papua, Enarotali in the regency of Paniai.
Half an hour later, the embossed lump is removed and wiped out with appetite, hands unwashed.
Degei sits on the muddy floor where he does chores, such as washing laundry with blurry water from the nearby swamp, with no furniture.
It acts like a bucket of field toilets in a house without a roof.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was never assigned a position in any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed and most drink too much, and then there are soldiers.
"No one walks around the village after 5:00 p.m."
After a controversial referendum in which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote by force before the troops invaded, a rare instant glimpse of daily life in the mountainous areas of Papua, a former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia in 1969.
An existing movement, which is propaganda for independence against the Dutch administration, quickly directed its anger towards the Jakarta government, which maintains strict control over the region, bans foreign journalists or rights surveillance organisations.
In 2003, the area was officially separated as Papua and West Papua, as independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
The enarotali is as remote as it is; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the regional capital, Jayapura, to Nabire, and a five-hour drive that shakes the stomach with a rental vehicle.
No public transport.
The 19,000-strong town contains wooden houses fenced with bamboo fences, crumpled iron roofs turned into various yellowish brown tones by rust.
Few Indonesians have traveled here, let alone journalists, and hardly any foreigners have traveled here.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago worshipped the Papuans, a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei said, referring to his vibrant, hand-tied turban, dark shirt and shiny skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have the worst child death and literacy rates in Asia.
But this is also the golden land of Indonesia.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous area in the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted about $3.1 billion in gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
However, these riches, a source of misery for the Papuans, allow Indonesia's powerful army to sustain a suffocating presence.
The New York Times' 2005 study reports that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units from 1998 to 2004, including up to $150,000 in sums given to a single officer.
The Papuans' call for more autonomy threatens this golden spawning chicken and is ruthlessly out of their rights.
More than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969, according to rights advocates.
Mass killings in the mountainous parts of Papua in the 1970s reached genocide figures according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested over 3900 peaceful demonstrators in the area only last year.
The Brisbane Archdiocese's 2016 report "We Will Lose Everything" includes testimony of the mesemony, which was committed the previous year, such as illegal executions, torture (according to another report, especially popular with rape and electricity), and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims every week because there are incidents," says Human Rights Watch's Indonesian researcher Andreas Harsono.
Pressures were increased as Papua's sources brought settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The region has an 83% Christian population of 3.5 million, but demographics are changing as Muslim immigrants from the crowded Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi arrive for economic purposes.
Javanese warung kiosks sell gado-gados served with peanut sauce mixed with fried chicken and vegetables.
Locals are having a hard time competing.
"The migrants sell chickens and vegetables cheaper in traditional markets than the native Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to the regional capital Jayapura for business.
"This caused local Papuans, Papua mama-mamas (women) to lose markets."
The Indonesian president Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, promised to solve inequalities and rights violations in Papua in the 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter took the vote of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Panaia, as he moved along the road to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But very little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in anticipation that justice would fulfill our hope that it would be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered his worst condition only two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children broke through two Indonesian soldiers on the motorcycle while singing Christmas songs in front of a bonfire in Enarotali.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers resented their style and according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said that soldiers who had been drinking chased the group and beat them with their rifles' bottoms.
Then one of the soldiers fired on the group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, had been beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire and events escalated the next day.
As many as 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered to demand justice in a football field in front of the local police station and military command center.
They were carrying ceremonial hunting springs and danced the waita dance of Papua's Mee Pago tribe (running in the form of a public and mimicking the bird song).
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police and the military garrison.
As the nerves grew more tense, orders were sent to soldiers via internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them and kill them." An official document seen by TIME, which was not released to the local media, said so.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the impending danger and demanded calm by crying out to the crowd to return home.
No one had any intention of listening.
On the porch of the wood house painted with bright colors, he told TIME, "When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist."
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot, but he says the bullet came from the assembled military contractor.
"It was a crowd, many shots fired," he adds.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the attacks, the native Alfius Youw was shot three times.
Like many Indonesians, Yohanes, known only by one name, told TIME negatively, "I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him."
"I saw him die...I kissed him."
Inspector General Yotje Mende, Chief of Police of Papua, told reporters that his officers had only "secured" the outpost because the outpost was under attack.
"When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves," said Department Director Pudjo Sulistio, a spokesman for Papua police.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were also injured.
News of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Jokowi gave an enthusiastic speech in Jayapura three weeks later, stating that he shared the pain of his victim families and promising to solve historical abuses in Papua.
He said, "I want this case resolved immediately so there won't be another one."
Secretary of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he had set up a non-judicial mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some in the '90s and some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are determined to solve these violations but we have processes to go through," said the director of the press.
Speaking to TIME on June 5, Wiranto stepped back saying there was no plan to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be resolved by the law."
Wiranto, who B.M. accused of "crimes against humanity" over 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had already been solved.
The families of the Paniai victims met such claims with bitter skepticism.
"I've been interviewed four times in the past three years but there's been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living in fear years later.
He says, "I'm scared."
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the soldier, afraid of getting shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterates the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the soldier after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the soldier came looking for me," he says.
The attacks haven't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police in Paniai's neighbour Deiyai regency fired on villagers.
One person was killed during the conflict between villagers and the director of a construction company who refused to help transport a man who was not himself to the hospital, and 17 others including children were injured.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's construction site office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the officers, and they reacted by firing warning shots.
But the locals say that the moving brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
Dominggu Badii, 29, who lived close to the hospital and witnessed the injuries being raised, tells TIME, "We were so panicked, we were afraid that there would be revenge."
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament called for the officers involved to be held responsible and the moving police brigade to withdraw from the area.
Paniai has always been a troubled area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribal peoples, who live scattered along Papua's green mountainous center.
Many joined the rebel army Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claimed to protect the rights of the Papuans by random attacks and by raids of kidnappings on Indonesian soldiers.
Some top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and held arbitraryly by the soldier in recent years under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some of them are never seen again.
Among the Papua peoples, Paniai is known as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
A little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
The bread is inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly notes, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women who can sustain four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the harvest for the family, selling the rest in the local market.
Ten notes are only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities between local Papuanians and new immigrants who have come in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport have grown.
The already underprivileged jobs often go to immigrants who are better educated and richer.
The Papuans rarely have capitalism or necessary qualifications to run their own business competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, head of the Panai tribal council.
The isolation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
Furthermore, the limitations of reporting for the international media remain tight.
At the beginning of this year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for "a lack of co-ordination with relevant institutions", despite the rare permission to make videos given to them.
According to Human Rights Watch Asian Deputy Director Phelim Kine, Jokowi's promises to remove and develop news-making restrictions were not carried out to increase election campaign transparency.
In a statement, he said, "There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to make news from the restless eastern end provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua: visa rejection and blacklisting."
The lack of press inspection means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to its neighbors near Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) encouraged the B.M. Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries historically support the OPM.
"In Indonesia, the democratic system is still valid and there is free media, so the evidence in human rights cases is difficult to cover," said Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to reporters in Jakarta, ignoring the group's claims.
Locals want more foreign governments interested.
An official delegation from the Netherlands broke its silence when it visited Jayapura on 4 May, headed by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, according to a source who attended the meeting and did not want its name to be announced, with the locals pleading, "We want freedom."
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say it is unlikely they will ever vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions but is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack," says Gobai, head of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai are rolling in fakru necessity with small education and health care, except to live under the imminent threat of the bully soldier.
Like other Papuans, Gobai says, he sees the Paniai people as a "loan" they give to Jokowi to pay his own votes back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidations, the families of the Paniai attack victims carried out a final act of symbolic resistance: do not bury the body of a victim on the property directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be done, they will at least make sure that those responsible do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been murdered," says Yacobus, with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
The fire has surrounded Dubai's 'The Torch' skyscraper for the second time
On Friday in Dubai, a fire swept through the world's tallest residential towers, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 79-story structure, 337 metres long.
This is the second major fire in two years that quickly spread to the tall building, called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no explanation was made about the cause of the major fire.
"We were asleep and woke up to a fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and took about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George spoke thus to Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said the fire brigade extinguished the large fire around 4 a.m. local time (00 GMT) and that they were cooling the building.
The government has announced that they are trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This can raise questions about the safety of the material used in the outer parts of high buildings around the world.
The torch management's investigation following the 2015 fire found that most of the damage was on the coating, i.e. outside panels used for decoration and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed that London's isolation and coating panel system on the Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire there.
News of 'social aid' to more than 4,000 chronic patients
The Ministry of Family and Social Policies will benefit 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients in the first phase from the outreach programme for poor citizens and families struggling with chronic diseases.
The Ministry, which plans to provide patients with monthly support over two thirds of the minimum wage, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to information, details and implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Who Fight Chronic Diseases", which began work some time ago under the direction of Family and Social Policy Minister Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, have been established.
The outreach program, launched in support of citizens struggling with chronic diseases in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, with economic and psychological difficulties, is also the first in the world in many ways.
Having completed all preparations for the launch of the programme, the Ministry will also provide regular psychosocial support to families with the outreach program, not only cash.
It is thus intended that poor citizens with chronic illness and continuing their treatments in their homes and their families will not be left alone both financially and spiritually.
According to studies, poor citizens struggling with Subakut Sklerozan Panencephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and measles, will be given regular psychosocial and cash as part of the new outreach program.
Later in the programme, poor citizens struggling with other rare and risky diseases will be covered by the aid programme.
In addition to the support planned to be given at a rate of over two-thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments can be made to tuberculosis patients, who are not able to take care of their medical self-care, who are living off the bed as dependents, or who are identified by the relevant health unit for the need to improve home living conditions.
In order to benefit from the support, the household is seeking the requirement that the monthly income per capita be less than two thirds of the monthly net worth of the minimum wage.
In addition, citizens with SSPE sufferers need to have a health board report held according to the procedure and the basics outlined in the "Ordinance on Disability Measurement, Classification and Health Board Reports to the Disabled".
According to the survey, more than 1 out of 5 U.S. passengers are bringing banned substances to the plane.
According to the survey conducted with airline passengers, more than 20 per cent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled banned substances from the U.S. Transportation Security Agency checkpoints, including at least 6 per cent carrying banned knives or other sharp objects.
Less than 1 percent later claimed to have discovered that he had accidentally traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
Research conducted by a jet rental service called Stratos Jet Charters has also found that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
19.7% of respondents admitted to trying to fly on purpose with something banned by the TSA are from the Y generation, but less than 15 are members of the X generation.
The most common substances deliberately smuggled from TSA agents are food and fluids.
More than 3 percent knowingly admitted to passing sharp instruments from security, while 2.2% of female participants and 3.7 percent of male participants also admitted that they deliberately carried banned drugs on board.
The firm said that several people from airport security accidentally polled passengers across the country to find out how many people brought contraband and how many did it on purpose.
Whether it's on purpose or not, it's not a surprise that the most likely people to pass contraband through security are the most flying.
Nevertheless, as the firm points out, the TSA rules are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of what liquids or how much of them they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of material confiscated by the TSA came out as banned fluids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international ones.
China welcomes US statements
At a press conference in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi said that they were not interested in Tillerson's statements, referring to the Pyongyang administration, "the regime change, the collapse of the regime, the rapid reunification of the peninsula, and the search for excuses to send our troops north of the 38th parallel".
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang expressed hope that Tillerson again emphasized the principles of the Washington administration regarding the North Korean issue, that the United States would apply those principles effectively and within a concrete result-oriented policy.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is their priority, Vang stressed that they expect the parties to find the middle way in which they can solve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration has been persistent about denuclearising the peninsula, maintaining peace and stability, resolving problems by dialogue and negotiation.
EPA President Pruitt Stops Delaying Obama Era Emission Deduction Laws
The day after its lawsuit by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Organization, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obamaian-era laws, which dropped air pollutant emissions causing dirty smoke.
Pruitt represented change with his own organization being more sensitive to the needs of state environmental regulators than past administrations.
He never mentioned a legal objection to his previous position in a federal supreme court.
The issue is that states begin to meet October 1st, the end of 2015 standards for ground level ozone.
Pruitt had announced to his organisation that he would postpone June compatibility for a year to give more time to work the plan and to avoid "intervention of local decisions or blocking economic growth".
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, Oklahoma's state's attorney general, had long served as a trusted ally against tighter environmental regulations.
Pruitt has acted repeatedly since arriving in Washington to block or delay regulations opposed by chemistry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change is Pruitt's latest legal defeat for the organization's reorganization agenda.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA executive's attempt to delay the practice demanding that oil and gas companies, an Obama administration law, oversee and reduce methane leaks was to exceed the limits of its own authority.
In a Wednesday evening statement, Pruitt said his return to ozone standards only strengthened the EPA's commitment to work through complex processes to meet new standards with states on time.
Pruitt, who sued the EPA over a dozen times in his previous job, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the final dates of decisions, waiting to be sued by activist groups and others, and agreeing to settle the dispute to set the timings for the decision."
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take seriously the dates of the term.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPA's statement said that Pruitt could once again use his "delaying authority and all the other legally available authority" to ensure that regulations are "supported by sound policies and the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pressing for a broader rewrite of ozone laws.
A Parliamentary bill approved last month seeks to delay the implementation of 2015 laws by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate for a vote.
New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "The EPA's change of resolution following our cases is an important gain for the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by 6.7 million New Yorkers and the dirty smoke flowing into their communities."
The case involved participation in New York City from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington and District of Columbia.
When general pollutants are released by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical facilities, and other sources reacting to sunlight in the atmosphere, the ground level ozone is produced.
The resulting smoke can cause serious breathing problems in a fast-affected group of people, and contributes to thousands of early deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise decision change.
Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity said, "It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this discreet step from the person in charge of protecting the air we breathe."
"We must continue to fight against the ideological struggle of the Trump administration to flatter the environment and its interest groups."
Inflation single digits
Turkey, which caught the largest increase in exports in 6 years in July, drew unemployment, which was 13 per cent in January to 10.5 per cent in April, and the economic confidence index also rose to the top of 3.5 years, also reduced inflation to one household.
The Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) rose 0.15 per cent in July, while annual inflation fell to one household for the first time since January with 9.79 per cent, according to data released yesterday by the Turkish Statistical Agency (TUK).
As of main spending groups, in July, the highest increase on the monthly basis was seen at 1.75 percent in the restaurant and hotel group, while the group that dropped the most was clothing and shoes with 3.51 percent.
The highest annual increase was in the transport group at 15.24 percent.
"Inflation has an impact on moderate travel, the decline in prices of food and clothing groups," said Business Investment Economist Muammer Coalcuoglu, who noted that inflation had declined in parallel to expectations in July.
However, the core indicators are rising in comparison to the previous month, as opposed to the headline.
"We don't expect there to be a relaxation in the firm stance of the Central Bank," he said.
Despite the decline in headline inflation, core inflation indicators have risen.
The B index rose from 9.07 per cent in July to 9.46 per cent and the C index from 9.20 per cent to 9.60 per cent.
Capital FX Assistant Director of Research Enver Erkan said inflation could be shut down at 9.3 per cent of the year, while "Inflation could fluctuate by December and fall into one household in December."
He made a statement that "the Central Bank may have an opportunity as of the early months of 2018."
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek: Inflation will close its year in one household.
The tightening of the Central Bank will continue until inflation drops below 7%.
We will give the final form of reforms to the nearby Food Committee.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci: We are delighted that inflation has fallen to single digits, but this has to become permanent.
In the fight against inflation, food prices need to be lowered as well as increased supply.
Development Minister Lütfi Elvan: A number of upward trends can be seen in annual inflation due to the base effect in the coming months, but the decline in inflation from the early 2018 months will be evident.
We're predicting that annual inflation will go even lower.
I wish Fenerbahçe good luck in their next match.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said their performance in the second half was not enough to jump the lap in a 1–1 draw with Fenerbahçe in the UEFA European League 3rd qualifying round rematch.
"We couldn't use the wings in the first half," Foda said at a press conference after the encounter, noting that Fenerbahçe was a top-level team.
In the second half, we came up with a balance in the game.
We've got a chance for a second goal.
I'm still proud of my team.
They changed the course of the game in the second half.
We could've been a little better.
Little things became a decision-making within the match.
"I wish Fenerbahçe good luck in their next match," he said.
As long as they are in Turkey, they feel very well and are happy with the hospitality they see, Foda said.
Fernando is in Istanbul
Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, where the Galatasaray Club began their transfer talks, arrived in Istanbul.
The fans enthusiastically welcomed the Brazilian footballer who arrived at Atatürk Airport.
Fernando, where yellow-red fans performed a show of love with cheers, left the airport, riding on the special vehicle waiting for him under security measures.
Fernando, 30, who started his career on Brazil's Vila Nova team, plays for Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City, serves in the midfield.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after passing a health check.
Continuing his transfer work, Galatasaray secured an agreement with Manchester City for 5 million and 250,000 euros for Fernando, whom he had long sought to recruit.
Flash Rakka move from the United States: Homeland Security Force...
Colonel Dillon, who was linked to the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) with video conference management from Baghdad, stated that Rakka Homeland Security Force (RIGG), trained by the coalition, had begun settling in areas cleared of DEAŞ in the city.
"The Rakka Homeland Security Force, composed mostly of Arabs and anti-DAASH local volunteers in cleared areas of the city, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from fleeing or returning," Dillon said.
Dillon expressed that he had joined the group by completing 230 more training this week, stating that "the number of forces in question at the moment is 850".
Dillon said the group was trained by the coalition on basic weapons training as well as first aid, armed conflict, screening and checkpoint operations.
The coalition will continue to scan applicants for training and employment, Dillon said, adding that interest in the Rakka Homeland Security Force was very intense.
The US-led coalition is co-operating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which created the PYD/PKK's main backbone in the acquisition of Rakka.
The PYD/PKK terrorist organization had appointed a PKK terrorist named Leyla Muhammad as co-chair of the Rakka civil administration council.
The military force in Rakka allegedly includes members of the PKK/PYD.
Dillon also announced that the U.S.-led coalition had collected heavy weapons from the opposition group Şeheda Karyateyn (Shuhuk) in the southern Syrian camp of El Tanif, where it cut its support last week.
"After meeting with their leader last week, Shuhuk brought back the heavy weapons and equipment the coalition had given them but some small guns and light vehicles were allowed to remain in them".
The United States announced last week that it had withdrawn its support from Shuhuk on the grounds that it patrolled outside the non-conflict zones they had agreed on with Russia and was involved in activities that were not associated with the DEAŞ.
The group wants to fight the DEAŞ as well as the Bashar Esed regime, it is said.
According to leaked phone calls notes, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
Notes of phone calls between U.S. president Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders were leaked by the Washington Post.
On January 27, in a phone call with Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump pinned him down about not publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States scolded the Mexican president, who publicly put the wall on the ball, and said, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on building a wall along the southern border of the United States and promised Mexico he would pay for the project.
Notes of his first meeting with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, which revealed a heated dialogue, were also published.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the agreement on the United States to take refugees to Australia was "stupid", "stupid" and "stupid", and that the agreement under Obama would make him look like a "dumb" after offering a ban on placing a refugee in the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the conversation by telling Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant speech I've had all day."
The patient's relatives broke the doctor's nose.
Turkey's High Residency Education and Research Hospital doctors and employees left short-term work yesterday morning in response to the beating of a fellow physician by their relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the hospital main entrance, with "no violence in health" in their hands, reacted to the incident.
The hospital's Children's Cardiology Clinical Chief, Prof. Dr. Fezza Ayşenur Paç, said, "The slogan "No violence in health" seems to me insufficient or even side motto."
There's no place for violence in health.
"If this goes on like this, these people will soon find no health group to serve themselves," he said.
Ankara Provincial Health Director Dr. Kamil Türkmen, Ankara First District Public Hospitals General Secretary Prof. Dr. Önder Odabaş, Turkey High Residency Education and Research Hospital Chief Medical Officer Prof. Mustafa Paç and the hospital relatives have also supported the action.
Condemning the incident, Paç said:
Unfortunately, violence is increasing for health workers.
We experienced an example of this yesterday (the day before) when our cardiovascular surgeon was beaten by a patient relative.
Although we have taken whatever measures we can as our government, our ministry, and our governorship to end these events quickly, we demand that our people also increase their sensitivity to this issue.
I condemn yesterday's events on behalf of my hospital and my medical staff.
Noting that society should be conscious of violence in health, Odabas said, "Unfortunately, this time has become an occupational complication that we have experienced."
"We will also take our own precautions, but most importantly, our nation's own health care".
"Our laws on violence in health have come out effectively enough," Turkmen said, noting that the judicial process on the incident has begun.
The ranks of the government apply it.
He's doing security work right now.
In the past, these have always been idle, but right now it's a direct public case, and the state is assigning lawyers, following the case.
He used the phrase "there are also severe punishment samples taken on this one."
Following the statements, employees continued their work.
The incident allegedly occurred around 5:45 p.m. the previous day.
The relatives of the patient who died in intensive care attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Uzbek, who worked in the Department of Heart and Damar Surgery, who reported his death.
Uzbek was suspended from the scene by doctors and assistants; police were called to the hospital.
Uzbek’s nose was broken in the incident, while the attackers were taken into custody.
One of the witnesses said:
When our friend went to his relatives to inform them of the condition of a patient who had died, the patient held our friend responsible and us responsible and attacked two of our friends.
Our friend's nose is broken, he's covered in blood.
Then we took our friend into the O.R. and hid him.
We had security set up for 15 or 20 minutes.
If the patient's relatives had broken through that firewall, something much worse would have happened.
Heavy impact on DEAŞ in Gaziantep: 102 sacks...
According to the report, 5,100 kilograms of ammonium nitrate was seized in the 102 sacks used to build explosives as a result of an operation conducted by Gaziantep Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office.
In the operation, where six people were detained, the suspects had their residence, workplaces, warehouses, and upper search for 10 long-barreled guns, 35 cartridges belonging to these guns, 2,370 loaded cartridges, three pistols, seven cartridges belonging to this pistol, and 382 loaded cartridges, two shotguns and one machete, 39, 705 Euros, and 15,870) USD, a total of USD, with a total of $16,000 worth of different bills, 40,500 worth of checks, and a large number of digital books.

The suspects were arrested by the Magistrate's Court.
YPG looting in Syria...
The United States intervened
According to local sources by the AA, YPG terrorists looted the homes of residents of Tel Semin, in the northern countryside of Rakka, where it entered on the basis of fighting the terrorist group DEAŞ, under US military support.
The response of the civilians whose homes had been looted and confiscated turned into a conflict with the terrorist organization.
The U.S. forces in the area entered the town in armoured vehicles.
"Cougar MRAP" type armoured, personnel carrier vehicles, and Husky type mine detection vehicles appeared to have created a buffer zone in the area.
The terrorist organisation, the YPG, does not allow civilians fleeing death in Rakka, which is under fire as part of the anti-DEAŞ operation, to enter the cities under its control.
The local activist network "Rakka is quietly being slaughtered" had announced yesterday, only in July, that 121 civilians were killed in the organization's artillery fire.
Let's not carry the old world's fights to tomorrow
Delayed perception of dorm and world truths can lead to crises, not just plain people.
One of the reasons why the backward East, which we call "songness", perceives world truths by delay, may be that the reflection of these facts into the geography of the East is blocked by certain focuses, or beyond reality announced.
Don Quixote and Oblomov have also been the subject of the literary world to perceive facts and change by delay or not to perceive it at all.
Cervantes' "Don Quixote" is a madzept who still thinks he's a knight in the turn when the bourgeoisie begins to form.
Or Gonçarov's "Oblomov", a lazy heir who thinks that when he ignores the facts, things can go on as they used to.
The Chinese example, for example, was closed down by the end of the 15th century when China was an open country and dominated by the seas, resulting in a conservative dynasty taking the throne.
This has lasted until the execution of the captains of boats out of Chinese landwater.
We Turks, with one foot, eye and ear in the West, the other foot, eye and ear in the East, have had constant dilemmas in understanding facts and change, starting with the Ottomans.
An old and new chapter of us has tried to move yesterday into the present, to understand the present with the concepts that fit the old conditions, to think of the present as tomorrow.
One part of us has been able to act as quickly as the focus of thinking in developed countries in terms of understanding the facts of the land and the world, as well as perception of change.
This has been a source of constant conflict, tension.
Medrese and the university, the neonovela and the modern army, the encounters of doubt with faith, caused a dramatic dualism.
Progress also gets old, and even worse, the new and advanced stances at one time were not accepted that certain times would eventually wear out and remain behind.
After a period, yesterday's progressives began to declare the new and advanced "Dangerous", while those who tried to interpret dorm and world conditions in accordance with the current reality declared "The Renegade".
The most important lesson was that in the Ottomans, those who perceived the truths of the land and the world by delay, eventually dominated thought and state life, the empire was disbanded, collapsed, and the people became poor.
The most important lesson our Ottoman past passed on to the Republic was the fact that the quick perception of world conjuncture and change was an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Since this lesson has been very well absorbed, we have been the model country of this geography that has managed to maintain its unity, integrity, stability in peace from World War I to date.
A different approach is that in order for us to get through the global change process safely and safely, we have to leave the memorization behind and act in harmony with the facts.
In other words, there will be no good for anyone to carry their meaningless camping and feuds to this day that have caused our democracy to limp in the past.
Moreover, the smallest mistakes in today’s world lead to massive and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography is the Middle East we're in.

Turkish wind
Global giants, relying on Turkey's future, fought hard at the wind plant tender yesterday.
The world record was broken in the tender, which the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources has edited to ensure the transition to national energy by reducing external dependence.
The tender to lower Turkey's energy costs opened the way for $1 billion in investment and close to 4,000 jobs.
By the beginning of 2019, domestic production wind turbines will be included in the system.
Renewable resource areas (YEKA) opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources participated in the wind plant licensing tender, including eight consortiums of US, Chinese, German and Danish giants.
The tender first opened financial offer envelopes in an effort to identify the five lowest bidders.
Following the initial bid envelopes, the lowest offer was $4.19/kilovat hours.
The deficit reduction range was set at 0.01 cents.
After the tender began, Enercon decided not to participate in the open reduction of joint enterprise groups, which included Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas.
Groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed in the deficit reduction.
Following the withdrawal of the consortium where Nordex was also, MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon came to the last two.
MingYang-First Construction took 11 breaks.
The Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon Energy consortium never took a break.
Energy and Sure sources Minister Berat Colonelrak: Record day for Turkey.
The deficit reduction continued 30 laps.
The winner of the intense rivalry between the two consortiums was the Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon joint venture group, which made the lowest bid with a $3.48 cent/ kilowattate.
The consortium bids $3.49 cents/kilovat hours in the tender, while Deputy Undersecretary Alparslan withdrew his bid to 3.48 at the request of the tender commission headed by Bayraktar.
With the result of the two-hour YEKA tender, Turkey has achieved a world record.
$3.48/cent per kilowatt hour offered in the bid went into history as the world's lowest figure in this area.
The previous record was in Mexico's hands with $3.84/cent per kilowatt hour.
"When we look at Turkey and Germany in terms of 200 years of historical co-operation, I think this will contribute substantially to Turkey-German relations," said Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Colonelrak, who held a press conference following the end of the tender, stating that the German company Siemens won the contest was an important message to the region and the world.
We've got a big target.
Today's conclusion revealed how sound and confident the economy and energy market are in the future.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I am very proud to present with this tender that Turkey is in charge of the region and the most reliable investment-able countries in the world.
"In this picture, which we will be proud of as 80 million, the largest contribution is our President's, who, within his 15-year mandate and leadership, has brought Turkey to this point," he said.
Expressing that they had launched a new era with open, transparent and comparative competition, Colonelrak said: "One of the most important steps of this has occurred at a world record price of US$10.3/cent per kilowattate with a domestic contribution share in the wind until yesterday, with a historic record of $3.48/cent."
I'm proud of it, for my people, for my country.
Minister Colonelrak stated that they aim to activate the first domestic production panels in solar energy before the end of 2018, saying, "We will include our domestic production wind turbines in the system by the beginning of God 2019."
Turbines will be established in five designated areas.
The company that won the contest will service a total of 1,000 megawatts of installed power, with the requirement to establish at least 50 megawatts of wind power in each of these five regions.
The total investment of the Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon group will be over $1 billion.
With domestic wind plants entering the business, minimum energy of 3 billion kilowatts will be produced each year, and about 1.1 million homes will be needed annually by the wind.
An average of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2/year emissions will also be provided by wind facilities to be installed.
The company that won the contest will set up a factory with over $100 million in investments.
The factory will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines, at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will do RD work for 10 years in a total of 5 areas in at least three of its wing, generator design, materials technologies and production techniques, software and innovative gearbox areas.
The $5 million budget for RD studies is set for each year, with 50 technical staff of 80 per cent domestic engineers working.
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project has a licensing period of 30 years.
"We plan to fund the equipment from foreign sources and the rest from domestic banks," said Kazim Turker, chairman of the board of Turkishers Construction, who won the tender, stating that domestic production would be around 64 per cent in the project, with 35 per cent of equipment coming from abroad.
The tender reflects confidence in the Turkish economy, Turker said.
"It was a tender to reduce Turkey's external dependence by a thousand megawatts," said Murtaza Ata, head of Kalyon Holding Energy Group.
"We are pleased with the outcome," he said.
"We will do everything we can to lower the electricity unit cost," said Siemens Gamesa Turkey's Top Executive Hakan Yıldırım, adding that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years.
The rate of nativeity of wind turbines produced at the factory will be 65 percent.
Of the 8,000 industrial parts found in the wind turbine, 65 percent will be indigenous (at least 5,200 pieces).
At least 50 MW, a total of 1000 MW facilities will be established in each of the 5 regions.
3.750 employment opportunities 10 years of R&D obligation $5 million for R&D activities each year
1,000MW Wind Facility 65% Nativeity Rate Production of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines at least 2.3 MWe.
Over $1 billion in investment 400 MW/year wind turbine production capacity over $100 million in factory investment per year.
Electricity production to meet the needs of about 1.1 million homes annually is a minimum production of 3 billion kWh electrical power, an average of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2/year emissions reduction.
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists Revitalize Racist Lynch Event for Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury was passed through a group of viewers in rural Monroe Georgia, and marched to the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
The car, with four black passengers and a white driver, stepped forward to block the road of an armed group of white men before reaching the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a middle-aged man in a thin striped suit, took a long breath of his cigar and looked inside the windshield carefully.
Inside, the residents were startled by fear.
"We want that son of a bitch, Roger!" he barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged out of the front passenger seat, screaming through the darkness.
Fortunately, this horrific scene on June 22nd is just a reenactment.
But when a noose was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the audience breathed quite realistically.
Since 2005, human rights advocates have returned to the Ford bridge at Moore to revive the lynchings of the two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one's been charged with murder.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revival, said, "It doesn't make sense that even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are, not one person has been arrested all these years."
"It's a stain in history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks became a former Georgia state congressman and lifelong human rights advocate at the age of 71.
For him, this revival is a call for dramatic action and an annual reminder to Monroe society that injustice has never been corrected.
He said, "We want prosecution, we want results, we want wounds wrapped up, we want compromise, but we have to get justice first."
"We can't have the healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
On July 27, 1946, the coroner puts a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Ford linci in Moore.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, Monroe and more than 50 men from surrounding areas were suspects in the lynching.
But not one of them has ever been investigated.
Although suspects remain fugitives for decades, human rights advocates say the twin motivations of lynchings are always well known all over the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a high court ruling had made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote in the primary for the first time at the end of that summer.
According to the FBI, almost the same time as the election, black partner Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in connection with a woman, apparently during a fight.
Brooks testified that the rumor in the town was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not her own husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a leading white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcom out of jail.
Dorothy and her cousins, Mae Murray, went to jail with George Dorsey.
But as they drove away from the prison, when they arrived at the Ford Bridge in Moore, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes, "It turns out Harrison was the one who ordered the murders."
"There was also apparently a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement, which not only took part in the murder, but destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses."
Brooks told me shorter and concise.
He said: "It was a suffrage massacre".
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this society: 'This is what will happen to you if you register and vote.'"
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has been directing a revival of the Ford Bridge lynchings at Moore, which takes place every year.
His performance reveals all the details, remarkable and based on a deep kind of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to translate, but Greene says that's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about the lynching because it confronts all of us with the ugliness inside us."
"But if you're not listening to me or listening to what's happening to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
Rehearsals of this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) crowded into a room, and when Greene willingly entered the well-rehearsed general lines of the game, they listened.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
Over the years, he played the role of President Klansman, but says the role never gets easier.
Marbaugh said, "I feel dirty because it's not me."
"But I think it's very important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room, were rehearsing their lines.
The game begins as Malcom yells at Hester, who he is furious with for sleeping with his wife Dorothy, pushing him away.
"Z... I said, get off my property!"
Rascona's responding.
There's a bang.
And then everyone (at least black actors) laughs.
Greene's laughing the most.
Rascona asked, "What?!"
He was agitated, he was surprised.
Was I too hard?
Greene said "no" in the giggles.
"I just don't think white people said shit back then."
One of the black players threw a rock mixed with a joke by saying "Yes".
"You have to suppress 'R'."
So the energy in the room changes, and some kind of intimacy replaces the unrest.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not just for the sake of the game, but also for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene is starting again.
This time, Rascona says the word N, sharp and emphatic.
Absolutely no one's laughing.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
There's screaming, gunfire, and then silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black stands on the bodies of actors and reads Billie Holiday's sad eulogy, "The Strange Fruit".
In one of the two words, his voice breaks.
An average group of four dozen people back a hundred yards wiping sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided, black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the performance, many of them from up the road.
While Brooks took them on a holy journey to the Malcoms and Dorseys' cemeteries, they all endured Georgia's oppressive moisture for almost eight hours.
Until this point, the killings had remained an anecdote, but standing in the same place where the heat is now means the air feels cursed.
As the final notes of the song weaken, Greene invites the crowd to zoom in and examine the bodies.
The children squat on their hands, grasping false blood and still bodies and whispering to each other.
A little boy mumbles like he reminds himself, "They're not really dead."
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the crowd and it's over.
Actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh in a suit playing President Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow actors and tears in their arms, the emotional cost of performance finally comes to him.
A woman whispers, "It's okay."
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did it for a reason."
Then the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At a table, the white couple from Atlanta are fervently chatting about a revival with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski is having trouble finding words about how performance makes her feel.
He said, "Listening to these horrible, awful words and those behaviors... come from people who look like you and they do it because they look like you."
"What this has done to me is make me think the lynchings are still going on," he added, "it's now just called police shootings."
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks is the center of attention as he eats at his desk and tells his human rights memoirs.
He said he's already planning next year's performance.
He said, "Resurrection is kind of inspiring because it describes what we're going through, but it's also instructive."
"It's like if you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not investigate their own past and do not know their own past are doomed to repeat it."
Accident in Muğla: 4 dead; 6 injured
According to the report, the car with 48 YS 411 plates under the direction of Adam Çatm collided with the car with the number 09 B 1510 in Sinan Rural.
Several health and rescue teams were dispatched to the scene on a call to 112 Emergency Call Center.
In the accident, Derya Kıroğlan and Yasemin Çıtın, who were found to be eight months pregnant with Duraniye Kıroğlan, were killed at the scene and Mertcan Çoğan State Hospital where he was removed.
Sinan, Senem, Furkan Kıroğlan and Adem, Yılmaz and Abdullah Yüğit Çığtığla Sıtkı Koçman University have been taken to Yüçlenen Hospital.
It has been learned that the lives of the injured are still at stake.
Due to the accident, the Bedan-Kavakadere highway was closed for some time.
Kağakadere Mayor Mehmet Demir and Yagan Gendarmerie Commander Captain Engin arrived at the scene in January and received information about the accident.
EC Party-to-Congressional website
By the AK Party, 6.
The website with an "akongress.com" address was established for the usual Congressional process.
The website featured pamphlets, material and visuals that the party agency would use in the process.
In the site's 'Communication strategy' section, rules that must be followed in the congressional process were ranked in 14 titles.
President and EC Party President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose message was posted on the website, warned members of the agency to comply with the party's institutional identity during the congressional process.
"Now we begin a new era of breakthrough," Erdogan said in his message.
2023 To achieve their goal with more firm steps, we must be renewed and refreshed.
He used the phrases, "We must continue to work hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder tomorrow as we did yesterday."
Pearson made another 3,000 layoffs to revitalize the business, cut the dividend
British training group Pearson said he would start another restructuring programme to overcome the pressures the business faces, while on Friday he would make another 3,000 layoffs and reduce the intermediate profit share by 72 per cent.
The layoffs, mostly late 2018 and early 2019, will be added to 4,000 positions lost in previous reconstruction, said chief executive John Fallon.
In May, Pearson announced a plan that would save another £300 million ($394 million) by trying to resuscitate the sliding business quickly to digital learning with a third cost reduction program.
The firm agreed to sell its share of the Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, saying there was no change in this year's perspective after reporting its basic sales by £2.05 billion with an increase of 1 per cent in the first half.
Text 2 has led to death again!
According to the coroner's initial report, Hakan's death was suicide, according to preliminary findings in his preliminary autopsy report.
The detailed examination showed no signs of battery or algebra on the child's body.
The reason for his suicide is that he was gasping for air as a result of the elastic bandage around his neck.
The gland his parents referred to as a bandage was also identified as the elastic bandage used in the injuries.
According to daily Habertürk’s report Müslim Sarıyar, it has been learned that after the detailed report on the death of the child was prepared, the report stating that the incident was suicide will be sent to the Grandmec Public Prosecutor’s Office which is conducting the investigation.
Police are investigating the child's suicide in full detail, while further examinations of his confiscated computer continue after the incident.
The police said they would also appeal to Hakan's friends' testimony.
It is also said that information from Hakan's computer, which his relatives say is "cleaned", can be accessed to third persons or a gang.
Police are assessing that a gang may have led Hakan to suicide.
The fact that Hakan committed suicide turned his eyes into violent Text2.
Reacting on the grounds that it causes addiction and violence in children, it was raised by the murder of 13-year-old "minic hacker" Metin Kang" in Text2, 2009, which was banned by the Governorate of Antalya last year to those under the age of 15.
To play Text2 designed in Korea in 2005, you have to enter its website and register as a member.
Players seek peace and justice in the world with the dragon god in the game.
There are wars in doing this, and the dose of violence is increasing.
The game also features images of war with sharp, piercing weapons such as lines, swords, machetes, axes, as well as images of people being torn apart by wild animals to defeat their flesh.
The player buys characters with money to get stronger.
Following the incident on July 25 at the Esenyurt Istiklal neighborhood house on Körnar Street, the family who buried their children the following day continued their murder claim.
"The whole dream was to be a doctor, we don't think he could hurt himself or anyone else because of the game," said Mehmet Ekinci, the father. "They wrapped the elastic bandage around his neck and tied a knot on the side."
That's how it was found, son.
We certainly don't think that our son can hurt himself or anyone else because of an online game or commit suicide.
We knew you were playing a game like this.
It wasn't a game he was playing.
Let's just say that when he got a little bored, he let it go.
Anne Gülizar Ekinci said, "No one has entered or exited the building."
My child is said to have entered the house at a certain hour.
None of them match.
When her brother came home, there was only one chair.
"But when his funeral was found, there were two chairs next to the computer," he said.
PRIVATE WARRIOR: Could be gang-related.
Families don't generally pay attention to this.
They're looking at me like, "Whatever's going on with my kid in the house."
Through the games, the child communicates with many people.
There may have been a loan situation there, or there may have been blasphemy.
Or he invited a person in the game to the house, there might have been some trouble between them.
He may have been affected by his problems with other people, not directly from the game, but from whom he communicated over the game.
The boy may have thought the visuality of the game, the fiction of it, was real.
The trauma that led to the suicide could be related to blackmail.
If the child is facing a complaint against the family, there is also a depression because he cannot solve it.
He couldn't have committed suicide because of the game himself.
There's also the possibility that the boy might be involved in the gang.
He could be involved with the gang.
Individually, it can't be anything that the child could have done alone.
I.T. systems consultant Fusun NEBIL: Families need to know the interaction of their children
We can't say the games are harmful.
Research also says that games are useful for the development of children.
What matters here is that parents pay attention to what their children play and how they talk to actors online.
Parents need to know what content they're attracted to and take precautions.
There are only two children in Turkey in five years who are said to have died of play.
Which means that ending a child's life isn't just the effect of games.
I wonder what drove this boy to do that.
We have to find out first.
You need to look at the sociology and psychology around the kid.
Stock market revenue in Istanbul amounted to 50 per cent
The BIST 100 index continued its trend of ascent, which it began in December 2016, and moved its rise to the 8th month at the top.
Thus, the index gained 45.3 per cent during this period, as it recorded an eight-month rise in a row for the first time since July 2007.
With his performance since the beginning of the year, the BIST 100 index left behind the world's main stock exchanges, including Germany, the United States, Britain, Japan, and did not leave the lead in July, as well as in return.
The Dow Jones index in the United States, 0.81 percent, followed by the FTSE 100 index in the UK, with an increase of 2.54 percent, completing the July month to 7.06 percent rise.
With the DAX index in Almaya, the Nikkei index in Japan finished July with a loss of value.
As of the January–July period, the BIST 100 index was seen performing high from both the main world stock exchanges and the emerging country stock market indexes.
This year's 2016 closure followed the BIST 100 index, which gained 37.6 per cent, the Dow Jones index with a 10.76 per cent increase, the DAX index with 5.55 per cent value gain, the Nikkei index with a 4.55 per cent rise, and the FTSE 100 index with a 3.21 per cent increase.
The MSCI EM index, an indicator of developing country stock markets, has yielded 23 per cent.
Based on the historical process of the BIST 100 index, it has shown similar performances in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which last completed 8 consecutive months between December 2006 and July 2007, had recorded a 38.3 percent increase during this period.
In addition, the BIST 100 index had completed the 8 months between August 1996 and March 1997, gaining consecutive value in 9 months between May 1997 and January 1998.
The BIST 100 index has continued to rise for eight months, Meksa Investment Research Director Eren Can Ummüt told AA correspondent, noting that the rise has exceeded 37 per cent since the beginning of the year.
The hope noted that the MSCI developmental markets (EM) index recorded 23 per cent rise, with positive disintegration just looking at these rates:
Fund flow to developing countries has been going on since the beginning of the year.
In particular, funds in search of high income prefer countries that pay higher interest.
In this case, domestic markets are affected in a positive way.
Of course, he has an appetite for taking risks on a global scale.
The stock indexes, which are in risky asset status, are in demand.
In the United States, the S&P 500 index has been testing new record levels almost every week, in parallel with its record increasing by nearly 11 per cent since New Year's Eve.
At the beginning of the year, U.S. Central Baka (Fed) emphasized that 3 interest increases stresses estimated markets but that the Fed has eliminated uncertainty using verbal guidance policy quite well, Umüt noted that there is an insensitive market to Fed's interest increase.
Hope has expressed that inflation in the United States is not yet at the desired level, and that the Fed's expectations that it will not act rashly on interest increase and avoid radical moves are quite effective in existing pricing.
U.S. President Donald Trump's failure to cancel health reform, known as "Obamacare", has strengthened his perception that expanding fiscal policies cannot fulfill his promises, "Although the US economy expectations growing faster thanks to Trump have a positive effect on stock markets at one time, the failure of promises strengthens the Fed's and the market's hand in terms of the response to faster growth and faster inflation."
Noting that 2016 is a year of many negatives in terms of Turkey's markets, the BIST 100 index, which is negatively separated and oversold, is in an effort to close the gap, according to similar ones.
Noting that they did not see a strong recovery with domestically sourced news flow, Umüt noted that the current appearance could be interpreted more as an increase in risk risk taking abroad, triggering the desire to close the gap compared to those similar to domestic markets.
The hope noted that it watched a number of snow sales in the BIST 100 index, which technically tested new records with levels of 108,600:
In particular, its 109,500-110,000 regions are a critical threshold in the short term.
It's normal for snow sales to happen after it gets close to these levels.
In the short term, we think that there should be a new local or global story for pricing over 110,000.
For now, 107,500 of its support could trigger profit sales in the lower direction.
So even though we're following 107,000 intermediate supports, I think you can see the relaxation of up to 106,000-105,500.
In particular, the breaking of 105,500 support can bring a retreat to 104,300 levels, which corresponds to 50 percent Fibo of the rise from 100,000 to 108,600 levels.
Noting that both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) decisions would be at the focal point of the global market, Umüt said expectations for the Fed are already clear, but the possibility of increasing interest in September FOMC could trigger strengthening in the US dollar.
"What's really important is what the ECB will say," the hope said, stating that this could trigger profit sales in the developing country (GOU) stock indexes, which are under the shadow of overtaking in the short term.
After the July monetary policy board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said they would discuss the course of monetary policy in the fall, which allowed euro/dollar parity to rise above 1,1700 levels.
Thus, statements that the 60 billion-euro-per-month asset acquisition programme will be reduced or terminated on a global scale would mean that post-Fed liquidity will also be reduced by the ECB.
"So negative pricing may begin on behalf of the country's markets, which, like Turkey, give high-cost deficits and have to access foreign funds".
Erol Gurcan, Director of Gender Investment Advisory, also said there was a fairly serious rally in terms of global stock markets following Trump's election as president in the United States in November 2016.
Gurcan noted that it is possible to say that the key element that triggers this rally movement is promoting expectations of global growth, particularly Trump's commitments to tax reduction:
The stock market Istanbul was also the head of prominent stock markets in the global rally.
One of the most important reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained highly discounted in recent years compared to similar emerging country markets, but it is also good to say that steps by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have played a serious role.
Specifically, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which became active in March, has had a serious impact on the rising that has so far been observed in the index.
For the rest of the year, Gürcan reported that positive developments were significantly reflected in pricing and that KGF, which also had a significant role in this rise, has gradually achieved satisfaction, expressed that the BIST 100 index is still being discounted compared to similar country markets, but the search for a new story for the remainder of the year could also gradually come to the forefront.
The 180-day action plan, particularly expected to share its details for some time, noted that improvements such as promoting company profits such as increasing the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, could contribute positively in this sense, such as possible tax reduction raised in the near term.
The fact that key developed country central banks such as Georgia, Fed, ECB and the Central Bank of England (BoE) will gradually tighten existing expanding monetary policy stances has also been among the critical risk factors for developing countries, stressing that "The Fed, which has been continuing to moderate interest increases for some time, will likely launch the balance sheet reduction process after September, the ECB is likely to end its asset acquisition programme in the near term, and the BOE is likely to be in the main sense that there will be significant developments from the country's developmental assessment, which will increase interest following the Fed."
In possible correction movements in the index in the upcoming period, Georgia said the 104,150-104,600 support areas, corresponding to the 200-hour moving average since the beginning of the year, could continue to level 101,700, 100,000, 99,200 respectively if this support zone was broken.
In the event of maintaining the current trend of ascent and breaking 108,605 resistance, the current historic peak level, the index could rise to 110,000 to 12,000,000, he said.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
According to officials, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, the Afghan capital, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
Local sources that have not been confirmed say three civilians died in the incident in the city's Karabakh region.
The bombing was the last violence in Afghanistan this month; more than 30 people died Tuesday in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said Thursday's explosion attacked the Afghan military on a joint patrol mission with a 'personnel-driven handmade explosive'.
The statement said that all the injured were in good condition and were under treatment at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram air base.
Reporters say the growing force of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh are a major concern for NATO forces, stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan witnessed the deaths of at least 1662 civilians in the first half of 2017, with an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, in Kabul's predominantly Shia region, a suicide bomb car killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people in the country's deadliest militant attack after US-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The act of violence stresses the unstable security situation in Afghanistan as US president Donald Trump puts his weight on whether to increase the number of U.S. troops assisting the military and police in the country.
Reporters say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have caused a crisis in public confidence in the government, its policies, and especially President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
EPA has stopped delaying the dirty air rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Organization returned one day after the decision to delay the law, which demanded that states block emissions that caused the foul smoke, an Obama era law, when 15 states sued the organization on this initiative.
The EPA announced its decision late Wednesday that the organisation would continue with the "2015 Ozon Decisions", saying it showed determination to work with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and being sensitive to them," EPA president Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced his intention to delay the EPA's ozone decisions by one year by October 2018; with these decisions, the current dirty smoke pollution is measured in various parts of the country, and it is decided where to cut is mandatory to meet tougher air quality standards.
15 states, mostly Democrats, and the District of Columbia had filed a lawsuit Tuesday that said the effort was illegal.
The President Donald Trump administration continues its quest to recover wide range of environmental regulations implemented by former president Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda Trump called reviving economic growth.
But these efforts led to the reaction of the Democrats and the conservationist groups who were concerned about the impact of more emissions on public health.
EPA's website says that air inhalation containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma".
The forest gave the good news...
It's time for the stopper and wing transfer!
Beşiktaş President Fikret has made statements to Bein Sports on the transfer of Orman, Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and stopper.
Fikret Forest said...
There's no surprise in the transfer.
The goal is not too much transfer, it's a dot shot.
Now we're going to do a stopper and a wing transfer.
We've got Champions League games, so I hope we get a good draw.
We have to transfer wings.
10 million euros is easy, but we don't have that budget.
If it comes to what we call budgets, we transfer it, and if we don't, we don't die.
There's no way I can tell until I'm clear on the lens.
We're a public company.
The end of patience is peace.
The ISIS threat is only for August 30th, is it not for the festival?
Reactions continue in Ankara Governorate banning all mass events including sit-ins, memorial meetings and such throughout August, including concerts on the grounds of "ISIS threat".
The governorship's ban has stated "all mass events", while the 7th in Ankara.
The International Festival of Great Ankara continues.
CHP Group Vice President and Ankara MP Levent Gök told the SÖZCU that "August 30th cannot be even affected by the bans" and said:
He's got some serious confusion.
Even the governor's office is having second thoughts about what decision he's going to make...
The government's mission is to create areas where holidays will be celebrated.
CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir said, "All Ankara has a security problem, only Gökçek's organizations do not have a security problem".
Ankara Independent MP Aylin Nazlıaka moved the ban to parliament.
"Doesn't this ban make clear the AKP's hostility to the republic and Atatürk, and how do you intend to prevent millions from celebrating August 30th in the fields?" said Nazlıaka, who filed a motion by asking the Prime Minister to respond.
"I learned from Edwina myself that I was deceived"
Demet Şener, who continued his divorce case with Ibrahim Kutluay, was in the Orderstone with his lawyer Asli Hatemi the previous day.
Shener, who filed a lawsuit against Edwina Sponza, whom he claimed to have destroyed her home, had presented photographs of Sponza and Kutluay as evidence to the court.
"Demet has obtained my private photographs illegally," said the societal beautiful Sponza, filing a criminal complaint against Şener.
'I DIDN'T KNOW.'
Following this recent development, Şener, who met with his lawyer at the Nispilestone Delicatessen, left the venue when he saw the journalists.
Sener, who was very cheerful, laughed when Edwina Sponza's claim about the photographs was reminded, saying, "God, I must have gone into her house and taken it."
"There is such a complaint but its contents are not true."
"We have everything; we presented it to the court," he said.
Şener said reporters "everyone knew about your husband's relationship with Sponza recently."
He was shocked by the question, "How did you not know?"
What?
How?
"I swear to God I didn't know," said Sener, "Was I going to believe my husband who looked me in the eye or the rumor of the people?"
"Didn't I hear it, of course I heard it the first time," said Sener, who first said after reporters insisted, "Did you not hear it?"
But in no way did I believe in such a thing.
Everything was normal, it was in place; I had nothing to suspect.
Ma'am, when I put everything in my hand, I found out all about it, so...
Answering the question, "Was it Sponza who sent the evidence?", Shener became confused by claiming that Sponza himself had sent the photographs and correspondence he presented to the court.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay was montage.
Beşiktaş will sign Negredo tomorrow
The Beşiktaş Club will officially include Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo tomorrow.
The signing ceremony will be held at Vodafone Park for Negredo, where Beşiktaş agreed in principle on his transfer to the Valencia Club of Spain.
The signing ceremony, which will be attended by club president Fikret Orman, will be held at 12:00 p.m.
By the way, the Spanish football player will also have a health check tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar Economy and Trade Minister Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani said they wanted to express their gratitude to the people of Turkey.
Al Thani: "Thank you very much for your honourable attitude and your support for us."
My brother, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, I also convey the greetings of the Order of Qatar.
The Qatari economy has proven its resistance.
In many countries, economies have been affected negatively, while our economy remains intact.
For Qatar to be independent and strong, we must work with all our might.
We have broken the embargo against us in many hours thanks to Turkey.
We don't lack anything right now.
Our natural resources, gas exports, are giving Qatar's economy a huge boost.
We were not affected by Turkey's relentless blockade against the law.
Today Qatar continues its worldwide production of gas and LNG.
"We have experienced a 30 per cent increase, not a decline in our gas exports following what has happened," he said.
"There has been a volume of $554 million in the first quarter of trade between us," Al Thani said, with brotherly relations between Qatar and Turkey in all areas.
Recent decisions have also played an important role in this.
As a result of proving itself in the Qatar market, it is very important for us to accelerate the entry of goods from Turkey in all sectors, to invest in many areas.
"I thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us," he said.
The cost of recent disasters is $300 million
TSB President Can Akın Çağlar noted that seven thousand damages were reported to insurance companies following the July 18th flood, an 800-million-dollar damage was reported in the Gökova earthquake on July 21st, and on July 27th, there were 22 thousand reported damages in the flood and hail in Istanbul, adding that the cost of the last three incidents to insurance had been $300 million.
"In terms of insurance, the damage caused by the fill-up, the hull damage per vehicle was 3,500 lira, and the glass damage was around $1,000."
"In the depression, the average housing damage is $6,000," he said.
Emphasizing their intensive efforts as a sector to compensate for economic losses, Can Akın Ages stated that 3 out of 4 people have no housing insurance, one out of 2 businesses have no fire insurance, and 2 out of 3 out of 3 have no insurance insurance, saying: "The risk of natural disaster increases due to climate change."
Due to the low-insurance rate in our country, the risk of facing serious damage costs to our citizens and institutions is growing every day.
All of these costs must not be left on the government.
Insurance policies are not as expensive as they think, insurance is not just a sector that pays damages; it is also a risk management consultant.
It's very important for our people and our country to increase insurance awareness and insurance rates.
"In the overall conditions of cosco insurance, it says that the insurers should report their damage within five business days, and that time ended yesterday."
"Is he going to be a victim of insurance?" he answered, "Although in general, the statute of commerce has a statute of limitations of 2 years."
"It's also a natural disaster, so insurance people don't have to panic, no company says they don't pay," he said.
That's how the German media saw the huge bid!
Turkey's first Wind Energy Renewable Energy Resources (YEKA) tender was noted by the German company Siemens during a period of growing difficulties between Turkey and Germany.
"German Siemens won the huge tender in Turkey", the German media announced.
"The consortium will invest over $1 billion in wind facilities," DWelle Turkish reported in reporting that the YEKA tender was won by the Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon consortium.
"The tender for the creation of a thousand megawatt wind energy capacity is Turkey's first YEKA tender", the report said that the number of firms competing in the tender today fell from 8 to 2, facing Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortiums, and the Chinese Mingyang consortium withdrew from the tender as the 30th round began.
After the tender, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Colonelrak made striking statements on Turkey-German relations.
The bid resulted in the German company Siemens winning, and we can say that this picture is an important message to the region and to the world.
Looking at Turkey and Germany's 200-year historical co-operation, I think this will contribute significantly to Turkey-German relations.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I am very proud to present with this tender that Turkey is the head of the region and the world's most reliable investment-able countries.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, meeting a possible competition.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who would cross paths to showcase their most satisfying boxing match in the near future for £147 six, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia was in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until he walked down the aisle and greeted the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
On Saturday at Showtime, unanimously, after Garcia defeated former world champion Adrien Broner on four bikes, both fighters are among the top five members of the unsupervised list.
Garcia reached out her right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7pm Saturday night.
While the two posed for photographs, Lomochenko's manager, Egis Klimar, recorded that a potential competition between fighters would be "excellently large".
Garcia gave me the "I'm an old feather dick" reminder.
"I went up to the top (140 pounds) for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm little for 140.
I want to land on a light ball.
He'll have to go to light ball, too, so we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this."
Lomachenko joined.
"Shit needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be in 'pay and watch'; setting a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer and having Lomachenko fight in an opening match of £135 this year is part of his strategy; Garcia is also interested in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell encounter for his lightweight title at the Forum on September 23.
"The fight could be in 'pay and watch' because all fans want it," Garcia said, and later expressed that it was open to whichever channel offered the best financial package.
We're the real names.
No other name creates that kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "major fighter" and could attend his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko hesitated to give Garcia plenty of credit and said he thought the threeweight champions from Riverside looked "too slow", "sorry, Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was to show the power of fists and then boxing.
Both said they felt that momentum was created for their own encounter.
"This is a fight that needs to be fought.
Another fight doesn't create so much attention and gossip.
"I'm very happy dealing with this," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've waited for the best fighters, and he's Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Turkish resti from Russia to America
The White House is not considering implementing sanctions that will affect Moscow's pipeline constructions, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of these lines.
And that's because the cost of borrowing has increased.
Concerned by Western investment partners considering withdrawing from projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin in turn accelerated construction of pipelines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which built the Turkish Stream line, which was scheduled to reach Turkey under the Black Sea, accelerated construction at the request of Gazprom.
Reuters also wrote that Gazprom had begun construction of a second pipeline parallel to the "quickly" Turkish Stream in order to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment test announced
The latest results of evaluation tests by refugees subject to a new medical age assessment method in Sweden ruled that more than 80 per cent of those who participated in the test were over 18 years old, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden's national Office of Forensic Medicine and Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the age assessment more accurate in the asylum process after the Swedish Immigration Agency's (Migrationssverket) criticism of some refugees' failures in assessing their right age.
To date, Migrationsverket sent 6880 cases for testing, and the Office of Forensic Medicine and Medicine has announced the result of a total of 2481 from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
80 percent (2002 men) were ruled to be 18 or over, while in 25 cases the Forensics and Drug Administration ruled that the subject was "possibly 18 and above."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "possibly under 18".
The tests were conducted only in cases where one's age was suspicious.
According to Johan Göransson of Forensics and Medicine, the results are consistent with past months.
"We don't see much difference in statistics according to past months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The proportion of cases ruled to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees lie about their age.
In May, the apartment 581 announced the result of the test and said that there were 442 situations in which "those who were examined were shown to be 18 years of age or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of the 581 cases announced, she found that 243 cases clearly declared 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which involves x-raying 20-year-old teeth and doing an MRI scan of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyze them, is criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, who assesses the biological maturity of people who also have work on whether the age of puberty was entered sooner or later.
"I have reasons to think about this, and I don't think this is the kind of measurement that is used.
It's very suspicious to decide this way about biological life.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic and Drug Administration argued that the tests were correct: "In general, you might say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is small.
The biggest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, in which case the risk is around 10 percent."
The Star Memorial Mosque opens for worship today
In 1885, the Star Memorial Mosque, commissioned by Abdulhamit to architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be inaugurated today with Friday prayer following the restoration work.
Regional Director Mürsel Sarı said the restoration work, which began in June 2013, was completed and the mosque was prepared for opening.
Yellow gave the following information: "Restoration work was conducted in 2 coverage."
The first part was the repair of the mosque, the main building.
The second part was environmental regulation.
About $16 million was spent on the first part and around $11 million for environmental regulation.
First, the bullets of the wooden dome were opened, after they were renovated, the outer walls, the dirt of external factors, were cleared of rust.
There have been drainages on the resuscitation.
When we get inside the mosque, there are some very rich decorations, as you can see.
It's a work of star motifs, and it's very rich in pencil work.
There's a mixed style here.
"The traces of snails are also visible, given that they were made in the Ottomans and 1885s, baroque style has also become a factor in architecture."
U.S.U.L.HAMIT'S ELECTION
"The chandelier in the middle of the mosque is the German Emperor 2."
He had partial malfunctions, refurbished and hung in place.
It's a really valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages on both sides of the mosque that are symmetrical, called salutaries.
We know this was done by our great Khan, Abdulhamit Khan, who built the mosque himself.
So we have information that he did these things with his own hands and was installed here.
They're still standing here in their original form.
Sarı said that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to attend the opening ceremony of the mosque.
Pantic claim in Göttepe
The Ukrainian press said that the 25-year-old Serbian footballer who failed to qualify in Dinoma Kiev could be hired to the club in yellow red.
Pantic, who started football for Serbia's Red Star team, played for Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed for Dinamo Kiev at halftime last season.
West Virginia governor announces he's changing party
Jim Justice, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, announced Thursday evening that he would change his party at a rally with President Trump.
"Like it or not, Democrats have left me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts... I will tell you today as West Virginians, I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor."
The rally was flooded with cheering.
"So tomorrow I will change my record as a Republican," Justice added.
"If I were technical director, I'd tell you it's time to start a different game."
Mr. Trump had previously promised to make an important announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump had won West Virginia by 42 points and Democratic candidate Justice had not supported Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, had been elected in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes notes that he owned coal mines in five states, with coal work inherited from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Congress released a statement Thursday evening saying that "Governor Justice's change of party was another blow to the Democratic Party, which preferred to work to stop him rather than make our country big again."
"With only 15 governorships in history and the control of at least a few state legislatures, Governor Justice's announcement is only the latest rejection of a party that is head-to-head without leadership and cannot find a positive, unifying message," RNC women spokesman Ronna McDaniel told CBS.
I'll do what's best for Turkey
Olympic third, Turkish record holder.
He was born in Cuba, but made Turkey his home country where he came for the F. Garden...
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and played in the national jersey...
First he became European champion, then the Olympic third...
Now it's one of Turkey's most important medal hopes at the World Championships in Athletics.
Yasmani Capello, who competed in the 400m hurdles, spoke to SABAH before the championship, which will begin today.
When they were young, they didn't want you because they didn't like your grades in Cuba.
You hired a coach and improved yourself.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
Some people think you chose Turkey for the money.
What are you talking about?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was leaving the national team.
From that moment on, I've drawn a line on what I've been through, what I've been through.
Then I came to Turkey at the invitation of the Fenerbahçe club.
My attempt at the National Team was thanks to Fenerbahçe.
They made me an offer for reinforcements.
I started a new chapter with Turkey.
I have suffered many injuries in my youth, but I have achieved significant success in Rio and Amsterdam after the opportunities offered to me in Turkey.
I can't wait to do my best at the World Athletics Championships and win a different title.
You cried at a press conference recently.
Can you tell us why?
Every time a question is raised about Turkey taking care of me, I can think of my childhood, being kicked out of the Cuban National Team at the age of 23.
And of course in Turkey, people approach me.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt similar things when the Istiklal March was stolen.
I couldn't hold my tears.
And thank Turkey for giving me the opportunity to make my dreams come true.
I'm very happy to belong to the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said you might have a Turkish girlfriend.
You're with a Turk now, you went to Cuba together.
Do you want to share what you've been through?
The biggest plus of being with a Turk is calm...
When I compare it to Cuban women, peace...
Turkish girls are taking care of their relationship.
Your girlfriend is also your assistant coach.
You're together all day, for example, does it interfere with your diet?
He eats more sweets than I do.
(Both laughing) Actually, I don't have a very strict diet, but from time to time, it interferes with what I eat.
My trainer, Massimo Matrone, has often given me strict warnings on my diet, but I know it's for my own good.
How are you with Turkish food, does your boyfriend cook for you?
Turkish women cook so well, but my boyfriend makes it so much better.
(laughs) Bean-pilav is my first choice.
I just laughed at him.
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He'd replaced me with other young people.
We met in Cuba after winning medals for Turkey.
He looked me in the face and showed me to the young athletes next to him and said, "Look, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.
♪ I'm my eyes, I'm my nerves ♪
Your glasses at the races are the subject of curiosity...
I'm just using it for concentration.
The moment I put the glasses on, I cut off my relationship with the world and put up walls on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line, and I don't see anything else.
What do you think of the first time we say Tokyo 2020 for TOKYO?
Felix Sanchez...
He won the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics when he was 35 years old in the 400 metres hurdles.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at 33.
TURKCELL GIVES YOU A TEST
"We sincerely believe that Yasmani Capello will succeed in this championship as well as will best represent our flag," said Turkishcell Deputy Director-General Ismail All.
We wish every athlete in London good luck.
"We will continue our support for further development of Turkish athletics and greater achievements for our country," he said.
Coe praises Russia's 'samimi' apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the boss of global athletics, praised Russia's sincere apology for the doping scandal, but stressed that the time was not right for the country to be re-admitted to the sport.
Russia's athletic boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's ban from sports was right and he was determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized to "all athletes whose gold and silver medals were forcibly taken from them in the competition".
Despite his assessments, the IAAF Congress voted that the ban would continue after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia in November 2015.
"I think today is a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and the entire convention were pleased... that the Russian Federation had accepted it, that it had survived very turbulent days, and that it had done everything possible to restore the federation..."
Coe also said that Russia is "pleasant" that it accepts its re-acceptance criteria.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think it's been put on the road, but Congress supports the suggestion that the task force is not the right time for Russia's rights to be returned," Coe said.
"We must do everything to normalize this situation over the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been to want to separate clean athletes from the flawed system," added the director.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting solid IAAF criteria, will be competing neutrally at the World Athletics Championships, which will begin Friday in London.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met many criteria for reinstatement of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that the drug test was still insufficient and that banned trainers still work freely.
Don't deny 'tank' news from the United States to 'YPG'
The US Embassy in Ankara has announced that no tanks have been given to any side fighting in Syria.
Claims have been denied that hundreds of trucks were sent to the YPG loaded with tanks and weapons.
The embassy said in a statement titled, "A statement about false news in the press about trucks going to Syria".
In a series of reports in the press in the past few days, it has been falsely claimed that the United States has sent hundreds of trucks loaded with tanks and guns to Syria to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some fundamental facts about the current situation in Syria.
The United States has not given tanks to any group fighting Deasha in Syria.
Much of the United States' military assistance primarily consisting of light weapons and ammunition supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
Syrian Arabs, including SAK, are fighting to clear Deaşı from the region and get their homes back.
TYDTA President Ermut: Direct foreign investment will be above last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said that 55 per cent of all investments from last year came after July.
"Maybe there was going to be more increase, but there was a bet," he said, adding that there was no reduction in investments due to the July 15 FETÖ coup attempt.
Maybe if these conditions didn't happen, if there weren't some regional improvements, we could see a greater increase in the impact.
That's why we have more hope for next year.
Hopefully, it'll be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
As of the first five months, we're already going 11 percent higher than last year's first five months.
But we don't find that enough.
"We hope there will be more".
"It's not that it doesn't make us worry whether it's global or regional developments," Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut recalled that 75 per cent of direct investments normally come from Europe by 2010, adding:
That number has dropped to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share increased from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do that, the Gulf countries had some problems with themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them; especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar are two important actors.
But the problem between these two countries upsets us and, in its case, allows investors to delay their decision a little longer.
Not only in terms of investments in Turkey, we may be experiencing some delays.
Arda Ermut reminded me that there were some incidents in Germany last week, but that the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had a clear and precise reaction to the situation.
When they spoke to investors of countries where the harshest political crisis occurred, President Erdogan's reaction said, "Look, problems are between governments, certainly not among the people."
Second of all, these people came and invested in my country.
These are no different from Turkish companies to us.
On the contrary, if they have any problems, they'll come to us, and we'll figure it out.
"We are certainly not going to let them be victims," Ermut said, adding that they continue to support all investors with the comfort of it.
"We can reassure that in the next period," Ermut said.
You'll see that neither German companies nor investors from countries where we have some political problems will have any trouble.
On the contrary, hopefully we will do our best to increase investments from these countries.
We think the investments from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions of the investment environment.
"But we will do our part at this point and we will do our best with the goal of not affecting our investors' perception of the investment environment".
TYDTA President Ermut explained that after a one-generation one-way strategy, Turkey has taken great interest in China, but if problems in the Gulf are resolved, they expect the biggest investment from the Gulf.
"In relations with Germany, there is not one investor who says, 'We had trouble with these relationships, we had investments because of this incident, we're running away'". Ermut, who used his statements, noted that there were companies coming, coming and following.
"Almost 10 per cent of the projects currently in our portfolio are for German companies."
So almost 10% of the companies we've interviewed from all over the world are made up of German companies.
Some of these are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
He's gonna expand his investment, or he's got a subject, and we're open as a project.
"So German companies are actually still a significant part of our daily workflow," he said.
Emphasizing that all state institutions should be careful during periods of perception operations to Turkey, Ermut said the issue is sensitive and could be affected in the slightest bad communication.
Ermut explained that what happened in the past two or three weeks was a good lesson, saying:
Investors and politicians always have different agendas.
We've always seen that economic relationships always make political developments sort of sit on the road.
Germany will remain an important business partner and an important investor.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
The election agenda in Germany, unfortunately, increases such rhetoric.
I think it's going to be a little bit better once they're gone.
In Saudi Arabia's special, the two countries are also careful not to make negative statements.
After all, an investor investing in Turkey is investing in all environmental markets.
So, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region, there have been processes that have slowed down a little.
But we're still negotiating with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors are holding off on a decision that they may be able to make faster.
'I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia in a negative sense, I'm getting out of here' we don't have a Saudi investor.
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who are still living in Turkey, who are here on vacation, and who are meeting with us on the other hand, who are following all of their processes.
Arda Ermut recalled that international direct investments (UDY) in Turkey last year amounted to $12.3 billion, saying, "I think we will definitely beat it this year.
"But how far we will pass, these regional developments, global ambiguities will affect".
While hoping that its normally impact would be greater, perhaps a little more limited, Ermut pointed out that as of the first five months it had gone up by 11 per cent, indicating that it could be protected, "I believe that if, God willing, if there is no bad development, we will definitely close the end of the year one way or the other than last year".
Citing that a significant portion of the withdrawal investments would continue to become real estate, Ermut informed that new investments could be seen in logistics, health, fintech, IT, petro-chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing.
Emphasizing that there will be new investments to be made in the coming months, Ermut said, "We may have an investment announcement in the sense of manufacturing soon."
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a big investment.
"There may also be investments from interesting countries". he assessed.
Operation in 9 provinces to 4 wine companies: 55 detentions
İstanbul Anti-Smuggling Department teams have determined that the foil coating covering the fungal tap on which 4 wine companies sell products has been kept long and loose, not glued to the bottle, but the TAPDK bandrolls glued on the coating have been collected after the products have been sold and marketed for the newly produced wines.
Olis teams have suggested that the state has lost US$20,400,000 in taxes due to the repeated use of the bandrolls of suspects.
Police teams launched simultaneous operations today to 55 addresses including four wine companies’ factories and warehouses in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdağ, Bursa, Balıkesir, Manisa, Aydın, Denizli and Nevşehir.
A total of 55 people were detained in the operation, while calls included 15,000 sold-out wines, 52,480 used many times, wine bottles filled with TAPDK bandrolls, 12,890 TAPDK bandrolled hoodies, 3 pistols and bullets, 100 boxes of sexual content pills, 992 smuggled cigars, 698 bottles of fake booze and 100 litres of anise essssane.
55 people detained were brought into the Department of the Anti-Smuggling Crimes Department located on Vatan Street.
The suspects are still in the police department.
Their team's operation to the factories, warehouses and businesses was reflected in police cameras.
Police teams made a call in a warehouse to take off the hoods that were on ready-to-sale wine bottles.
Police teams have been recorded examining bags of TAPDK bandrolled hoods collected from used bottles.
How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar's going to Paris?
Rules for the prevention of unlimited spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring world records from Barcelona, Spain to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
The management unit, which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament, overseeing the European game, could result in all kinds of results from UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain.
Financial Fair Game rules issued by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar funded its transfer without massive losses.
Barcelona has been paid 222m euros ($262m) just to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will rule over a salary that will find tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some financial aspects of Neymar's departure to France include:
Given the team's money from the energy-rich Qatari family, PSG can certainly pay the money to sign Neymar and add it to the other galaxy of stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to get players, but they have to balance it with legitimate sources of income as long as they're in charge of their football-related business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini, after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs who had been in great debt in pursuit of success had committed effective fraud and were at risk of bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the FFP began monitoring its losses rather than concentrating on the debt of clubs.
The change meant that the model Roman Abramovic first used in Chelsea in 2003 (take a club with potential, spend a lot of money to improve the team and create a global brand) would become a more difficult attempt.
During the three-year FFP evaluation period, which continues until 2018, clubs can suffer 30m euros in losses.
Although Platini was disreputablely suspended from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Cefer, is still determined to be waived from excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso, who manages the FFP in UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "FFP is certainly not dead and we will surely strengthen by moving the rules forward."
Although PSG will pay Neymar's purchase clause collectively, it may spread the amount to contract time for accounting reasons.
Neymar signed a five-year deal so that the transfer fee can be cited as a cost of 44.4m euros in next 5 years' annual accounts.
The first wave in 2014 saw the implementation of the heaviest accommodations to Manchester City, owned by FFP muays, PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined 60m euros ($82 million for then) which was later reduced to 20m euros, and was ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of normally 25 for the 2014–2015 season.
UEFA is alert to clubs that may attempt to deceive financial regulators by inflating its income through companies linked to the owners of the club.
Although a Qatari company can sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship is thought to exceed standard market values, UEFA will not allow this to be counted as a justifiable income.
That's what happened in UEFA 2014 when the Qatar Tourism Authority ruled that PSG sponsorship was inflated.
Some of Neymar's earnings from PSG were reported to have come through payments from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied Neymar would become World Cup envoy, and such a move could easily be revealed by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions imposed on the PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be even more careful against attempts to bypass the rules.
According to those who have established the issue on Tuesday, UEFA is not in a preemptive meeting with PSG on Neymar's transfer.
As they were not authorized to discuss PSG's situation, they spoke to The Associated Press on condition that they remain confidential.
Recent accounts show that PSG made more than 10m euros in 2015-16 with a turnover of 542.4m euros.
Last fiscal year's accounts have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship agreements, gift shop and jersey sales.
The club expects the turnover to increase by at least 30 per cent after signing.
The Spanish league, which was clearly annoyed by the departure of one of the football's greatest players, attempted to block Neymar's departure on the claim that PSG had violated the FFP.
"This is an open case of 'mali doping' with his club and state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's exact ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose own club belongs to an American sports giant, shares his concerns about the financing of La Liga by a state.
"This is the result of having it, and has completely changed the entire floor of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When a country has a club once, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because for a country such a great player representing a country can cause different methods or different interests.
Insurrection from insurers
According to TSB data, the insurance sector has been losing its traffic major since 2006.
In 2015, the sector lost $2.35 billion, and in 2016, only $19 million in profits.
The stock market is being processed in Istanbul, including Axigorta, Anatolian Insurance and Solar Insurance.
At a meeting where TSB's first six-month results were assessed in 2017, Ages said that 11 years of damage in traffic insurance had reached $7.3 billion, with ceiling premium implementation, they estimated that they estimated that the sector's damage would increase to $2.3 billion this year, the estimated damage-prime rate to 125 percent.
"It means that we are also increasing the price of the citizen's housing policy by financing the bad driver," said Ages, who said this year that the 2015 figure would be captured, noting that the damage written in 2012 and 2015 also took the profits of other majors.
"75 percent of the elector is foreign, and our partners abroad have in some sense funded the bad driver," he said.
The ages continued:
We don't expect any profit from traffic, but looking at the past 11 years, we can't show that we've made any.
"We agree to that, but we continue to hope that we can carry that damage in a reasonable environment, along with other policies," he said.
"In 2012 there were around 30 percent price increases in traffic insurance, almost doubled in 2015, we wrote the greatest damage in our history," the Ages said when the damage in traffic also took away the profitability of other products."
He said, "Even in an environment where the prices went up that high, at the end of 2016, our profits were only $19 million in traffic".
"We will lower the price of the good driver on the free tariff and put a high price on the bad driver on the free tariff," the Ages said next year.
"However, the Treasury looks at the general trend, the last word on when it will be is in the Treasury," he said.
The Undersecretary of the Treasury stated that the rise in mandatory traffic insurance premiums from 2015 affected a large part of the community, moving to maximum premium (tavan price) implementation from 12 April.
Accordingly, the maximum premiums on mandatory traffic insurance policies have been set in terms of the provincial groups, with each vehicle group, step and traffic density and accident statistics set in mind.
On the other hand, as of July, the mandatory traffic insurance policy has been implemented for damage frequency high step or vehicle groups in the "Rislid Insurance Pool".
Privilege and damage to traffic insurance policies under the pool will be split between insurance companies.
The premium on these insurers will be determined by the Undersecretary of the Treasury.
Ages said in traffic in the first 6 months of 2017, premium production declined by 11.5 per cent compared to the same period of the previous year, with the number of policies increasing by 4.9 per cent, to 8.6 million, and the reduction in traffic policies, given inflation, reached about 30 per cent.
"This damage cannot be sustained at these ceiling prices.
How much more can the industry take of this damage?"
"Why do foreigners finance the good driver bad driver, why do my thousands of shareholders finance the bad driver in Turkey?" said the Ages, saying that all companies in the sector have $9 billion in capital, when only $2.3 billion in traffic is damaged.
He said, "At this point, we're trying to tell the Treasury our problems."
Following these developments, the Ages said, "They are not there yet," following a question as to whether foreigners have reached a point of weight reduction in the Turkish insurance sector.
They expect to invest more in Turkey because there are an average of 6 policies per capita in the Netherlands, while this is 1.3 in Turkey.
"So Turkey is a place to really grow up," he said and went on.
So they haven't given up on this place.
However, the company earns a reasonable profit every year, but it uses all the profits to grow the company.
According to TSB data, premium production in the sector in 2016 was $40.5 billion, with a 12 per cent increase in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year at $23.1 billion.
Ages said the sector predicted that it would not complete the year with 15 per cent growth in total premium production.
News of welfare for thousands of chronic patients
At the instruction of Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, Minister of Family and Social Policies, details and implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Who Fight Chronic Diseases" were established which began work some time ago.
In the first phase, 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit from the outreach programme for poor citizens and their families.
Patients will receive monthly support over two thirds of the minimum wage, as well as regular psychosocial support.
The ministry will also pay additional payments to tuberculosis patients, identified by the relevant health unit, where they are unable to take care of their medical self-care, where they continue to live as dependents on the bed, or the need to improve home living conditions.
The payments will be made through Social Aid Cards, which will be provided via PTT.
For reasons such as geographical conditions, illness, disability, those who cannot go to withdraw money will be paid at the door.
In many ways, the program is also the first in the world.
One of the 10 companies to invest is still German.
Arda Ermut, head of the Turkish Investment Support and Promotion Agency, said German companies in Turkey are viewed as Turkish firms, and political tension between the two countries is not reflected in the business world.
"In relations with Germany, there is no investor who says, 'We've had trouble with this situation, we're running away.'"
"About 10% of the projects in our portfolio are for German companies."
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"The Germans are an important part of our daily workflow," he said.
Ermut also said that Abraaj Group's partnership with logistics company Netlog was a good example.
"We invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey," Abraaj Group Partner Omar Syed said, pointing to economic growth in Turkey.
Azer is on his way to becoming the Last Ottoman
It was reported that the veteran footballer, whom the administration gave two weeks to find a club, had signed with Ottomanspor, who would sign an official contract in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, Azer Hurcı signed a contract with the green-black club four hours before the transfer's end, playing 29 leagues, 2 cup games, while making a significant contribution to the team with his performance of 5 goals and 4 assists.
Closing the way back to Azer, the administration signed yesterday with Sergio Antonio of Brazil to replace this player.
The transfer of the century has happened!
Barcelona announced that Neymar was transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a price of 222 million euros.
Recently, the transfer development, which the football public has been eagerly pursuing, has been made official.
PSG recruited the Catalan team for the Brazilian player, paying 222 million euros, the player's release price, into the star name squad.
Neymar was the most expensive transfer in football history, along with the cost of this testimonial.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) of the French 1st Football League (Ligue 1) announced his five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
Neymar, 25, who became the world's most expensive footballer, was given 222m euros for the bonus termination fee, signed a contract he would play for PSG until 30 June 2022, the club's website said.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said he was very happy to play for the French representative, stating, "Since I started my football life in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most competitive and ambitious teams."
My reason for joining my teammates by coming to this club is to get many trophies as our fan wishes".
PSG will pay Neymar 45m euros each season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the French representative over 400m euros.
The naval workers' strike ended with a raise
The agreement between İzmir Metropolitan Municipality’s company IZDİZİŞ. and Turkish-Business’s Turkish Maritime Union (TDS) failed to reach an agreement on the increase in the collective contract.
And then the union workers went on strike on July 12.
The strike, which lasted nearly a month, ended as of 3 p.m. today after a raise for workers.
According to the collective agreement signed, the salary of land personnel within the ISS will be increased by 12 per cent.
In addition to the Revenue Tax exemption from re-enlisting its fleet, the rate accepted for personnel of shipman status increased by 25 percent is 5 per cent.
The Directorate General of the United States has announced that flights in the interior bay will continue with normal tariffs, and the campaigns in Yassicaada will begin Tuesday, and Foça and Urla from next weekend.
TDS President Hassan Pekdemir stated that they had locked up transportation with their 23-day strike, saying: "Izmir people will be relieved."
As a result of the strike, improvements have been made to our workers working on land and sea.
We leave the table contentedly.
An average share of 28 per cent will be placed in the sea employee pocket and 20 per cent on land.
We had friends who worked at minimum wage.
We also made serious improvements in their salaries.
Nostalgia becomes Nisch with "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective".
Well, for the characters' bright days in the '80s, for the grunge period in the '90s (when brains such as David Wain and Michael Showalter made sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and himself, for 2001, before their star Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd continued with bigger things, this version of the story was nostalgic for all of them.
As a cultural product, this is both the theatricalization and the embodiment of our ever-remembered Facebook era.
But as a series, it's like it's running out of time.
"The First Day of Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and this was not only due to his absurd humor (in which was a story about the origins of a talking box of plants, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin.)
Focusing on the main humor (the middle-aged actors playing horny children of age) made it impossible to recapture the past part of the joke.
It's now less emotional-resistant in "Ten Years Later" where adults play adults, and its parody is more random, including a monologue about a perverted follower movie like "The Hand That Shakes the Cradle" of the '90s.
At some point, the character mixes up an Apple Powerbook, some single-line roller skates, and "a lot of other things from 1991."
Many of the original stories are the same.
The softhearted Coop (Mr. Showalter) is now a writer, still unable to forget Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
There is also another crazy treacherous plan now involved by Ronald Reagan (again Mr. Showalter), who has been driven by George H. W. Bush (a very well-sitted imitation by Michael Ian Black).
The best part of the series, as usual, are intermediate words.
It's especially nice to see young Mr. Rudd, who always has Matt Dillon's under-lip beard in "The Singles," whose Andy, the most popular boy in the old school, now seems like an old man.
There may be random moments of insanity that empower this series (such as the series of "Seven Up!"") until it reaches what I think is the logical result of: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", in which the group of friends are allowed to go see the premiere of the film "Wet Hot American Summer".
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" in Amazon addresses a different form of nostalgia: "The Americans"' Cold War revivalism, film "The Bomb of Yellow" and even "GLOW" with its iconography against East, Western wrestling.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy directed by Rhys Thomas, appears to be found TV: a 1980s Romanian police friends drama in which two Bucharest police officers fought for the real, atheism and Marxist-Leninist road.
The lead roles are played by the wolf Gregor and the idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, with the English dub of their dialogue being done by Channing Tatum (who is also the lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levittt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice visual humors (Americans spend time watching chess on TV while watching football)
The famous cast of voice artists, among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny; it's good material for the "know who" game.
But "Comrade Detective" is so dedicated to the fact that a clumsy propaganda drama is being compared to reality (including a murderer wearing a Reagan mask), he often plays just like it.
Six long episodes don't go by, and comedy isn't quick enough or often enough.
Gregor and Iosef were constantly visiting the American embassy, where there were two fat men in his lobby who always ate a stack of hungry wolves, while "Comrade Detective" could have done better with the propaganda satire if it had been shortened to a narrower length.
The message to the imaginary communist watcher is that Western culture can convert food into food that will defeat anything in a series.
The Romanian creators were not wrong: we are doing this to our own close past and even theirs.
FETÖ's ancestor, the Ancients.
The British government has seen our family loyal and devoted after fifty years of experience.
The supreme authorities of the government have acknowledged that this family has been sincerely committed to the British Government and has done great service.
The British Government has to be smart and careful about this sapling that it has planted with its own hands, investigate and examine everything carefully, and make a decision carefully.
While trying to understand FETÖ, the organization of the Hashahish as the starting point is addressed, but one important difference forgotten is that FETÖ is an organization that emerged during the imperialist period and acts with colonial sakis.
I think the "frontive movement" that needs to be handled in this minivan is the Ancients.
In the British praise at the entrance, the person who describes himself as 'the plant planted by the British Government' is Mirza Gulam Ahmet Kadiyâni, the founder of Kadiyanlik.
A small town in Punjab, India, Kadiyan-born Gulam Ahmed, reported that "On December 1, 1888, God ordered him to take a pledge from his followers and to form a separate congregation."
Gulam Ahmed went a little further, saying that in 1891, according to the revelation and inspirations he received, Jesus b. Mary died of a death of course, like other prophets, that God had sent her as the messiah and the Mahd, whom Christians and Muslims had been waiting for.
Accordingly, he is the same person that Muslims expect, and this is Mirza Gulam Ahmed Kadiyânî.
(Encyclopaedia of Islam, TDV)
In India, which came under complete British rule after the Sipahi uprising of 1857, Gulam Ahmed, writing books defending persecuted Muslims against Hindus and Christians, reminds me of the Gulen portrait defending Islam with the Presidency of the Anti-Communism Association in Erzurum, which is thought to have been founded with purely sacrosanctic saiks, but whose CIA support later emerged.
Like Gülen, Gulam Ahmed's most beloved idea by imperialists is that "cihad" is only a struggle with the Muslim's own self and that imperialism has no dimension to fight if you can live freely.
In fact, if you remember, Laughing went one step further, praising the attacks of the Crusaders, whose wound was still open in our history, in a 'vaaz' last year, said: "It is not too dangerous for the pilgrim to invade your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
First of all, they don't touch your woman, they don't touch your daughter.
They won't touch your temple, crusaders unattached!
The idea that the Mahdi and the messiah are united itself, that its own community will be the savior of Islam, aside from the similarity of the treatises to FETÖ, as the concept of jihad means only fighting the soul, the form of Kadiyanism has generally taken place in the field of education and civil society.
The total number of cities in the world, said to have exceeded 2 million of its 'tributes', is 1869, with the number of countries officially registered as the "Humanity First".
Also among the data are 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 printing press owned only in Africa; 505 educational institutions in 11 countries; and about 16,000 mosques worldwide.
Considering that the Nobel Prize-winning "first Muslim scientist" Prof. Abdulselam, the United Nations Justice Court-chairman Sir Zazullah Khan, the Muslim actor who received the first Oscar award, Mahershala Ali, was also Kadıyani, we can see more clearly the depth of global powers' approval to the Kadians.
Let's note that last week's meeting with 30,000 people in England was also polished as a body show.
A brief glimpse of their history is enough to understand that the Kadiyanites, one of their slogans is "Love everyone, hate no one", actually means "love your occupiers/ your colonists."
It is possible to drive the origin point and motivations of such constructions as Hulasa, FETÖ, or Tahir-ul Kadri to the Kadians, and all of these organizations are actually supported as a matriarch to pass through imperialism and to corrupt societies in order to serve colonialism.
His "last request" came out of the cargo.
Emily Pomeranz (50), who spent her last days in a hospital in Washington due to pancreatic cancer, expressed her longing for a coffee and chocolate-mixed milkshake (milk drink) of a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of hers contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who had run the same restaurant for 47 years, put the drink on dry ice and also paid the fee of $123 (435), sending it to the hospital "fast delivery" cargo 600 kilometers away.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
To date, Ahmet Kul Construction, which has implemented important projects such as Lavinya Park, Autoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has put on sale Dia Mare in Istanbul Mimarikoba, and Solse 7 projects in Bodrum Yalıkavak.
The geometry of the project Dia Mare, whose architecture was developed by Pineoglu Architecture, was developed to take the maximum benefit from the sea.
Located on an area of 11,000 square feet, Dia Mare features a total of 188 housing and 17 commercial units.
The project, whose rough structure is completely finished, will begin to be handed over to its new owners on March 2018.
Dia Mare has numerous circle types ranging from 2+1 to 5+1.
In 2018, the company is preparing to sign for two major projects in Topkapi, which will launch two more new construction sites in Mimarikoba and Bitez later this year.
He transferred 753 million to the subsidiary companies
Peace Co-worker 6,760 staff members said that many programs had been made outside the TRT and that they had been paid the extreme prices.
The CHP deputy again drew the public's taxes at "TRT 2016" against AKP-based companies.
"It's called a robbery," he said...
The source TRT transferred to its subsidiary production companies was revealed with data from official documents.
The official response to CHP İstanbul MP Barış Ydaş’s application under the Information Act revealed how TRT’s resources were spent.
In TRT, where 6,760 people work as staff, he said, although there are all kinds of technical opportunities, full 753m,500,000 dollars were transferred to subsidiary companies in 2016 through programs built under the external production name.
The MP with the CHP used the phrase, "This means a hit."
"Production companies of AKP journalists and businessmen are looting TRT."
He said, "Millions are paid for productions that are not watched or filmed".
"The institution, which has 7,000 staff, has turned into a barley of the AKP," he reminded companies that the money was raised from the taxes of the people.
"What programs did these companies sign on that 7,000 people couldn't?" he reacted.
Explaining that TRT's 2016 advertising revenue was $224,456,182, he said that advertising income remained a camel's ear when it came to employee salaries and other expenses.
"TRT, which has become the AKP's voice, can't get publicity because it's not being watched."
Feeding journalists receive money from TRT, shouting for AKP.
He said, "The people are pulling the weight."
"TRT pays staff $660 million a year; but it gives all the work to external productions," said the CHP fellow.
753.5 trillion followers have been withdrawn from TRT's pocket.
That's just plain outrageous.
He gave up his suicide, kneeled down before his wife and apologized.
The incident occurred in a parking lot in Eyüpoğlu neighbourhood of Mill Street at noon today.
According to reports, residents who saw the citizen hanging down from the 4th floor of the parking lot reported the situation to fire departments and paramedics.
Fire departments arriving at the scene opened a tarp in the area of the individual, while paramedics were standing by.
Jonah G., a 34-year-old father who had stopped committing suicide after nearly an hour of convincing efforts by psychologist and police teams called to the scene, knelt before his wife N.G., who watched him in tears.
On the other hand, about 100 people sat on the sidewalks in the street of Yunus G., who attempted suicide, while some citizens recorded on cell phones.

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will not change soon after it reduces speculation that slow economic growth and moving inflation will be an increase.
Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue "slowly", as it keeps their interest rates constant, along with the contraction of family revenues.
Decisionmakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest at 0.25%; thus, less members this month asked for an increase after slow economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In the quarterly inflation report, the bank drew growth estimates to 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018, and warned householders that household revenues would continue to contract, with inflation still expected to increase near 3% in the spring.
However, he signaled that interest increases were needed to rein in inflation fueled by Brexit over the next few years, and said debt costs may have to increase more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted after Brexit to withdraw part of the massive economic healing package launched a year ago.
The bank said it will end the Periodic Funding Plan, which offers cheap funding to banks from next February, but expects it to offer £15 billion more (aggregate £115 billion) under the plan.
Minutes after the interest decision was made, the bank said: "The central estimate of the MPC continues slowly in the short term as the gross domestic product (GSYH), the contraction of domestic real income, continues to be a burden on consumption."
On interest, he stressed that "a little narrowing in monetary policy" could be necessary for easing inflation and that the market would be "a bit higher" than expected.
Markets still estimate that the first increase will be in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase will be "step by step" and "limited".
According to May estimates, the bank's reduced growth estimates this year and next year are compared to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintains its estimate of 1.8% in 2018.
After the report, Sterling lost value against dollars and euros.
The pound fell 0.5%, dropping $1.31 US dollars and 0.4%, making it 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change came after the last disappointing growth figures eased the growing expectations, with GDP being 0.2% in the previous three months, according to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The growth will likely remain 0.3% in the third quarter, but according to the bank, it will begin to increase slightly by the end of the year.
While the bank says the contraction will worsen before it recovers, the latest inflation report leaves little to be happy with households who were hit by increased inflation and small salary increases.
The bank said that money policy could not "block" revenues hitting over the next few years, but expected salaries to improve "to a significant extent" towards the end of their three-year forecast.
As a result of the weak pound, increasing demand for British goods will support the economy by balancing some of its reduced consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were reduced to 0.25% in August following the shock EU referendum vote, which took the pound upside down.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully affect prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's latest interest decision, there was an increased demand for inflation pressure on the hard-pressed households and a rising interest increase by three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation declined from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected and would increase once again in the coming months.
According to their 2% goal, the vaccine is "completely" related to weak pounds, the bank said.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said, "The mortgage market will become even more competitive once again, given the recent declines in taco rates, while lenders have a demand for business to be done and a positive closure of the year.
Sunday; in mortgages, it looks particularly good for those approaching the end of their current contracts, with many free options and low interest, becoming more popular than ever."
NHS will prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
In the Supreme Court, after a fight over funding the drug in the NHS, patients will be able to reach 'translating' HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England has announced that pre-existence prophysics (PREP), a pill taken before sex, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86 percent, will be provided by health care to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
He agreed to finance the experiment following the Supreme Court's approval of the Court of Appeals last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for the PREP, despite allegations that local authorities would finance it.
This move, announced Thursday, was received as a 'new and serious intervention' by the president of NHS England, Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'turn point'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to record the public, with more clinics participating in October, being fully implemented by April 2018 across the UK.
Pre-examination profilerxia (PREP) is a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of HIV infection before sex.
Trials showed that the PREP significantly reduced HIV transfer among those at risk of infection.
Getting a PREP before sex means there's enough drugs in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
These drugs can be taken every day or almost two hours before they have sex.
The appropriate ones for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and HIV-positive partners who cannot be successfully treated.
Clinics will determine eligible participants who will consent to the experiment from men, women, transsexual individuals, and those whose partners' HIV status is controlled by an anti-retroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a practitioner will also be able to register for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold £10 million, and NHS signed an agreement to provide the drugs this week with an international tender.
The trial was designed to assess the full potential of the PREP by collecting clinical evidence on how the PrEP was targeted, conducted and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This new and serious intervention will contribute to extensive and increasing successful efforts in preventing HIV.
This is another milestone in the thirty-year development of overcoming one of humanity's major health problems.'
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a turning point in fighting HIV.
If targeted correctly in those in need and those at risk, the PREP offers the possibility of transforming the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, people with high HIV risk will reach a new and powerful vehicle, which is really controlled by the NHS in the UK, through this experiment, which is funded by the NHS, and is not open to negotiation with a mate; this will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly.'
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority right now should be to ensure that the experiment is presented quickly across the country and that no one with HIV risk is left behind.
Now that the PREP experimental drug has been supplied, we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'We welcome that the PREP experiment has begun, and it has been late with months of delays and then the government's resilience.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our view of HIV prevention and the termination of this life-changing infection.
The experiment will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of the PREP.
Now it's important that this experiment protects people who are exposed to HIV and is presented as quickly as possible across the country to bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.

Two secrets. Death.
İmit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51) daughter of former Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Chilingiroğlu, who was born in Washington, died from falling down from the 19th floor of a business centre, which was also used as a hotel in Istanbul Levent.
Koç University student Melis Salihoğlu, 24, was also found dead in his home.
It has been suggested that Salihoğlu hanged himself.
Two secret death investigations were launched, one after another, which were considered suicides by police officers.
'There's been a period of time.'
Turkey's first Minister of Industry and Trade, Ayhan Chilingiroğlu, who served in the government of Nihat Erim in 1971, had his daughter, Umit Makbule Chilingiroğlu, born in Washington in 1966, entering the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler on August 1st at 5 p.m.
An ambulance and police team were called to the scene after a Kuwaiti tourist who had settled in the room on the 19th floor and had seen the lifeless body of Chilingiroğlu who had not been heard from for some time.
The medical team determined that Chillingiroğlu, who had fallen from the 19th floor to hard ground, had lost his life.
"He had been depressed lately," said the mother, Mediha Chilingiroglu, who testified to the police.
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on 31 July.
I have a grandson with leukemia from my other daughter.
"This was taking care of my grandson and was negatively affected by my granddaughter's illness," he said.
Chillingiroğlu, whose body has been removed to the Forensic Medicine Agency, is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It's being investigated whether or not Chingiroglu was thrown out by someone or committed suicide.
'CANINA ENTER' ADVICE
The other suspected death in Istanbul occurred in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoğlu (24) who studied at Koç University has been found dead in his home.
The young girl's father allegedly went to her daughter's house near the school, where she could not hear or reach her cell phone.
The father met his daughter's lifeless body at home.
It was suggested that Melis, who was loved by his family, close circle and friends, had ended his life by hanging himself in his home.
The death of Melis Salihoğlu overwhelmed his family and relatives by the law.
Following Melis, a friend said on social media, "A bright sun was hitting us in the face."
The green grass under our feet, your best friend Jack and your sister Eyshan and I were in a good mood when we were chasing that little plastic ball.
He shared the message, "It was not necessary for him to die now."
Living the luxuries: hanging floor and smart design numbers turned this little Earls Courts apartment into a spacious home.
Former banker Joanne Leigh, who had a passion for real estate remodeling, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to the apartment in Earls Court to shrink.
It's a proof of the new design on the first floor of a swanky Queen Anne-style gazebo and Joanne's convinced without packing her bags.
"Before that, I was living in a much larger area in Knightsbridge with my ex-boyfriend," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something equal to my price.
The apartment at Earl Court was shown to me, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
After the initial sighting, the 1000 ft square circle was renovated from top to bottom.
It was originally a one-room and complex planned property; you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom, Joanne wanted to add a storage area and a pad to maximize the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and a lot of light.
That was my condition," he said.
To this end, he hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill-based architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to take advantage of the 12.5 ft ceiling and create not only a structure but also a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces in a row, so the architectural difficulty was to create a padded floor in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the matter.
"The steel skeleton is very complicated," he explains.
"We had to adjust the gaps so that they could pile up without needing to lean down on each other.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but also the steels would be so bent that they would be at the right height according to the function at the top or bottom."
This arrangement also brought many additional dramas, allowing Erfan to obtain two full-length rooms above each other.
The old-type copper light window, taken from Retrouvius for the hanging floor, looks down at the magnificent habitat below.
The mirrored gold furniture, the silver accents, and the old-fashioned Serge Mouille lighting all determines the style of the bill.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of space, space and light.
Mirrors placed at both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored ranger panel makes it feel like a window to another room.
Mirrored units in the hall provide storage space for Joanne's entire cutlery kit and zuccanier.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a greater sense of space, is to close the kitchen when it's not in use.
Opens and closes kitchens are not new.
What's original about this is that it's a garage-style upliftable door.
"We used some engineering in this," explains Erfan, the steel-powered polished MDF door.
"There's a weight of pitch, so when you push the door up, it really slides."
With the clever use of the field and the storage area, Joanne has won an additional 16 square feet, an extra bedroom and a improved session plan.
"At the end of the day, the session area becomes what you will sell, or the value of your property is determined," Erfan says.
"As a result, a real estate agent will go in and make a calculation of the session area."
Here they were able to use quality material that gave the area its luxurious appearance while increasing ground space.
"Mades are objects you touch, and thus help you to bond emotionally at home," Erfan says.
"At home, you don't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
These are important, but they don't shake the strings of your heart."
This is proof that through good design and increased square feet, an apartment can turn from something standard to something quite spectacular.
Actually, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens in Beşiktaş with his testimonial
After a month and a half of talks, he was transferred to Beşiktaş with a Lens testimonial, originally thought to be on loan.
After talks intensified over the last week, Lens signed with the Black-and-White team for the price of 5m euros in testimonials.
A five-year deal was learned that the Dutch player would receive 2.2m euros annually.
Beşiktaş is expected to make an official statement regarding the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Wedding photos of famous couples
About four years of ups and downs, model Çağla Shekel and actor and singer Emre Altuğ entered the world house in Sortie.
The couple immortalized the wedding ceremony, which they called "the most special moment of our lives", with the photograph taken.
The couple decided to split up seven years later.
The brothers are fighting over the $500 million estate empire.
Two brothers are at war for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, forty years after the dynasty established by Italian families.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who gave himself to the Supreme Court about how to divide properties and business assets in a mansion in Toorak.
Paul had wanted out of the family business since 2014, but fierce discussions were ongoing in the Supreme Court about the disintegration.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties in Smith Street, Collingwood, which have been worth more than half a billion dollars saved since a store they bought in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and raised him in a chain with 160 retail outlets.
Sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was deposited on the property, and De Lutis' portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento construction sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and malls in the suburb.
As part of an agreement with their deceased father, Colin (who is described by Paul as "a significant driving force and a dominant personality" in the family of De Lutis) has two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul has one-third of its assets.
A court file says this means that Colin has $316 million and Paul has $176 million worth of property.
Splitting the property and cash for Paul is a matter of contention.
In his first affidavit to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The divisions proposed by Colin were leaving him with what I always considered to be the best."
The first High Court hearing was held last Friday after several failed mediations.
The brothers are also fighting over who will control the current business; Paul claims Colin left him out of the business.
Colin argues that is not true, but accuses Paul of inept management of certain properties.
Colin, in a sworn statement at first, says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs in the case are increasing, along with hundreds of pages of sworn testimony, e-mails, and top lawyers such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal counsel held by both parties, recorded by firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were an Italian immigrant family running grocery stores and delis from the late 1950s and had purchased a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They pawned their property to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first denim shop.
Colin says he founded Westco there "in my last years of high school, when Paul was a little boy (aged 10)".
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to leave their property friendly to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted brothers to fall into court," he wrote.
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colin said that when he quit, Mark was paid $10 million, and Luke was paid $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark were "unsatisfied with the terms of their financial separation," Paul said.
According to Eddi McGuire's 2015 biography, the television star's best friend, Colin tried not to draw attention to himself even though he was a former AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and his lawyers on Friday.
Only because Colin was in court with the text message, he replied, "I can't say much."
"It must have been very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and drag our family's name into the courts," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin had written in a court application that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I to fall into the current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful about the solution."
On Friday, that hope seems to have disappeared.
"Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do this.
That would be the first time.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports), hoping to keep the boss more stable.
Some small information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House's new chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first day at work, he summarized a fundamental problem that President Donald Trump planned to solve regarding the White House: the passing of bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told staff that information, whether on paper or briefings, had to flow through him, because the president could make better decisions when good information was given.
Kelly's diagnosis sounds very meaningful, but others tried to tame Trump by overseeing the media diet and failed.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and now he's at the White House, his TV-watching habits are still good.
A former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February, "If Aday Trump was upset that he had not been fair in the media, it was efficiency-enhancing to show him that he had found a fair place in convincing media outlets."
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time, "According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control was to ensure that personal media consumption involved a steady flow of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign guys know something the rest of us don't, like Trump's tweets would be a lot more provocative if they didn't intervene.
We'll probably never know anything about tweets Trump didn't send.
If his people were able to get him out of danger a few times, then his efforts were valuable.
But no one could stop Trump from creating constant controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House consisted of factions competing with each other, or people who, in any case, tried to advance their own agenda with the material they presented to Trump (these could be reliable or unreliable), and who brought forward their own world views.
In May, Politico had reported, throughout this whole story, that consultants were strategically inclined to communicate questionable information to the president.
One example that reporter Shane Goldmacher described in detail was:
"The current and former Trump officials say Trump reacted furiously from the press to negative clippings, especially to leaks that had a bad effect, and was drawn to finding out where they originated.
It was also at the end of February when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article from Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com, accusing assistant chief of staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It was of no importance that Johnson had been banned for good due to harassment from Twitter, or offered no concrete evidence, or had filed false charges in the past, and had returned from them.
Trump read the article and began to ask staff questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter were "trying to install a system that handled and documented documents taken by Trump".
How did that work out?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing in three months.
Perhaps he will appear as a more influential manager than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own impulse and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Crypto has revealed the FETÖ's in a special template
İzmir Public Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya completed the investigation launched as part of the investigation into the irregularities in the "military espionage investigation" and the leak of some information, under the code "Smarriage", after the Chief of Staff of the Navy, Major Jihad Yaycı, said he was a FETÖist."
The study emphasized that, contrary to the fact that the Vice Admiral Sagittarius was not a member of the organization, he assisted in the decoding of members of the crypto organization at the Naval Command and played an active role in the fight against FETÖ.
The decision stated that Yaycı was trying to be pacified by order of the Navy Command in accordance with the so-called martial law order in the coup attempt on July 15 was highlighted as having fought effectively against FETÖ from the first day of the coup attempt.
The decision on non-tracking made by Karakaya used the following statements: "It was discovered that the publisher was working on the detection of crypto Navy Command personnel through the special template for the detection of FETÖ members of the crypto class of private services and the special system created through 209 sub-species with 64 basic criteria."
It has been decided that a preemptive, private and stubborn zeal has been observed in forensic investigations, as there is no evidence about the secret witness except for its aphaki and unfounded declaration, as opposed to the fact that it exhibited the opposite, it is not possible for an estimated assessment of the Yaycı, who is known to be anti-active terrorist organization and whose major contributions in this direction, to be valued by our attorney general.
He had been tried before on charges of defamation.
It was also revealed that there were FETÖists behind this, and that the alleged crime was a conspiracy.
Former Air Pilot Staff Colonel Hakan Dinc, who complained that Yaycı had insulted him, was the former Adana İncirlik 10 who turned the complaint into a document that was only in the form of an information note.
Tanker Base Commander Air Pilot Brigadier General Bakir Ercan Van, former Chief of Staff Chief of Staff Coroner Colonel Muharrem Köse, former Chief of Staff Intelligence Chairman Mustafa Özsoy, former Judge Major Erkan Ağın, who had given permission to prosecute, has been expelled from Kurıy as a witness against former Chief of Staff Captain Akif Us and former Judge Serdar Çamiçi and Yaycı.
Some members of the organisation, including the FETÖ fugitive Tuncay Opchin, were found to have targeted Yaycı with their share in social media before and after the coup attempt on July 15th.
Travelers crossed the moat, returned to 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the wealthiest hosts in the West Midlands are fighting again with the tenacious travelers who crossed the ditch dug by the council to reclaim the area outside their own estate.
Travellers parked 20 of their trailers outside an area with Solihull in good condition and referred to as the 'rich neighborhood'.
They returned just after being fired in May, bringing horses, babies, and a load of wagons from the ditch the council had dug to cut off their raids.
The smart-acting group found a gap in defense, leaking their vehicles in by setting up a path through a section that had been left unblocked.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council in comparison, saying it was 'ineffectual in solving the problem'.
An unnamed resident said: "They arrived there Monday evening after being sent out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.
The council should be ashamed of their actions because they are useless at solving the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were sent away, and now they're back again.
More came last night, possibly more will come today."
He added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it with long suspension decisions taken to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street and I'm not happy to continue paying my taxes when the council can't even stop it.'
A local resident who did not want to give his name said, 'Like a joke, we have just seen the last group of travelers depart, which we are immediately devastated by a new group.
Their numbers had increased this time, and a horse was even seen grazing in the parking lot.'
A female spokesperson from the Solihull Council said: 'We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on the Streetsbrook Street property, we are launching the legal procedures necessary to get them out of there as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents call 101 and report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help bring out the picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to the court.'

It's a last-day rush!
They're storming fire stations.
Thousands of vehicles were damaged in Istanbul last Thursday, along with the storm and hail.
Many of the drivers who received reports from the fire department for the damages to be covered by insurance companies did their notifications, while drivers who had not received reports so far also queued for the report.
Drivers who were his helmet today but did not report came to fire stations and asked for a report, as this was the last day of the notice.
Today is the last day.
Drivers first had fire departments take pictures of their vehicles to identify the damage to their vehicles.
Drivers with damage detection of their vehicles then filed a report to the officials.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, "I've got a recording and I'm going to take a picture."
There was a lot of intensity when I got here.
"There was damage to the windshield," he said.
Driver Erbil Sword, "We're here in a hurry."
We're in line.
We got the picture taken.
"Now we wait for the report," he said.
The skyscrapers that are walled by the sea and the land don't breathe.
"The expert report in the case clearly says that these structures will not withstand earthquakes at the severity of 6", Councillor Radir Ataman of the CHP warned of earthquakes as to the massive structures rising on the beach."
It is stated that the stakes, with the solid rock 25 to 30 meters below, are not so deeply engraved.
The high-rise hotel and residences building a wall between the sea and land on the beach left the district breathless.
Councillor Radir Ataman of Bakırköy Municipality of CHP reacted to giant mall, hotel and residence projects, which rose one after the other in the district.
Noting that the structures on the beach cut the wind, Ataman said "80 years ago, those planning according to the wind had created the Ataturk Forest to Floria.
80 years later, they planted giant skyscrapers in the wind corridors and changed the climate, just as the idea of urbanism had reached its point.
He said, "There's no breathing in the interior."
"The temperature is felt 10 degrees more because of skyscrapers," Ataman said, expressing that rising buildings like walls on the coast of Ataköy changed the balance of the climate.
These buildings need to be built in the direction of the winds.
But our skyscrapers are rising above Istanbul's wind corridors.
The wind can't get into the county.
These structures are destabilizing natural life.
Ataman has stated that these skyscrapers that have damaged the environment and human health have also cut off the connection of the Bakırköy people to the sea, saying they will appeal to the Board of Monuments on the issue and go to the judicial path.
It's possible to treat without surgery in a hair spin.
Phenolic cases show up to 83 per cent success.
In this method, the diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue cavity is filled with an agent who kills the hair follicles.
Another of the non-operative hairspin treatment techniques is the laser method.
With a variety of lasers, the hair roots and the tissue around it are burned by circular radiated rays, which allow tissues to be shut down by sticking during the combustion.
Through these two non-operable methods of hair spinning disease, patients are able to return to social and business life in less time.
Dr. Mert Atak, who stated that overweight, dormant life, long-term sit-down work, intense hair and non-hygienic rules caused hair rotation, claimed that symptoms of the disease include pain, infection, abscess, and swelling in the tail socket.
Italy toughens NGOs' approach to immigrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue unless they follow new rules affecting their operations.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new charter, it will be difficult to see them continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities were seized on a boat operated by the German charity Jugend Rettet, whose crew suspected that they were actively collaborating with human traffickers in an effort to facilitate illegal immigration.
The charity, which has only been active for a year, refused to comment on the content of detailed accusations against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"The saving of human life for us is our top priority and it will be, so we are very sorry that we can't work in the search and rescue area right now," the agency said in a statement on social media.
"Only after we have gathered all the information and have been able to assess the situation can we make an assessment of the charges currently being made."
Italian officials had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, Iuventa, since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken on boats full of rubber immigrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers, allowing smugglers to escape on boats to be used again.
According to the prosecutor's files published by the Italian media, at least one such meeting allegedly took place 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The crew is under suspicion of disregarding the Italian coast guard's authority, which oversees rescue operations in the area due to humanitarian effort rather than any other purpose.
According to the charter, there was supposed to be an Italian police officer on the deck of boats such as Iuventa who was clearly watching their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the charter: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The last of these said on Tuesday that he considered that the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable because he would not cause any "serious changes or obstacles" in his own rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign are the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescues in the past weeks was a sign that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal security and co-operation with local governors were paying off.
"We have recently begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," he said.
This month, he announced plans for further talks with Libyan governors on economic development initiatives and to take measures to reduce the number of immigrants leaving Chad, Niger and Mali in hopes of reaching Europe.
Last-minute punch!
In Moscow, Russia, the day of the "paratrooper troops" celebrations, watermelons were eaten and vodka drank, as was every year.
A Russian who attended the event and drank too much alcohol attacked Russian NTV television reporter Nikita Razvozjayev, who broadcast live at Gorki Park.
On live television, the reporter, who quoted the developments of the day, warned the man who suddenly appeared and swore, "We're going to contain Ukraine". "Please stop".
The drunk man, who was stated to be a former paratrooper, punched him hard on the reporter's warning.
The reporter, stunned by his punch, tried to get away from the man.
Millions watched the moment of shock live.
The Economic Coordination Board has convened
The Economic Co-ordination Board (ECK) met with Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek in charge of the economy.
Following a cabinet reshuffle in the government, the first ECK meeting, headed by Yıldırım, began at 6:30 p.m. at Çankaya Mansion.
The meeting will focus on Turkey's macroeconomic outlook.
Minister of Finance Naci Ağbal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Labor and Social Security Jülide Sarieroğlu, Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci, Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan, Undersecretary of Treasury Osman Çelik, President of the Central Bank Murat Çetinkaya and related bureaucrats.
It's possible to get rid of the hernia in 45 minutes.
Noting that only 5 per cent of patients should be operated on in hernia treatment, Prof. Dr. Oğuz Karaemin children say, "The first step is rest and medication, according to the patient's examination and imaging results."
The sons of Oğuz Karaemin, who have specifically warned that entrepreneurial methods (such as epidural injection, radiofrequency techniques, in-disc initiatives) in the patient group where pains continue, should be tried, "If all of these methods are not achieved, the numbness and weakness in the legs become evident, then surgery becomes mandatory."
Karaemin’s children state that 'full-closed hernia surgery' which minimizes the risk today also allows patients with invasive methods to decrease their reservations about surgery, saying that it is possible to recover from hernia disease in 45 minutes.
Microscopic surgery has had quite good results compared to open surgery, but there may be some complications following the operation, such as long recovery period, spinal attachments to the spinal cord, recurrence of the hernia, and a future hip shift and infection.
Microscopic surgery is often described as 'closed surgery' but microscopic surgery is also applied with the same approach as open surgery.
And in full-closed hernia surgery, these risks are eliminated because the surrounding tissues are preserved.
Full-closed hernia surgery only lasts 45 minutes.
Special commission's on the job.
The commission will include CHP MPs Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Peace Yçık and High Disciplinary Board member Turan Aydoğan.
The Commission held the 14th anniversary of Berberoğlu on October 4.
With his trial in the High Criminal Court, he will also follow appeals to the Constitutional Court and District Court of Invasion.
"It is the indispensable condition of justice that the judiciary be independent and impartial, that it receives no orders from anywhere but the law," CHP Secretary General Kamil Okyay Syur and Vice President Bülent Tezcan wrote in the letter of the commission, which includes his signature.
"Our deputy, Mr Enis Berberoğlu, did not request any special status while serving as MP, did not seek refuge in the immunity armor recognised by the MP, wanted to maintain his faith in the independence and neutrality of the judiciary".
The judicial process has been suggested that the court prefers to follow political orders rather than a trial.
The article argued that despite the Constitutional Court's rulings that found the arrest of MPs to be false, the decision was made before the verdict was finalised, a clear proof that the court had ruled under the influence.
Michelle Carter was fined for messages urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will serve the 15 months of her sentence behind bars and withdraw five years of her life as a legitimate release.
Carter was convicted on June 13, 2014, of the indemnity murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life.
Mr. Roy's father spoke at the Thursday hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to be released to be on the right track.
Although he faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, his own legal team had argued that both he and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Carter, who wore red pants and a cream-colored blouse, was punished with teary eyes, his hands flaxed and his eyes facing the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
He ended his life to heal his.
He didn't accept the responsibility," he said.
"He showed no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation that he completely regretted."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see that his "age, maturity level, even mental illness had any significant impact on his actions."
A prosecutor read a statement by Mr Roy's mother Lynn Roy: "One day I don't exist so I don't grieve for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I've overcome everything, and I'm trying to be there for his sisters with all the pain we're going to carry forever."
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that his reality, which he could never attend his brother's wedding or that he could never be to his children, "has not come out of his mind."
He said, "It's a pain that you've been with every day since I was born and that you don't have that person anymore and that you'll always be with me for the rest of my life."
It looks like it's gonna create a lawsuit because there's no Massachusetts law that's accusing a person of committing suicide.
Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead in a vehicle in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning.
The case attracted national attention when it revealed that Carter's text messages encouraged him to end his own life.
While he was on vacation with his family, she sent many of her messages two weeks before his death, saying, "Hang yourself, jump out of a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are a lot of ways."
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz instructed him not to be allowed to profit from this case through the press, saying Carter wanted attention through Mr Roy's death.
The case divided legal opinion.
Among the minority defending Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being cleared two years ago.
Mrs. Knox (30), published an article in the Los Angeles Times that said in a contrary opinion: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail."
Estimated dramatic growth by Mehmet Simsek
In Turkey, inflation should fall to low single digits, he said, and food inflation constitutes a "risk area".
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation will drop below 7 per cent in 2018.
In his speech, Lightning said:
The next 12 months are critical in the decline of uncertainty.
The greatest incentive is to reduce ambiguities.
There's a strong government.
No political ambiguity.
Hopefully, the ambiguities in our nearby geography will also decrease.
By increasing our resistance to shocks with some reform, I believe we can put Turkey on a growth trend of over 5 per cent.
I told you months ago.
Because the worst is over.
Gradually, not to those who take our energy anymore, but to the reforms that will allow our energy to grow inclusive, to increase employment...
That's why the next 12 months are critical.
On the one hand, reform, on the other hand, uncertainty is waning, there is no political ambiguity.
Hopefully we'll get lucky and less of the trouble in our nearby geography.
Many of our classic markets have collapsed whether we like it or not.
Libya, like Iraq.
We're not just losing Sunday, we're dealing with over 3.5 million migration waves.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown 5.7 percent despite all the shocks.
Turkey, I mean, we have our foundations, we have our problems.
Now, with some reform, we can increase our resistance to shocks, and a little bit more to address the question marks in investors' heads, putting Turkey back on a growth policy of over 5 per cent.
I'll tell you the truth, from here on out, we have such a generous pension system.
I think it would be reasonable to say that our retirement companies are not trying hard enough.
First of all, performance in auto attendance will be strong.
Why?
Because we took precautions.
The firms don't have to go and make an effort and make an effort.
We've been working on how to devote global assets to what investment areas, looking out for these concerns, taking into account the poor performance.
You know, the deposits are high.
Once again, there will be a performance there in addition to the 25 per cent given by the state.
And the rest of it is on the treasure paper, where the risk is usually low.
When we look at the big picture, I think there's going to be a lot of attention in the coming period.
Because they'll see the performance.
It's not a failure in the other field, it's a success.
We restructured BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, 70 billion dollars in savings.
You've got to hand it to him. The system's a success.
There are also 2.6 million participants in automatic participation, and $775 million in savings.
We want a little more effort from the firms.
Let them do some publicity, tell us about this system.
We're working on the layover.
Maybe if we stretch him a little bit...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe the citizens will see the revenue, see the accumulation, and stay in the system.
What's left of the system is 38 percent.
Almost half of those who have left are those with voluntary individual pensions.
You don't want two individual retirement accounts.
What are you doing?
You're out of the auto pool.
We were actually expecting a retraction around 10 percent.
Which means we were very optimistic there.
The system works once.
We brought a prime ceiling.
Insurance companies sometimes explain one-sided things.
They've increased their premiums too fast.
When we asked them what was going on, they said they didn't consider the current regulations.
We've just made a clear arrangement.
And we said, "Do what you have to do."
They said no, we'll wait for judgment.
And we said that's not how it works.
We have a difference of opinion here.
And then, of course, when this ceiling went into premium practice, some firms took care of it.
We've made a new arrangement.
We've created a pool of risky insurance.
I'll tell you this, let me repeat it.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
I mean, I don't think these ceiling price apps are right, they made us do it.
I want us to look at this in three dimensions.
Consider the system we've built.
Two, let the system function normally, a pricing on that trail.
In addition to that, their load is heavy, almost $30 to $31 of every $100 premium paid goes to tax SGK cuts.
I'm working too, so we'll talk to our finance minister.
Thirdly, technology is improving rapidly.
Now, with time, traffic accidents will also be severely reduced.
But this is mandatory traffic insurance.
SABAH's headline saved his leg
Buerger's disease, which emerged from puberty, was formerly a disorder seen in men, but is now becoming common in women as well.
One of these women is 36-year-old Moon Stop.
Her pain, which started two years ago, became chronic at the foot.
When the young woman, who had difficulty walking, was at risk of losing her leg, the hospital wandered around the hospital.
A friend of his suggested Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
He showed the story of 'Azerbaycan Secretary of Extraordinary', headlined in SABAH, who saved his life.
It was then revealed that Dursun, who had gone to Kalko, had been battling Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko has taken the young woman into emergency surgery.
Shortly after, Dursun recovers from his pain, and is now undergoing oxygen treatment.
Audi to Modify 850,000 Diesel Tools While Automakers Are Facing Reverse Response
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades in over 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of the BMW board, including Munich, where BMW's headquarters (thought of banning or limiting diesel vehicles), said the firm believes that "there are smarter options than driving limits."
Daimler said on Tuesday that he would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to lower diesel emissions.
None of the firms described these moves as recalls.
European car manufacturers had heavily encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are considered cancer-making and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment automotive companies need to wear to neutralize the dirty smoke generated by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult for the price of cars to remain competitive.
While German automakers were facing reviews, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government was also accused of spoiling powerful automobile companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The firms are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, which conceal that he used the device known as the misleading device and adjust emissions to fit the regulations at the time of a car testing and loosen it in normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives were charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in the Audi engine development department, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former principal Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore not protected against extradition and may be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi had been dragged into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen; authorities had expanded the United States-based investigation after accusing Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may be heavy to Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer has an excessive share in Volkswagen's profits.
Don't jump at everything you see
Turkish Neurosurgical Association President Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar has issued a warning not to jump from 6 feet (2 m) to shallow places.
Every year, thousands risk paralysis due to a neck fracture and spinal cord damage due to diving in shallow waters.
Neck fractures most frequently develop in the 5th or 6th vertebrae.
The feature of the fractures is that at this level it affects the muscles of the arms and legs, as well as the nerves that feed the respiratory muscles.
Prof. Dr. Ages said, "In accidents like this, our most valuable organ, the neck spinal cord, is cut off by the broken spine or is compressed out of function."
"The wrong first aid in spinal injuries not only increases damage to survivors but can also cause death," he said.
Diving in the water is fourth in spinal cord injuries.
The average age of the injured is 20-29 and the majority are male.
Prof. Dr. Ages, "Shouldn't jump into the invisible water."
He said, "No matter how well he dives, there could be a severe injury."
Prof. Dr. Ages also reminded me:
Depending on the level of spinal cord where the damage caused the injury while diving, there may be various degrees of paralysis in the arms and legs.
You may know how to swim, but water can be deceiving.
The place that looks deep to you may be shallow.
In the United States and Australia, warning signs placed on the seashore saw a 70 per cent reduction in cases of shallow water jumping.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar said, "Although 28 provinces are on the seashore in Turkey, there is unfortunately not a single warning sign in places outside Istanbul."
"Every pre-summer province needs to be kept noticeably under its health directorship, schools and social awareness project on beaches and pools, or information boards should be kept in relation to such life-deterred accidents," he said.
Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, the head of the Turkish Neurosurgical Association Spinal and Peripheric Neurosurgery Group, suggested that the following be done in case of injury:
112 calls must be made at the time of the incident.
The neck must be held as steady as possible, not moved, determined by a hard collar.
The airway must be supplied and the patient must be deposited upside down for drainage of the water that escapes to the lung.
It shouldn't be held by the legs and hung down to drain the water.
The disfigurement of the patient's neck should not be attempted.
Could be a broken cervical vertebrae.
However, if the spinal cord has not yet been damaged, first aid and an inappropriate position to be given to the neck during the transport of the patient may cause broken bone fragments to compress and sever the spinal cord.
Provence lavender under threat of climate change
It had become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it was under threat of climate change.
Lavender suffers from drought-like conditions and declines due to disease - bearing insects, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "The lavender in Provence has been effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in spring and mostly in autumn.
This affects the life of the lavender.
There's also a small cicada with a leaf pest that transfers microbacterium, and there's more of them in very dry air."
And a lot of things are at stake.
As much perfume and cosmetics as it attracts vacationers, there's a lot of lavender oil to be pursued.
Eric Chaisse said: "With a few large flowers we should have very long plant ears, while we have smaller, less developed, or weak ears.
So we have less essential fat parts."
Reviewed solutions include better distribution of water and slowing evaporation from the soil, but spraying a protective mixture of slime and water on plants and developing more resistant species to dry conditions.
Journalist's murder underlines growing threat in Mexico
The weekly newspaper Riodoce's staff usually meets on Wednesdays to review the latest upheaval by organized crime in the state of Sinaloa, corruption officers and plans for endless drug wars to be included in the paper.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they met to discuss their safety.
They were told it was important that they change their routine.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: bringing their children with them to the office, the target of a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column; no evidence is needed, perceptions and inner voices are sufficient.
Journalists suspected of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, government, or cartels, making the chaos of Mexico a list of bad guys who make it dangerous to write in the paper.
There are no breaks in violence, while the number of bodies nationwide is increasing, more than that are journalists: According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, there are at least 25 people since President Enrique Pena Nieto took over in December 2012; after attacks and threats, 589 are under federal protection and at least seven have died in seven states so far this year.
Recent fatalities include editors and inspirations Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez writes in one of his many books on narcotics violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is hanging everywhere on the front of Riodoce's building with the word "Justice", a large photograph showing Valdez's middle finger; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smile, his glasses face, and his Panama hat, which is his trademark.
The workshop takes place two months before his death; reporters talk about their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecution was created to handle journalist cases in 2010, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, he prosecuted only two.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists' killers are rarely brought before the law.
In Riodoce; although their hearts are broken, they insist on addressing the violence in Sinaloa, although the ground is now more deceptive.
Without information about murderers, without justice, it's very little use to discuss security, says Ibarra.
"It's stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left his Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital.
His red Toyota Corolla was able to drive only a few blocks before being stopped by two men; he was forced out of his vehicle and shot 12 times, for the name of his newspaper, which was probably translated as the Twelfth River.
The gunman got in his car and drove away and crashed the car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children left.
Rumors in Culiacan tend to roam freely.
But there's almost nothing but silence about Valdez.
After Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, while rival groups fought to fill the gap, Sinaloa became one of the nation's bloodiest battlefields.
Never mind the shooting and killing of one or many people on the street in Sinaloa, or the cemetery's drug kings being filled with fancy, two-story, much bigger mausoleums than many homes for living.
For a minute, forget the "consolance" situation where only one cartel controls valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this and being deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, was destroyed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two errors contributed to the murder.
First, in a February broadcast, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of Guzman's rival cartel groups at war with his sons.
This article may have angered the sons; possible gang members purchased every copy of the raid as soon as it was distributed to the newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper containing the same story was confiscated.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican-based violence against journalists.
He had survived too long, his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste in 2013 when he joined five colleagues selling $50 shares in the revelation of Riodoce.
"It was impossible to be a journalist without addressing the issue of narcotics," Bojorquez said in Sinaloa.
Over time, the newspaper became famous for its brave and honest news, and advertising increased with sales.
Reporters loved publishing vital research without fear of censorship, and readers were caught up in a publication where they could read stories that no one dared to communicate.
Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for reporting in Latin America eight years after its creation.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for having the courage to pursue the Mexican drug story no matter where it leads.
He admitted he was obviously scared.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to keep living."
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said drug trafficking in Sinaloa was "a way of life".
"As a journalist, you must accept your duty to play this or the fool.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?'
Riodoce staff miss Valdez; the joker who swears like a porter, his friends who are generous in his embrace and advice, his teachers who know how to survive...
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go across from the office to this bar called El Guayabo, and he used to sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Is his love for his routine his downfall?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions as to how they would do their best and survive.
"If you deal with their women, their children, their clean jobs, the secret plane runways they use to transport drugs, they don't like it."
"These things were crossing the line," Bojorquez said.
The result was a high-grade autosounding and self-preservation even at the best possible time.
Trusting your own instincts.
If something smells bad, stay away.
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, "The smell is a sense that can be deceived... and what happened to Javier has happened."
He and others say that old rules do not apply in Sinaloa; as does not apply in the same states as Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other countries that host profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials, a toxic mix...
The floor keeps changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff meets for safety training, no cell phones are allowed; days ago, it was revealed that spyware sold only to governments was used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers wanted to get rid of 104 degrees (40 Santigrat) temperature, in the shade of a tree.
They were allocated by the state government to protect Riodoce's office in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half serious, some of the reporters were wondering if these officers were part of the police within 50 percent of what the governor himself said was unreliable.
It's been months since reporters went to the mountainous countryside where drug gangs actually controlled it.
In this week's issue, Riodoce examines three main stories.
The murder of former great boxer Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, the governor had been exposed to government spending focused on his hometown.
And a block away from the D.A.'s office was the kidnapping of a group at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant.
There was no official explanation of who was kidnapped or how, so when it came time to write down what everyone in the city knew, caution prevailed: the restaurant was a favourite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the governing Corporate Revolutionary Party (PRI), who dominated almost every level of politics over the past century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about earlier events, including the escape of one of "El Chapo" Guzman's sons in a military raid at that scene.
Only months ago, they would read it, looking at Valdez's corner for information from the best source of the kidnapping.
Villareal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" due to its fine nature, said, "We already knew what was going on before."
"Right now, all communication channels with our sources have been cut off."
The staff is being reused as a warehouse for banners and stickers protesting journalist killings while turning activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed several banners and went on display the next morning for another journalist in the local prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was found, and according to DNA tests, the authorities say it's him.
Journalists across the country have expressed their thoughts louder by writing "aid the press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
Today, Director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to provide international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on reporters and having them killed for telling the truth.
From that day on, he wanted to be assigned to a mission other than doing government news, thinking that his anger had undermined his neutrality.
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "encircled" by organized crime, accomplice official officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, which he called "narko-journalism", he wrote that journalists were being killed not only by drug gangs, but by order of politicians and security forces who collaborated with organised crime.
Media observer group Articulo 19 linked most of the attacks on journalists last year to police and official officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The killings clearly had a cold shower effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in Tamaulipas, northern border state.
Her body was found along with a note said to have been signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and an earpiece, set next to his severed head.
Some publications such as El Norte opted to close after reporter Miroslava Breach was killed in March in the northern border state of Chihuahua.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after their principal was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed drug cartels with this editorial on his front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled from their own states, even the country.
It's a twisted decision.
It's hard to get a job in exile, and they're still combing the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after escaping Veracruz, they are captured as if they were from photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in an apartment building in Mexico City with four women in 2015.
It's a dance every day with these high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and continue to work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says that reporting the drug trade frightens him.
"Mexico is going to hell and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a Saturday in the recent past, while preparations for the final issue were being made, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, while their phones began to ring at the same time.
A series of armed clashes involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a beach resort, caused 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate, as promised in a series of cartel messages in the vicinity.
They put the story on Riodoce's website through cell phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
The sirens are starting to sing nearby, there's another gun in the area.
Bojorquez quickly glanced at the police officers on watch to see if they were alert.
Even if they were scared, they weren't showing it.
Under the enormous portrait of the defeated founders of his newspapers, his middle finger was on display for all Sinaloa to see, Riodoce's staff was following in his footsteps.
"How can you think about shutting it down," said Bojorquez, "The day Javier was killed, when the intern asked me to send her out on the street to do the story?"
He used camouflage to avoid dinosaur enemies.
It looks like a statue at first sight, but it's a horrible one.
Researchers explained that early findings of an incredible creature of rhino size now found by a Canadian miner were well preserved, with experts describing it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
It was so well preserved that they could see that the stamp skin was reddish brown and could say that it had a 'problem history'.
The report in Current Biology magazine described it as 'one of the best preserved armoured dinosaurs and one of the best dinosaur breeds in the world'.
Fossil is a newly found species of nodosaur that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago from the middle of the Cretaceous Period.
His extraordinary well-preserved condition baffled researchers who described him as 'really wonderful'.
The plant-eating armour is the best preserved fossil found in its own species, according to reports in National Geographic.
He was found digging up Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta Canada on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk.
He hit something that seemed strange compared to the rock around him and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
They spent the next 6 years uncovering the wild animal from inside the £2,500 (1100 kg) mound of land.
After such intense work, the completed result is now ready to be revealed.
Chief writer Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display, said, 'If you squint a little, you might even believe he's asleep.'
'As one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur species in the history of science, it will be referred to as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By examining her skin, researchers found that the plant eater was probably facing a serious threat from flesh-eating dinosaurs, although she was coated with armor and resembled a walking tank.
The dinosaur, highly armored, used its red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique used by many modern animals, known as contra-shadowing.
Experts suggest it was hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to blend in better and overcome its enemies.
The creature, 110 million-year-old nodosaur family, made headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now finished their work and named the wild animal Borealopelta markmitchelli, dedicated to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the team who spent more than 7,000 hours laboriously to uncover it.
The extraordinary preservation of the species made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists to document the shape and armor on the body with the pattern of the stamps.
They discovered contra shading, a common method of defense in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker on the bottom.
Although contra shading is common, the findings are surprising because Borealopelta's size exceeds the contra shading animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur is under enough pressure and hunted by flesh-eating dinosaurs, and evolution prefers to face hiding as a way of survival.
But the most contemporary animals using contra shading (e.g. deer, zebras, or armadillos) are much smaller and much more revealing to be a prey; that means that nodosaur faced a serious challenge to survive.
Brown said, 'Strong hunting applied to a giant, heavily armoured animal shows how dangerous dinosaur predators can be in the Cretaceous'.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues to its life, including preserved bowel contents, to find out what it ate at its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where it sank into the surface of the ocean on its back.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida is today, and probably rivers and oceans had spread further inland than they are now.
"Nodosaur is really notable for being completely covered and preserved with scaly skin, as well as the original shape of the animal being preserved in a 3D manner," Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it; if you squint a little, you might even believe he's asleep.'
The cretaceous was when giant theropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs on two legs, roamed the globe.
Although he was king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, who may have been hunted by a number of majestic ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 ft (11.5m) long, 6 tons weighing monster.
Scientists whose latest findings are in Current Biology magazine believe that Borealopolta was dragged into the sea after his death and embalmed in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk digging the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, this is the best preserved armored dinosaur, including leather and armor, and it's complete from nose to hip.
The creature averages around 18 ft. (five metres) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
He's got two 20-inch horns coming out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armoured herbivore wandered through what is now Western Canada, until it was dragged into the open sea by a flooded river.
But the dinosaur's tomb under the sea preserved his armor in perfect detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved, that the skin fragments still cover layers of moundd armor along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a conservative "is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at her, the more amazing it is.
Fossilized skin fragments still cover layers of moundd armor that are dot-to-tone on the dinosaur's skull.
His right front leg lies on his side, tilting five fingers upward.
I can count the scales on the soles of the foot."
When you want to bleach it, don't be your teeth.
White teeth and an aesthetic smile are every man's dream.
While people resort to various ways of whitening their teeth, Nukhet Berk, president of the Oral Laser Applications Association, warns that they should avoid products sold at the market or on the Internet.
"The bleaching of teeth can be provided by chemical substances applied by dentists or by fine porcelain surfaces that stick to the surface of teeth like nails on the surface of dentures," Nukhet Berk said, stating that such items sold are drawing the vervain surface, coloring the teeth so that there will be no recycling again.
Berk notes that maintaining dental health prevents many diseases from forming, and that aesthetic practices are important for mental health by providing both dental and dental health and a good laugh.
As long as there are no disorders or genetic factors in dental structures, young people's teeth are usually white.
Due to aging, drawing tooth enamels, and frequent consumption of cigarettes, corrosive or dark-colored beverages, the teeth receive darker colour over the years.
Whitening of teeth can be provided with chemicals applied by dentists or fine porcelain surfaces applied on the surface of teeth with minimal or no corrosion at all.
Never bleach teeth with products sold at the market or on the Internet.
Because these substances draw the vervain surface, and the teeth color so that they will never be recycled again.
The Municipality of Goatören is providing "The Dental and Mouth Health Service at Home" to elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens on this side from 2011.
Sixty-five-year-old Koksal Güngör, who has lived in Goatören's Awakening Neighborhood for 24 years, said, "My wife has heard of the service of Goatören Municipality."
We called the city, they came right away.
"I'm already paralyzed from the neck down, thanks to this service at least I don't neglect my dental care," he said.
Kezban Gökçe, a 72-year-old daughter of 95-year-old Gulizar Taşçıoğlu who lives in the Pinarbaşı neighborhood, said, "My mother has been addicted to bed for 7.5 years due to old age."
When I came to the city, I saw posters of this service, and I called right away.
We have been receiving this service regularly for four years.
I have a problem with my teeth, too, and when the doctors come, they look at me.
He used the phrase, "We're very pleased."
There is also no requirement for health care for services that are completely free.
Turkish military "management" incident
My dear readers, very interesting decisions have been made, especially for the Marine Corps, at the meeting of the High Military Shura (life) the previous day.
He was appointed a vice admiral, not an or Admiral, to command this Force.
It's an almost unprecedented practice in our army.
So how did this happen?
Force Commander Or Admiral Bülent Bostanoğlu has already expired, he was to retire...
And it happened.
Now it was time to take command of Veysel Kösele, the only admiral.
Veysel Pasha, who had been a victim of conspiracy in the past and had been imprisoned for some time, was supposed to be commander in the regular senior rankings.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm just trying to make it very clear that if we start at the top of the Marine Corps, No. 1, 3, 4 and 5 commanders were not promoted.
In that case, the Admiralty was the only one left in the Navy.
He was supposed to be brought to the vacated office: Admiral Veysel Kösele, Naval Commander number two.
And then what happened?
In sixth place, Vice Admiral Adnan Özbal was appointed by the government to that office.
Now look at this painting!
Admiral Veysel Kösele is standing there, but instead a lower-ranking commander is appointed!
A senior is being placed at your junior's disposal.
I wonder what happens next.
A admiral who excels in rank does not serve or do not serve under a lieutenant general who is inferior to him.
He doesn't take orders from her, he doesn't.
In that case, Veysel Kösele will not tolerate this hurtful situation, if he has not been retired, he will resign today or tomorrow.
That's the hurtful message given to him by the government: "Goodbye, Veysel Pasha!"
Yesterday, I wrote this article in the afternoons, and word had spread that he had resigned, but the situation had not yet been officially announced.
Let's look at this again!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele for one reason or another, did not want to, forced him to resign, and replaced him with a 6th-ranked coramiral and undermined our army's traditional sense of seniority.
There must be politics involved, but we don't know behind the scenes.
Maybe if someone tells us soon, we'll all find out!
My dear readers, I've tried to make it very brief upstairs, especially in the Turkish army, seniority is very important.
Not just as a rank.
For example, the officer who finished 10th in the War School is more senior than the 11th.
He is more senior to the general than to the first-place promotion, the second-placed promotion.
We've lived in Istiklal Harbin, a concrete example of this seniority.
The commander of the Garp Front, Ismet Pasha...
You have two armies at your disposal.
Army and 2nd Army.
It's 1922, our armies will carry out the great offensive and fire the Greek army.
At this stage, there are valuable names expected to be assigned to the military command.
One is Refet Pasha.
He is offered military command, but he says, "Ismet is junior to me, I can't get under his command."
Another name is Yakup Shevki (Subaşı) Pasha.
Atatürk's teacher at the Academy of War...
He's a valuable and senior commander who's been involved in various battles, where he loves it, cares about it, calls it "Master."
In 1919, he is captured along with soldiers and civilian Turkish intellectuals and driven to Malta by the British.
On his return home, he is reluctant and says the same things about military command: "The commander of the Western front is junior to me, I cannot take orders from him".
However, Atatürk convinces him of gratitude for the request, and Jacob Shevki Pasha accepts command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A soldier who talks too much, constantly criticizes.
A commander who fought on Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and various fronts.
He is also being exiled by the British to Malta, fleeing from there and coming to Ankara via Kuşadasi.
When he is offered military command, Ali Ihsan Pasha says the same thing: "I cannot fight under Ismet, who is junior to me."
But he's being persuaded...
But it turns out, after he takes office, he's constantly arguing with the commander of the Garp Front, Ismet Pasha, who he's under his command, making a scene and making the army restless...
And shortly before the major offensive, he is decommissioned and retired, replaced by Nurettin Pasha, the bearded.
Then Ali Ihsan Pasha never gets better with Atatürk.
The seniority issue in the Turkish military is not only prominent in war but also in peace.
Of course it has to come out.
Veysel Kösele is the last example of this.
How did an activist have to learn the answer to the question, "Who Are The Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
The day after he arrived to visit New York City, the native of St. Louis sat on the bed of Airbnb, which he had hired, and began to roam on Facebook on his phone.
It was a high school split.
"Police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street."
He was surprised when he realized that no one else had shared this information in the content stream, he turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A user named @TheePharoah was constantly tweeting in his content stream.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was tweeting Michael Brown's death live, 18-year-old, murdered by an unarmed black, white police officer in Ferguson Missouri.
He shared a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, which would remain there for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is brutal."
But death was nothing new to him or his people.
He left his phone to return to tweets about the gathering of people later that same evening on Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of police tapes, shouting people, and a man holding a banner that said, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!", claiming to be Brown's father.
He watched a live broadcast where a police officer was standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another cop, he said, set the trigger on his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembered saying, "'It's not usual.'"
"'This isn't the kind of murder we're used to, and it's not typical.'
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 a.m., he took his 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go with her to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson the next three years will come to the cinemas on 11 August, the subject of a new documentary entitled "Who's the Streets?"
This is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance from the point of view of the people who live in that society and fill the streets with the answers they seek.
While Ferrell was driving his vehicle to Ferguson with his daughter, who wore a flowery dress and wore a proper crown to him, they returned to talk about the "experiences of black people and the condition of black people" that they had done over and over again that morning.
He remembered saying, "Do you remember when I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe?"
"We are going to Ferguson now because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not true.
I couldn't not take it," Ferrell later said.
"What happened here today... is a consequence of what happened in the past.
He needs to know, see, and grow up in it.
Not only should it develop in the field of activism and organizing, but it also needs to know the layers of its black experience and its black state and its emancipation, it needs to know what we have to do to liberate ourselves.
If I'm lucky enough to give him an experience that he can't experience rude racism personally, he'll be no different than any black woman-child.
I get the feeling that by protecting him from these things, I'm going to be doing him harm."
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, which was across from the police station, where they expected to talk about the matter which later resulted in no criminal charges against officer Darren Wilson, which became a sort of campground for activists.
There Ferrell and his daughter contacted local business owners who prepared packed food.
They packed bags and helped deliver them to the protesters.
A new form of activism was gradually forming for Ferrell.
When he was a student at Missouri State University, he revealed that he was president of the Minority Students' Nurses Association and that he concentrated on injustice in food justice and health in the black community, saying, "My activism has completely changed after August 9th."
"I didn't have any experience with organizing.
It came on its own."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors at an evening screening.
Folayan said that he and his own cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "wanted to make things clear".
Ferrell came up with a question: "Do you want to document it or are you trying to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism had been reported by countless persons, often whites; to come to a society and profit from its pain and resistance...
As Folayan explained in a nearby interview: "We had heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson could not be concentrated, and we decided to do it differently."
Folayan had already made contact with the regional artist Damon Davis, known for his activism regarding prisoners who had been sentenced to death.
His participation warmed Ferrell to the project, as well as six other locals, as well as the team "Who's The Streets?" followed in the years after Brown was shot.
David said, "This documentary isn't someone talking to us or talking to us, it's us."
"That's what was essential to me, how to represent these people because that's how to represent me."
"The goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, but it shows that the move is not "about a masquerading leader, it's about society getting together," Folayan said, while he proved to be the most open of movie participants.
As a result, "Who the Streets?" surprisingly, he documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as his falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughing at his first view of the finished product.
"But when I was doing this and humanizing black people, I knew there could be some sensitivity."
Ferrell's story also cements and re-enters the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who derived the slogan #BlackLivesMatter on social media following the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin, identify themselves as gay.
"Black gay women in leadership generally kept the movement going," said Ferrell, "and this is because we are constantly at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to carry all the weight of it."
Folayan joined this, stating: "The movement is really being held up by black women and many gay black women."
Nevertheless, Ferrell insists that "there is nothing of the kind of action that is happening" and that he was not chosen because of his identities.
He says, "He's the one who triggered this energy."
"But it's not a coincidence that he's on the front lines, because as a black gay woman, there's a lot you can lose by living a life at these intersections.
You can feel his energy on the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras are long gone in Ferguson, but there are alarming racial connections between the community and the police.
Ferrell is under further surveillance for another 2.5 years due to shutting down the highway during a demonstration.
He defines the socio-political atmosphere in what he calls home as "complexity."
Still, Ferguson keeps track that he carved into his memory three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our job to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Kyrie Irving: The world isn't round, it's flat!
Speaking to NBC Sports, Irving said, "The world is not round."
The world is flat.
They get people used to these things by giving them fear.
Oh, man, don't ask too much.
Because the more information you crack, the more information comes out.
This is crazy.
Is the world flat?
Or does it revolve round itself in a circle?
I think you should look into it.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our faces.
They're lying to us!
Irving, "For years I believed what I wanted to believe."
I thought the world was round and round.
You really think we're going back in the solar system?
Nothing they send comes back.
He's not coming back!
The information they gave us is inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for the truth.
He said, "Do you understand what I'm saying?"
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, is struggling with 24.4 points and 5.9 assist averages for the Cleveland Cavaliers this season.
A Proper Similarity: The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, there are many white, black and brown faces hanging over the wires in the ceiling, each almost vaguely similar.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, with ear sticks and cut hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
As it is known, former intelligence analyst Manning, who served his 35-year sentence after leaking classified diplomatic messages via WikiLeaks website, sent his cut hair from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is called A Proper Similarity.
This is a product of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combined his discipline with his expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a trans-woman and a leading dissident whose three days of duty remain to be ended.
Dewey-Hagborg, who created 30 portraits by analyzing DNA algorithmicly extracted from Manning and using what a person with this gene data might look like, revealed not only the processingability of DNA data (there are many ways to be described, and the determinism from the essence of interpretations), but also with a firm, perhaps slightly cerebral interpretation of his identity.
Born Bradley Edward but more openly describing himself as a woman in puberty, Manning was convicted of 20 crimes in 2013, six of which were from the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
His image was pressured by the prison, so that there was only one photograph of him: a sandy, black and white selfie with Manning sitting in the driver's seat, which was visibly agitated, wearing a platinum yellow wig that was self-described to him.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was achieving success with the massive silence of his 2012 project Weirder Presumptions.
In this, the artist produced portraits by filtering DNA from the rashes of forensic pieces such as cigarette butts and gum to draw a picture of what these people might look like.
That's when he got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait that could accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the press preview of the new exhibition.
Meanwhile, the visit could not be made, nor could it be photographed, so they reached Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration made many exchanges of letters over the course of two years, becoming unexpected pen pals.
They even uncovered the suppressed Visions, a comic book illustrated by Shoili Lawgo, a book where the president pardoned Chelsea's punishment and imagined a future in which she could personally view the exhibition.
It was a kind of happy coincidence that Obama actually wanted Manning's release a few days after the book was released, which was good after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump finds new, tweetable ways to further fuel sharp divisions that are wanted to wage war on government leakers and transgender soldiers and repair them himself, there is also something deep and powerful about this exhibition that is now being opened.
When asked about the strange timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Events happen for a reason."
A written artist statement on the wall of the gallery, which Manning's huge signature, was below that (the point of the "i" in his surname was set with the heart), calling for an end to "auto-segregation" based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
Across the wall is his mitochondrial DNA sequence: many C's, G's and A's written in pencil...
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scholarly dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to tell us how amazingly similar we all are, at least as biological creation.
"What I hope people will get out of this is that our genome doesn't care how open we are to interpretation, how subjective the genetic genius is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work is on display of Imitational Memoirs.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, and that's 30 of them."
The last piece held in a single room is a page from the previously mentioned short comic book.
Here Manning, King Kong style, is shown leaving the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a loudspeaker in hand.
It says, "When they silence your conversation, they win."
"Don't ever shut up."
"This came directly from a letter to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition (as he had quite predicted from the comic book) but when he does, he will be greeted with masks, his own genetic imitations, which are collected like a group of protesters in the middle of the room.
Like everything else in the exhibition, the genetic haplogroups were made specifically up to Manning's height (5"2, Manning's height), written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits, "In the past I would have put them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd."
"I wanted this to be perceived as a mass movement, shaped with Chelsea, which is like the movement behind her liberation."
Northwestern educator and Oxford University employee Wanted for Murder
Police say a nationwide manhunt has been launched for a Northwestern University educator and Oxford University employee wanted as a suspect after a man was found stabbed to death on a luxury apartment floor in Chicago.
Cook administration district records show arrest warrants for first-degree murder were issued on Monday for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for alleged involvement in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Documents say Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27.
Officers received a phone call, reached Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with many deep cuts in his body.
Official sources said Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and that police were actively searching for the two suspects while detectives investigated stabbing as a murder.
Lathem has been a professor at Northwestern University since 2007 in microbiology and immunology.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was on administrative leave and that he was banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
"We are in contact with United Kingdom police and we are ready to help US investigative authorities in any way they need," said a spokesman from the University of University of Somerville in an email.
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi of the Chicago Police Department said he strongly encouraged suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to detect it are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities helped find suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a phone call from the building manager at Grand Plaza, who had just received a mysterious tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very scary.
Guglielmi also said it was unclear whether the incident was on July 27.
He said Lathem and Warren were confirmed by security cameras.
"We believe the victim had an affair with the student Latham," Guglielmi said.
The management staff at Grand Plaza issued a statement against residents saying: "Police are still working on the victim's timeline and background and are investigating a series of facts, a possible domestic incident."
Italy seizes German ship
Italian police announced yesterday that the ship Iuventa, which was in search-and-rescue activities in the Middle Mediterranean, had been seized on Lampedusa Island.
Police shared with journalists records of phone conversations he suggested belonged to two members of the organization announced that this operation was carried out as part of an investigation launched by Trapani Prosecutor’s Office in October 2016.
Jugend Rettet members, who have been suggested to have "also operated in favor of illegal immigration on the Libya-Italian line", have brought asylum seekers directly from the boats of Libyan human traffickers to Italy at least three times.
Jugend Rettet members questioned by the prosecution also allegedly committed this crime along with some members of the Libyan Coast Guard.
Following this, the organisation said they were assessing the charges against them, indicating that their priorities would continue to save human life.
In addition to ships under the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, some 9 international NGOs serve in the search and rescue of asylum seekers in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government had prepared a 13-point code of conduct for these organizations to comply and stipulated that it be signed.
Breaking news: 5 of Banli's kiosks that attacked the Greaterhen are sealed

According to Habertürk's report, several police and Riot Force teams accompanied the municipal teams.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete WADA road map in short term"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to become operational again.
"A specific phase has been completed in meeting road map criteria, with RUSADA obtaining the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
WADA road map updated in this context," said Mutko on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Regulation Compliance Road Map, which recently aired on the institution's website, describing the criteria that regulate the reworking of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, this does not involve anything that will concern Russia.
"Everything has been announced, all will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, a criterion mentioned on the list states that Russian anti-doping officials have to publicly accept the reported results of the state-sponsored doping investigation in the alleged Russian sport by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, approved by WADA.
Mutko referred to the issue, saying, "Our anti-doping system accepts a failure, while we conduct the investigation.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no government program, and we will not accept what did not exist."
Mutko's remarks echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, president of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to the Russian broadcaster RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged past problems in Russian anti-doping organs but added: "We have said at many opportunities that the report contains positions and regulations that create opposition.
No one is considering the report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended by WADA to conduct doping controls within Russia during the aftermath of the doping scandal in November 2005.
However, under international experts and the United Kingdom's anti-Doping (UKAD) supervision, this June test planning and coordination was allowed.
In July, following a visit to the institution's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli had announced that RUSADA was "going in the right direction" to become operational again.

The President of Galatasaray does not return empty-handed
Galatasaray former president Faruk Süren harshly criticized President Dursun Uzbek, who went to Bucharest and the capital Ankara for the Ndiaye transfer to convince Mircea Lucescu.
Here are the legendary president's special statements for SABAH readers:
Lucescu-Uzbek interview: "We were finishing when we left."
The President of Galatasaray does not go for nothing, nor does he return empty-handed.
Ndiaye transfer: The President of Galatasaray does not go to the footballer.
The football player comes to the president.
Of course they do, whether he kisses her hand or hugs her...
But whoever the player is, the president won't go for him.
You're giving 9 million euros to the player Ottomanspor got for 300,000 euros...
It's not 7.5 million, it's 9 million with bonuses!
You've already made a big investment, of course you will, and it'll be 7.5...
Uzbek's actions: I don't want to criticize.
But it's obvious.
G.Saray values are being erected.
It's not just football. It's all wrong.
It is the Court and the General Assembly that will change that.
But I understand the members are pleased!
Start-ups to help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure her employee happiness at the e-commerce start-up, but the polls weren't working.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or worse, deceptive.
Although he pledged anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company of 75 on hair care in San Francisco, says, "He never had consistency or objectivity."
So he called for help from the outside.
A new kind of human resources start-up emerges to allow companies to understand how their employees feel.
These allow firms to conduct quick-choice surveys by producing and licensing software whose specific purpose is to measure the busyness of employees, targeting specific teams and demographic groups, offering anonymous and complaining helplines to employees, and bypassing senior executives in some cases, and allowing employees to go to the board of directors to announce a disreputation.
The Redwood City start-up, which measures the busyness of employees by software analysis tools companies, Glint's co-founder and president Jim Barnett said, "There are now vehicles monitoring your health, such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company's Fitbit?"
Errett uses Glint to say that his employees understand better what he thinks and feels three years later.
In addition to presenting quick surveys and optional surveys to specific teams, it offers a heat map in which the company receives the most complaints and which director has low approval points; thus, the reasons for these can be tampered with.
In order not to become the next Uber, companies are beginning to understand that they need to know about the culture of workplaces; it has been in a scandal since Uber described a harassment environment in which those who explicitly say what they think are being punished in a blog post published by a former employee.
For start-ups like Glint, this request for surveillance means a very profitable business opportunity.
According to financial technology insights website Let's Talk Payments, the global management, regulation and compatibility industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
Interest and activity in Denver Colorado-based start-up Convercent, which helped companies detect and block bad behavior, increased among the debates of Uber's disreputation earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct personalized "neutral" polls, collect real-time secret responses, and map heat for troubled areas.
It also offers an anonymous messageable helpline where employees can report bad behavior.
If the president is charged, the complaints go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Covercent, said, "The public court has taken over regulators".
Quinlan said: If a company mistreats its employees or does not behave ethically, consumer boycotts may face costly consequences due to employee casualties or lawsuits, even if regulators do not step in.
With more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, the restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday has been using Convercent for more than a year to allow its employees to be aware of principles and procedures and to offer easy access to the company headquarters.
When a former employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a telephone number or email belonging to the company headquarters, making an official complaint and hoping it would be taken seriously.
James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's chief legal counsel, said that these were often intimidating and disturbing experiences, not a good way to pursue employee complaints.
But now that the company is using Convercent, problems hidden from managers who previously sat in office, city, or state distances (such as discrimination, harassment, or the practice of unfair pay) can be detected and solved faster.
Vitrano, who led Ruby Tuesday's risk management group, said, "I can get closer to this employment experience from a holistic, 360 degree perspective."
"We also protect our shareholders against business cases."
In 2002, after accounting firm Arthur Andersen went down due to a violation of ethical values caused by the Enron scandal, companies handled ethics, values and relationships with the employee more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after the "social media came to its senses", the firms realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from becoming viral.
"Before technology was used to oversee ethics, people were using hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and receive recurring fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors supporting both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and raised its total capital to $47 million.
Glint provided $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the nature, culture, and risk capital of companies that are interconnected.
Increased amounts of research show today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
High salaries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are only minimum requirements.
The employees want to feel accepted, valued, and given their time to a company with a positive mission.
LinkedIn's global benefits and working experience using both Convercent and Glint, Nina McQueen, vice president, said: "When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices being heard and their work is satisfied, they are more sincere to make that company successful."
Investors make a profit when their own portfolio companies do good work; companies do good work if their employees are sincere and feel they belong to the company.
If third-party analysis tools promise to increase employees' sincerity and feelings of belonging, it is no surprise that they have found support.
Having data on employee commitment is important to occupational culture experts.
But the data is useless if the company's responsible don't act.
In fact, if a company wants feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that change is coming.
And if the expectation doesn't come fast enough or it doesn't come at all, it can be disappointing and it can make the employees feel like they've been cut off.
Russell Raath, head of consulting at the business management firm Kotter International, who saw that firms made the mistake of relying too much on data collection, said, "If you want 4,000 proposals, you need to be ready to talk 4,000."
"Because if you don't follow, the employees will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And why should I care if you don't care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly employee surveys, was able to act on the same day when a problem was reported at Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were tired of the speed of decision-making and communication quality, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and added communication training to solve problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company receives new insights into its own employees and hopes that in the long run, it will be able to keep more workers in such an industry, known to be a high number of employee input exits.
Vitrona said, "If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you lose people."
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose companies."
It's a long day for the Bruins when the NCAA lifts two practices every day.
It's almost 11:00 a.m., and a crowd of UCLA football players are hanging out on one side of the team's new practice pitch on campus.
Some strip off their jerseys, revealing their sweaty backs from the trouble of the first day of training camp.
For a significant part of the team, these free minutes form a mid-day break.
After three hours of training, players enrolled in summer classes will return to their dorms and work on final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for the 6:30 a.m. meets the next morning.
Just before Bruins coach Jim Mora returned to Tuesday on Monday, he said: "A torment for these men for the next three days."
Arranged to lift the burden on the players, the NCAA's removal of two practices per day, at least until the finals were finished on Friday, actually extended their days.
Thus, UCLA's first three trainings were programmed to begin at 7:15 p.m., in order to adapt to players' already cramped schedule.
The reward for not having two practice per day is more once a day; the Bruins put the camp's start up closer to a week than last season, and during the summer school, Mora's first training in summer school during six seasons in Westwood.
They plan to train 18 by August 20 before they begin their formal match preparation for their opening against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said the NCAA supports the rule change, although players have added new pens to the busy working schedule.
Mora said, "For three or four days, we're putting a huge burden on them, and it's very challenging."
"And they've been through this recently; they're working, they're amazing kids.
I think we'll have more time when we get to Saturday, it'll be really great."
UCLA will stop their training when the camp is over; it is not easy when the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which is rained on by the parking lot next door and a football next door and closes the back of the castle with a protective net, is thought to lie in the line of view of their field.
The Bruins are scheduled to move into the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora admits that during the season, these rooms may be a problem.
"We'll have security," Mora said.
"It's a real concern, and it's not so crazy to think that someone would rent a room and sit there and film a practice.
If there's a video of a practice, that's a pretty good thing.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security upstairs at parking lot 8.
We'll do our best with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
Facebook boosts story verification power to fight fake news
Facebook third party sent more potential fake articles to story confirmers and will show their findings under the original sharing; this is how the world's largest online social network described its attempt to combat what it called fake news on Thursday.
In a statement on the firm website, the firm said they would use updated machine learning to detect possible frauds and send them to story verifiers, which would potentially show story verification results under the original article.
Facebook is criticised for being one of the main distribution points of news that knows as fake news that many think affected the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem also became a major political headline in Europe, with French voters flooding fake news before the presidential election in May, and Germany supporting the plan to cut penalties if they failed to quickly remove hate-filled posts to social media networks there before the elections in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new story verification feature is being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what stories are being discussed by third party story confirmers, people want more resources about what they read and share to make decisions based on information," said Sara Su, the Facebook news stream product manager on a blog.
He added that Facebook would continue to test its "interested article" feature and will work on other changes in the news stream to reduce false news.
Creating a comic book: The story of a Castle in England
In his recent past, Fort Scotney appeared in a squeeze music video and became a sanctuary for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But right now, Scotney, who inspired a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire, who had broom hair, a passion for historical documents, witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent.
"I find it very nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years."
"What a personal bond it is to hold this letter in my hand."
A Castle in England extending from the Edwardian era to the Middle Ages, each story documents families who lived in Scotney to be illustrated by a different artist (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg), mentioned from the United Kingdom.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he also wrote Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories in 2014, a project he unexpectedly found emotional, inspired by stories in the British Library.
"Even the fingerprint on the edge of a letter written by a double agent working for King James supporters in the 1700s has brought tears to my eyes," he says.
"This was the mark of his thumb!
And the letters always smell of work because at the time you used to light a fire for the light.
For someone 300 years in the future, that smell feels like it's there.
Oh, I love archives!"
As someone in love with old papers, it seems too good to get support from the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and be able to stay in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I've overstepped my welcome by staying too warm for too long.")
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" fort, scanning archives, and studying many treasures and antiques, such as hyena heads mounted on the walls of the manor and bottles spent centuries in ditches.
He travelled through the lands and ruins of the old castle, speaking to rangers, gardeners, and artists who sometimes worked on illustrations of his book.
And then at night, he'd drink whiskey and start writing.
Since the National Trust could only reach full access when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006, Scotney's detailed history is relatively unknown.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only begun to address the archive, which he described as: "For centuries the aristocrats were saying: 'Oh, throw it into the attic'."
The journals, letters from the days of the British empire, maps that set the boundaries of who has what: "You think the land disputes will be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch tree over which the two families had been fighting over.
Forget it, guys!"
Some stories in the collection, including The Labourer, who left the newly built castle to join the Peasant Rebellion in 1381, use the castle as a jumping point to make a wider entrance into British history.
"In this book, Knight Families of Kent and Sussex, there is a record of rebellion in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The Village Rebellion started around here, and I thought a rebellion could be a good starting point.
Maybe these two are connected?"
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the English Islams.
Or The Smuggler, featuring 18th-century smuggler Arthut Darrell, who is thought to have filled a coffin with stones and staged his own funeral (an exposé made years later when his coffin was exhumed).
The Darrells Rhodes' favorite Scotney family: "These gentlemen seemed to be quite tricky, always going into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men solved debt crises by marrying wealthy older women; I imagine them to be a group of handsome men who are capable of courting female heirs."
Rhodes, whose mission at the castle is over, is in search of other singular writing experiences.
In Finnish wildlife, he completed a two-week job for a comic book about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, which has since been repossessed by nature.
But Scotney has a place in his heart.
He says, "I was sorry I left."
"It's like: 'Oh, now I have to go and face his fucking real life.'"
'Maho' response to Meral Akshener
Nationalist Movement Party Secretary İsmet Büyükataman has made a written statement regarding allegations of resignation in recent days in social media and media related to the MHP.
Greatataman used social media and the expression "kindle flowing" to the MHP from the corners of "some former rifle Marxists", suggesting that "games and stalls were applied to prevent the country movement from continuing to exist under the MHP roof after 12 September".
Grandmadaman said:
"He rubs his hands if he can't stomach the historical existence of the Turkish nation, can't pull the Turk's homeland, however many records are broken, criminal files are puffed up, his idea is fuzzy, his mind is confused."
"Now they're out, "410 people and members of MHP Kocaeli Gölcük County Agency and 215 resign in Newehir district of MHP Bursa".
The public is misled by unfounded reports such as 250 resignations, 300 resignations.
In newspaper columns, lies have grown enormous, deception has deepened.
As there is no resignation that has reached us in this issue, the number of clients mentioned in the places does not exceed the fingers of one hand.
Describing the resignations as "so-called", Grandataman again said that public opinion was trying to be misled and manage perception by polls he referred to as "so-called".
"These's propaganda and campaigns to create perception against the MHP will backfire," said Grandataman.
MHP Secretary General Büyükataman, who said MHP is an important and indispensable actor of Turkish politics, said of the resignations:
The old Marxists can't afford to destroy the place the MHP acquired on the conscience of the Turkish nation.
A dirty account lies behind all comments made, methods of perceptual management applied.
Because politics and media are staring at the MHP base.
It makes no sense to us that those who do not work and strive for our party's benefit while they are among us now resign.
What's the big deal about those who can't take advantage of our party?
The people who have never done good to the MHP in their lives, who have not shared our memories, who have not understood our ideals, who have not participated in our struggle, who have always stood on the sidelines, whose mindset has been charred, whose heart has been stoned must find themselves another busy.
The efforts of those who cannot attract the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party, the efforts to stir up turmoil, the search for debate and faction, are futile efforts.
And he'll turn around and shoot his owner.
The Nationalist Movement is the last standing stronghold of the Turkish nation despite heavy destruction.
In his statement, "The nationalist movement is not unclaimed," said Buyanaman, who said "politic counterfeiters", "political snatchers" for those he claims to be targeting the MHP."
"The outer altars inside, which feed from beyond the ocean, will not achieve their objective, regardless of the cost," he said.
Using the phrase, "Traded traitors will return to madness and burn to ashes in fire", MHP's Büyanaman said in his statement that they will not be able to operate on the Turkish nation's right to claim its own destiny, by listing opposition parties and terrorist organizations together. "From there to the CHP to the HDP; from there to the Perinchancians, from the PKK to the FETÖ."
Yesterday we resisted the new tactics and games of MHP-free MHP, MHP-free Turkey planners; we fought to the end with the MHP-free government, the Parliament-free bastards who wanted the MHP.
Now we're gonna break the game, we're gonna ruin the players.
"The patent of country is in the MHP," Büyanaman said, implying Meral Akshener: "It is obvious that the resignations of the man they follow will say, "I will take Maho villagers to Germany, as in the film Banker Bilo, which is an ancient Green-language film, after walking them through a truck vault for days, leave you on a mountainside of Istanbul, and leave you on the edge of the cliff."
It's their business, but all we want from these patrons is for them to be new to where they're going.
Kjaer signed for Sevilla
Kjaer, who was transferred to Sevilla at a price of 12.5m euros from the yellow-blue team and made history as the most expensive defence transfer of the Spanish team, signed the official contract.
The Danish star will wear number four in Sevilla.
Great ease from THY to families with babies
The national airline, which precipitates the flight comfort and satisfaction of its passengers and works to make them feel more comfortable throughout the flight, continues to develop new ideas for an excellent travel experience, according to the THY Press Advisory.
In this direction, the "baby travel kit", prepared by study of the needs of infants and their families between 0 and 2, began to be offered to baby passengers travelling on intercontinental flights from August.
The kit, prepared with a specially designed bag, includes a diaper, a disposable food apron, cooking cream, baby lotion and shampoo, a newborn wet cotton wipe, and a breast pad.
Paraben, Alcohol, products that did not contain harmful chemicals with paint, were produced considering the sensitivity of baby skin.
Washington Changes Green Card Rules
According to media, President Donald Trump said there would be a new U.S. immigration plan that changes Green Card rules.
It envisions dropping legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for temporary work permits, and restrictions for visas for the family.
The new rules were offered by Republicans and were also supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed on both sides of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase salaries and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the United States gives Green Cards to other country citizens.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates, self-sufficient financial resources and those with abilities to help our economy," the American media quoted Trump as saying.
Authors commented on Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
For two seasons, Kadýköy had regained the joy and glory I could not see.
A "moldhearted" team made by Aykut Big in his absence was on the field to make a "stand behind us" deal with his fan.
We can criticize your game, your positions, your performances, but I haven't seen a game like this work and call in a long time.
He made it clear in the first game, but yesterday he put his epaulettes on his shoulder; Fenerbahçe's commander in the field is now Valbuena.
His age had been a problem when he was transferred, but there was a phrase in Big's words, "the character who never gives up."
30 years ago, we gave the name of the atomic ant to Reza Çimbay.
If he manages, it'll be the most appropriate comment for the French player.
He was all over the field, joining all the pass organizations, always taking responsibility and scoring a goal, putting on a huge show.
Alper's playing ahead, his second striker position left the Sturm Graz team "short" in his field for a long time.
Fenerbahçe kept looking for formulas to break through such a hard wall as he shut down the circuit before he could corner it.
They dominate the ball, but they can't produce effective rust in the rival penalty area.
This footage might be a "need a centrfor" comment, but we're looking at a game that hesitates to pass to Ahmethan, unable to put the only centrfor in position.
Either the team did not trust the young player, or his performance needs to improve a little bit more.
After the score became 1-1, they failed to take advantage of two clear opportunities.
It was important that they cross the tour, but it would make the night even more beautiful to raise this fan, "gol", who applauded the players' struggle standing up.
There'll probably be a couple more transfers by Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbahçe needs number 12...
We're on the verge of a very bright and enjoyable season with this game style that carries the hearts of those in the stands who try to play in the front.
Aykut Huge's machine is setting up its beam, it needs more time.
They're in good shape as a physical quality.
The quality of the game will also improve.
You can also see that all the players in the field have increased confidence.
They need a lot of applause for a new page last night.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried.
Just when you think 2017 can't get any weirder, there's a new report on technological advances in the sex robot industry.
Yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Agency (FRRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we should take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape, and nail type.
Mr Sharkey said of the release of the new report, "People are laughing at them, but the firms are actually sending a lot of shipments, and we're going to see them even more."
Modern sex babies evolved into robots with responses, especially human, performed by artificial intelligence, with silicon skin, which is warm to touch from inflatable counterparts.
Users can also personalize their robot to match their own blood by selecting everything from the robot's eye color to the nipple shape and nail type or color.
But with many robots having "personalities" enough to make a Stepford Woman look innovative, it becomes even more disturbing.
Modern sex babies evolved into silicone-skinned robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to personalize their own robots according to their character characteristics (e.g. shyness) in which they find them attractive.
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, which give the impression of shyness, including "Frijit Farrah" and "Wild Wendy" with his "adventurer" personality.
True Companion's website is stirring: "Roxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as well as possible."
I mean, whatever you love, whatever you don't love, etc.
They also have moods during the day, just like real people.
He can be sleepy, willing to talk, or "right in the mood."
There are many disturbing aspects about the rise of sex robots: not just the replacement of real human relationships, but the highly obedient female personality traits, the rapeous connotations as they approach Frijit Farah are the most suggestive.
On his website, True Companion compares Roxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If she can have a vibrator just like that in the text, why can't men have Roxxxy?" website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex through subjugation, an optional attachment.
Many men will not naturally have sex robots, and the FRR points out their growing popularity, but they are now located in the outer edges of consumer culture.
But those who leak through the ends can be highly instructive about the course of our time.
Many people are not strange or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
It's not a coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots, with a president bragging about sexually assaulting women in the White House, appeared at a time when women's rights were under threat worldwide.
The creepiest thing about The Handmaid's Tale TV series is not the depictions that show all the details, not the nooseed bodies or the carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn’t feel like such a big change at the moment.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as many physical similarities as possible to real women (of course, in the proportions of porn film stars) as possible technologically.
Their creators want them to feel human when they touch them, and they want them to mimic the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personality," robots clearly cannot represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
They have no activities or past stories, nothing that would expose their independence or disrupt the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they are pleasurable slaves.
Or as they call it in 2017: concubines.
Attack on U.S. military convoy: dead and wounded...
The suicide attack in Karabakh district, Kabul, Afghanistan, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
It was announced that 5 of the injured were American soldiers in the convoy and 1 of the injured were interpreters with NATO forces in the explosion, which killed 1 NATO soldier and 3 civilians.
NATO support forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support) said the NATO forces detonated the suicide bomber's homemade explosive during a joint patrol mission with the Afghan National Army.
It was announced that injured personnel were being treated at Bagram Airport American Military Hospital.
There's no danger of life for the wounded.
Local media reports that the suicide bomber was a member of the Taliban.
Trump's great talent?
Make Mitt Romney look like a common sense.
The political division that polarized U.S. voters divided families on a microscale was the reality of the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the United States were filled with how to deal with the nightmare of relatives voting for Trump.
We're all trying to blow up our so-called filtering bubbles.
Less talked about Trump's power to bring families together.
I'm referring to this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has a relationship with the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
It reminded me that a merger against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone he's known, including his Republican brother, whom he's been arguing about for decades, is on the same side, suddenly and strangely.
At the dinner table, of course, it's a good thing, but it seems to me that in a wide context, it carries significant risks.
The left was played by Trump, but the bending effect of his presidency created the power to push to the right for the whole.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we talk about the terrible possibility that one day his strange behavior may no longer shock.
In fact, there's an even scarier long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who oppose their own standards, and all of a sudden they seem to be a symbol of reason.
I find myself experiencing nostalgia for the bizarre version of Mitt Romney's madness these days: the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like), both of which are very light crimes according to Trump.
When Trump leaves, he just needs to be sane to be assessed that the next Republican candidate is providing an unmeasurable degree of development.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel run by the New York Parks Department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are enormously large, fiberglass designs in the central cylinder (all of them clowns and animals who make strange faces turned to look scared behind their own shoulders) and the tinkling music is oddly exciting.
In other words, many stereotypes of a city can be disappointing: the landscapes of high buildings begin to seem boring, the horizon becomes too familiar to create much excitement, and the reality of the city does not reach the dream.
It's been thirty-five years, and I still haven't completely overcome the day I discovered that Swiss Cottage was a wide roundabout in North London, rather than actually a Swiss country house (not counting the hot bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage).
However, the merry-go-round in Central Park is still a strangely magical experience, so that two people at two, an 11-year-old, and two women in their 40s can go here and they can all have a very good time.
If I could grade the merry-go-round, I'd give him a full grade, but thank God no one asked.
On the other hand, before I passed my credit card at a bonus this week, I was asked to evaluate the process "experimentation" between one and five stars.
It's the same thing at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and the option to match the note to a 15% tip for what was bought at the counter...
The effect of this is not only that it slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also that it pressures the server to give personality to an event that is not needed at all.
While the poor woman at the market was standing there smiling like she was sorry, I, who was bored, gave her five stars to give her credit cards.
They wore bathing suits after the temperature was 41 degrees.
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season, the people flocked to Munzur beaches.
As early as noon began, the hots were well pressed, the young, young, old, women and men, who entered the beaches near Munzur Tea, tried to avoid the heat by cooling off in the icy waters.
Beaches on the edge of Munzur Tea were flooded, especially because Tunceli citizens living in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and England spent their holidays in their homeland instead of the Aegean or the Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, among those who cooled off on Munzur Beach, stated that he used his preference for Tunceli instead of the western provinces for the holiday, "I didn't want to spend my vacation in the west, it was more right to cool off in Munzur as a family, to stay on our own land."
"Munzur's icy water is nowhere in the world, Munzur cools us down at these temperatures," he said.
Hasan Ulu, who came from Germany, said they preferred the Munzur Tea coast in Tunceli rather than the Fountain or Bodrum beaches, and that they did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital to treat the lacerations on his wrists, which prison officials said occurred after he fell in his cell.
Pistorius had been convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors to the previous accidental murder verdict.
Early in Valentine's Day 2013, he killed Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria, shooting repeatedly towards a toilet booth door.
Pistorius had claimed that he had mistaken his girlfriend for someone who broke in at night, who was hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced that they intend to appeal once again against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they consider to be too light this time.
The National Prosecution Mercii said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be assessed this year.
Pistorius will face a 15-year sentence if prosecutors succeed.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
The first pilgrimage caravan was sent off.
The pilgrim candidates for Saudi Arabia with the organization of the Religious Affairs Presidency were sent off with prayers and tears at the Ataturk Airport Outlines Departure Terminal.
Prior to the movement of the first pilgrimage caravan, the ceremony at the Outlines Terminal was attended by some 200 pilgrim candidates, as well as relatives and citizens.
Meanwhile, Turkish Airlines (THY) issued roses to pilgrim candidates on a scheduled plane to the holy land.
The Hajj caravan in Ankara was sent off from Esanboğa.
The caravan also included martyrs and veterans relatives who took advantage of the practice of the first-ever "gazis and non-gathering pilgrimage for their martyr relatives" this year.
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Camping
According to the State Department's statement and quoted by bTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on the grounds of illegal camping.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police on the morning of August 1st in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day while the investigation was underway.
The foreign ministry informed bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened their control over free camping and are still giving serious penalties to those caught resting in undivided locations for that purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could fine.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOEY Hoffman (22) travelled to Turkey with two friends in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who traveled Adana and Mersin in their rental vehicle, disappeared in Silifke on 8 July.
His friends, who he had come with, failed to reach Hoffman despite all the calls, informed his family in the Netherlands.
Police were also on the move to find the missing tourist, while his brother Robin Hoffman and friends Angelo Durei and Jaimy Gewald went to Adana.
LANDS DROPED IN BASSIRIP
Robin Hoffman, who applied to the police here, printed the missing flyers for the discovery of his brother, distributing them in Adana and Mersin.
Robin Hoffman stated the last time they heard from her brother was on July 8, saying, "We first appealed to the police in the Netherlands."
Then my two friends and I came to Turkey and applied to the police here.
So far, we haven't heard anything, and we haven't found any clues.
"Until my brother is found, we will stay in Turkey until news is heard," he said.
Congratulations to World Second Minister Sophia Ceren
At the 2017 Paletized Swimming Junior World Championships in Russia, national athlete Ayşe Ceren Greenhead was second in the world over 400 metres of water.
Youth and Sports Minister Osman Love Bak congratulated the silver medalist Ayşe Ceren Greenhead with his message.
On the first day of the 2017 Palet Swimming Junior World Championships in Russia, Ceren Greenhead was the world's second above 400 metres of water.
Ceren missed the gold medal with only 27 saises as he took his place on the second bench with his magnificent performance on the course where he competed with eight finalists.
At 400 metres, Elena Lopatina of Russia won the gold medal with a time of 03.18.73 minutes, while Ceren won the silver medal with a time of 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by eight men and eight women athletes in the championship.
His last words were, "I think I'm dying, goodbye, Mom."
Among those who have died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London so far, by calling his mother at the time of the fire, "I don't want to die, Mom, it's not fair."
"Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye" was announced as well as the Italian Gloria Trevisan and her lover.
Dozens of unreported people following the fire included 26-year-old Gloria Trevisan and her Italian lover Marco Gottardi, who lived on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, announced that both young people had lost their lives, according to information from British authorities.
Expressing that young people's families are suffering a great deal, he also asked reporters not to insist on getting an explanation.
I think I'm dying. Bye, Mom.
Attorney Sandri said that Gloria called her mother Emanuela Trevisan on her cell phone shortly after the fire broke out, and she cried herself when she heard these recent conversations recorded by her mother.
Accordingly, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times during the two hours after the fire, which began around 1:00 local time.
"Mom, something bad is happening here, there's been a fire."
We're stuck, we can't get out.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be rescued.
"We tried to get out by opening the door, but there was too much smoke and the elevator wasn't working either," it was said.
As the fire grew, his subsequent calls quoted Gloria Trevisan as saying:
Mom, my whole life is flashing before my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life ahead of me; it's not fair.
I don't want to die, and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't hold you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me. Goodbye, Mom.
I'm going to heaven now, and I'm going to help you from there.
It's the Italian government's fault.
Gloria Trevisan, both of whom studied architecture, and her lover Marco Gottardi, had found it difficult to find work after graduating last year, had moved from the Veneto region in the north of the country to London in March.
Gloria Trevisan, who was able to find a job in her country with a salary of only 300 euros, soon began working in London with a £1,800 per month (approximately 2060 euros).
Lawyer Sandri said that Gloria Trevisan's family was having a hard time financially, "Gloria had gone to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young ones are forced to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government must find a solution to this problem immediately," he said.
Italy's drama, unable to provide work for its young
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, also expressed his anger, "This is the fault of our government that forces our young people to flee abroad to find work."
The unemployment rate in Italy reaches 12 per cent, while the youth rate exceeds 40 per cent.
Upon increasing this problem, many Italian youths had begun to migrate to many European countries, especially Britain, over the past few years.
Only last year, there were 110,000 young people who had to leave Italy because of unemployment.
On the finalisation of news of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi's deaths, Italian media commented that this was the drama of a country that could not provide jobs for its young people.
Red meat, dairy and chocolate can ease IBH
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims otherwise: a rich diet of meat-based proteins and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms of those suffering from intestinal disease.
This incurable health condition, affecting 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and swelling, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Although patients were often advised to skip meat and dairy products to mitigate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein's main aminoacide triptophane helped develop immune cells that developed a durable intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, testified that immune cells patrol the intestines so that germs hidden in food would not sneak into the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that encourage endurance by maintaining sensitive tissues without harm.
If the balance shifts too much towards inflammation, the inflammation can result from intestinal disease.
Experiments found that a form of immune cell has emerged in mice carrying a specific bacteria in their intestines that promotes durability.
And the bacterium needs triptophane, one of the protein's building blocks, to trigger the cell's emergence.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have connected the bacterium species Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of the cell population that promotes durability.'
Rats with more triptophans in their diet had more of these immune cells.'
If the same thing is happening in humans, L. suggested that a diet rich in reuteri and triptophan could improve a more durable, less inflammatory bowel environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, while working on a form of immune cell that developed durability, discovered that a group of lab rats had such cells but not another group of the same species held in a different location.
He suspected that the difference was related to the rat's gut microbiomes, otherwise known as bacteria, viruses, and fungi communities that normally live in the stomach-intestinal canal.
There was a DNA sequence of the intestines of mice, and it was found to be missing in mice with immune cells, where there were six types of bacteria, but not those.
Because they were cared for in a sterile environment, rats who lacked a bowel microbioma and did not develop such an immune cell were given L. reuteri and immune cells emerged.
In order to understand how bacteria affected the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred it to immature immune cells taken from mice in small amounts of this fluid, which was unbacterized.
Immunity cells have become cells that promote endurance.
The active component turned out to be a byproduct of the triptophan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid when it was purified from the liquid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptophane in the mice' nutrients, the number of cells increased by around 50 percent, but when the levels of triptophan were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan expressed that humans have cells that promote the same resilience as rats, and that most of us have L. reuteri in the stomach-button duct.
Triptofan byproducts from L. reuteri are not known to develop as in mice, but disorders in genes related to triptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
"The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage because these cells control the inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially when L. reuteri is present, the high level of triptophan causes this population to spread."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United signed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
After midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic.
The £40 million transfer from Chelsea started with a 2–1 win in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup Tuesday in United's last preseason game against Real Madrid, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira eyed the position that held it in the forward offensive based on their tastes.
However, Matic, who had been left out on the Blues' preseason Asian tour, was severely short of match conditioning and was able to pull out only 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that this had to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his thinking genius... he's thinking about football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready sooner."
Mourinho began to shape his top 11 for the start of the season, while, like Matic, his new transfer mates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also played at Aviva Stadium.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more transfers but insisted that the club had already done "a remarkable job" by performing three of its four priority transfers.
"I thank the club for taking three of the four," he added.
"I'd be happier if they took four out of four, but they made a great effort for me."
197 people were sent to the hospital last year.
The diagnosis of gender dissatisfaction, which was placed on one person in a hundred thousand people in 2005, has increased to 8 per cent in 2015, according to the S.E.R. Social Welfare Agency data.
Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital was transferred to a majority of children and young 197 people who were displeased with the gender she was born in last year.
Louise Frisen, a child psychiatrist in the same hospital, stated that the increase could be due to her becoming an open society, saying, "The opening in the psycho-sexual field, which includes questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in society."
Gender dissatisfaction is known to have no connection to sexual orientation.
Drug operation in İzmir
The Bureau of Trafficking and Anti-Organised Crime teams of the Payed County Police Department have launched an operation on the home of 36-year-old F.T. in Körtr Street of September 3.
A search of the house recovered a sensitive scale with 33 extacy pills.
F.T., who tried not to jump off the balcony, was arrested and taken into custody.
It was recorded that F.T. would be transferred to the courthouse following its proceedings at the police station.
Transfer at Evkur New Malatyaspor
One of the Super League's new teams, Evkur New Malatyaspor, tied winger Turgut Born Hawk, who played for Kasimpaşa last season to their colors.
According to a statement from the yellow-black club, a two-year contract was signed with the 29-year-old winger as part of the transfer work.
"The two-year deal was reached with winger Turgut Born Hawk who played for Kasimpaşa.
Congratulations to our new Malatyaspor".
The British inventor used a hand gesture to chip himself into his house and his car.
A British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip in order to open his front door, access his office, and even start his car with just one hand.
Steven Northam (33), had the tiny chip transplanted between his thumb and finger, and is currently offering this service through the bioTeq vehicle to businesses and people who want to facilitate their lives with technology.
To ensure that the implant procedure could be implemented in medical standards, Winchester went to collaborate with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
The technology is similar to the micro chip that was transported to cats and dogs, and it only lasts 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also change the locks on homes and vehicles, including £300 per lock to match the chip.
The married man's house and BMW Z4 were both fitted with this technology, and his vehicle is running while his hands are behind the wheel.
The White House Show Cost Taxpayers Thousands
According to military records announced to TIME, the White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter into the southern grass for an organization that put American production forward last month cost taxpayers up to $24,000.
When the president boarded, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the center of attention in the event that introduced American construction programs on July 17 at the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officers toured products produced throughout 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was displayed side by side with a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississipi.
According to the records of the unit responsible for operating the helicopter, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House War Office requested the presence of the helicopter only 36 hours before landing on the southern lawn for the helicopter "unusual" organization, with an isolated order (also called FRAGO).
The commander of HMX-1 sent an e-mail to the superior Marine Corps Acting Commander of Aviation, writing, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually high-visibility organization."
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn around 7 a.m. on the morning of 17 July for the event at 3 p.m., where it would remain until the grass was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
The note added that if the exit from the White House was delayed, a second flight crew would be required for a return flight due to mission time limitations.
The original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel stood inside while the aircraft was on the ground.
From the records supplied to TIME, it is unclear if a second flight crew is ultimately necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violated this requirement.
"A question we asked was whether he violated the Hatch Law and it was reported to us that he did not."
"It seems you're locked in," replied the acting commander.
The "Made in America" organization has been designated an official organization by the White House and does not fall within the scope of the Hatch Law.
But even official organizations have political implications.
In the organization, the president referred to the efforts to reform health care that were then ongoing in the Senate and praised his efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a recent event.
Presidents need to use these to travel.
But it's unusual that these are only used for the opportunity to be photographed.
Trump noted that in February, when the presidential plane moved backstage to Melbourne Florida the first campaign rally and the Twitter account was filled with messages about the use of its predecessor's presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled by the 'Made in America' exhibition of products made with American materials by American workers from all 50 states," said Lindsay Walters, a White House press spokesperson.
The HMX-1 crew often make training flights in the Washington area and exercise to drop the U.S. President at the White House with a dot shot on the south lawn.
While Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 drill landings at the White House.
An official said that the flight for the Made in America organization counted as the air crew's need for training that month.
Unit helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "support missions that had nothing to do with the presidency".
The White House said taxpayers were not charged for any other number involved in the organization.
A spokesman from Sikorksky said their firm did not participate in setting up the helicopter's display on the southern lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to detect the exact expense incurred by the organization.
But according to the Ministry of Defence's hourly rates for the fiscal year 2017, the Ministry of Defence's rate of welcoming VH-3D is $24,340 per flight hour.
Unit records register the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the base in Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico Virginia to both sides.
The White House claims that the actual operating expense of the helicopter is far below that rate.
"It is very misleading to make an expense to taxpayers based on estimate of an expense rate," Walters said.
"These proportion estimates cover the sunken costs involved in personnel, maintenance and annual expenses."
According to a RAND research in 2015, the Department of Defense's expense rates do not include personnel costs but include fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer had advocated the use of the helicopter for this organization.
"The main idea here is to showcase what is being done in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I think hundreds of people's work depends on it, even if it's not thousands.
And like most Americans, I think we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans work tirelessly to do.
Therefore, it is proper to bring it forward."
It is unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while traveling the southern grass for the event, but stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump joked with the media about his own fleet of firm products, calling on representatives of Sikorsky.
"I know very well about Sikorsky," the president said, "I have three of them."

According to the U.N., Afghan democracy depends on women's political role
The head of B.M.'s mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections could be representative if all sections of society, including women, played a role.
Nicholas Haysom, acting chairman of the U.M. Assistance Mission, says hundreds of women competed in the provincial council election, three women competed for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be exaggerated," she said Wednesday's statement.
The elections can be truly representative and reliable if only women participate fully and are included in all sections of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5th.
The Taliban threatened the election process, which coincided with the time when international military operations became advisory missions.
This year's elections mark the peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the strong role of women would contribute to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women from 3.6 million registered voters have been enrolled.

GMB concern over McVitie's investment at the Glasgow plant
A union seeks assurance from the executives of biscuit manufacturer McVitie's that a long-term commitment be made to the production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross area.
Among other products, more than 500 people work at the factory where the Hobsons and Rich Tea biscuits are also produced.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, said they have invested over £5 million in the area over the past few years.
He added that if their operation changes, employees and union representatives will be "first informed".
In a letter to the company's facility manager, GMB Scotland requested McVitie's to "relieve concerns that there is no funding for the modernization of the production bands."
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said, "It deeply concerns our members that we cannot see any clarity from the general manager of Thesis about their needs of work and an investment plan for Tollcross' future.
For generations, families have worked here, and labor is concentrated in the local community and in Glasgow and its suburbs, a critical basis for adequate employment in a field of high unemployment and social deprivation.
From the perspective of work, pay and prosperity, Brexit conditions, against increased cost of living and chronic production reduction, urgently require a four-headed mamur production presence at Glasgow's eastern end McVitie's."
A female spokesperson from Pladis said: "The facility manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly because we value our commitment to workers and union representatives.
Two months ago at Tollcross, we had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the GMB, where several issues were clearly discussed.
So we told our employees that we were constantly reviewing our operations, so that we could stay competitive, like all companies doing business in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, which applies to all of our jobs and facilities.
He added: "In recent years we have invested over £5 million in the Tollcross facility, especially production bands and operational development.
We fully recognize Tollcross' legacy as a manufacturing facility, and in the event of any change in our operations at the facility, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Necip and Utku in Beşiktaş for another four years
The Beşiktaş Club extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran to four years.
Beşiktaş extended a contract with the two players until May 31, 2021, in an episode of the Turkish Football Federation's (TFF) website, featuring data on football players.
Necip, who grew up in the infrastructure of the black-and-white team and made his first professional contract on June 19, 2008, began playing for the A-team during the 2009–2010 season.
Upon rising to team captainship, 1991-born player played in a total of 254 official matches for Beşiktaş.
The TFF website also included information that the bonus of goalkeeper Utku Yuvukuran, whom Beşiktaş recruited on loan last season, was taken and signed with him until May 31, 2021.
Utku's information that he was removed from his temporary transfer status as of August 1, 2017 and renewed his license on August 2, is shown on his website.
Utku Yuvakuran served mainly in matches in the Under-21 League in Beşiktaş, where he played on loan last season.
The young goalkeeper served in only 2 Turkish Cup matches in a black-and-white jersey.
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar leaving three years ago?
La Liga may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up his pursuit of Neymar after submitting an offer that stimulated the £189 million release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of looting the world record three years ago?
With the Ligue 1 team ready to break the world transfer record more than twice as much last season when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for £89 million, the sensational bid moved the summer transfer period.
With PSG proposing a salary of £500,000 per week after taxes, it shows that when the transfer is completed, Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and also the most profitable professional athlete.
Although a source close to the Catalans' rule insisted that the club had always done its best to keep an eye on him from Santos' arrival in 2013, Barcelona is known to be angry about the style of the offer and Neymar's attempt to leave.
So, was the football world warned by the head of the PSG about this landscape three years ago?
When he expressed interest in signing Manchester City Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi gave a harsh warning to all clubs who wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be against them, contacting their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they will suffer the consequences."
Spanish club Barcelona seems to have crossed that line earlier this summer, expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG has made it clear that they will not allow the Italian nation to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona feels the reflections of that interest by losing Neymar from their greatest value.
The penalty for preventing Sala from being read has been overturned
The defendants Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yılmaz, who allegedly marched on and tried to stop Ezan and Sela, were accused of "helping the organization intentionally and willingly", "resisting not to have the mission done", and "insulting" were accused of Istanbul 22.
He was tried by the High Criminal Court.
Taking into account the charges of "insulting the public official for his position" and the way the crime was committed, the court has sentenced the defendant Yilmaz to one year in prison for "resisting not to commit the mission", considering the importance of his duty, which was prevented by the victim, as of the date and hour of the crime and Turkey's future.
The delegation ruled that the prison sentence given to Yilmaz be commuted to a fine of $6,000.
After two defendants were fined, the defendant's lawyers filed a motion for remand.
The case is being examined by İstanbul District Court Court 23.
He came to the Department of Corrections.
Upon completing his examinations, the agency ruled that the sentence imposed against the defendant Kenan Gülşen had been carried out in the legal context, that the action had been described as correct, and that he had followed the type of crime envisioned in the law, by essentially rejecting the sentence imposed on the defendant.
By the High Criminal Court, when defendant Nait Yilmaz read a flood and met the imam Mustafa Baki, who came out of the mosque, said, "You're putting the people on the street."
The President is taken.
"It's over," he said. "It's said that his attempt to march on him, to strike him, has been attributed to the crime of "resisting not to do the task", being acknowledged as causing the victim's imam to be unable to read the rancid and sala at certain intervals.
Although the grounds were stated by the local court, the agency stated that the action took place when the victim finished his mission to read and read the flood and evangelically informed the public in front of the mosque, noting that there was no duty in which the victim began or continued its execution, without discussion as to whether it constituted the crime of attempting to wound the victim due to the public duty it carried out, and that the defendant was convicted on an insufficient grounds of how the victim tried to prevent the duties he would later perform.
The defendant's lack of a criminal record, the agency which explained that the victim had no concrete financial damage due to the crimes imposed on the accused, said that it was not discussed whether or not the moral harm would be an obstacle to the application of the release of the sentence, and whether the victim would have given up his complaint.
The agency, which has seen the motions of the defendant Nait Yilmaz's attorney on these grounds, has decided that the verdict against the defendant will be overturned, that the case will be returned to the first degree court.
Six Europeans on Interpol's list of live bombs
The German newspaper Die Welt wrote that Interpol (International Police Service) sent a list of 173 people with the potential to launch suicide attacks on behalf of the terrorist organization DEAŞ last May to law enforcement agencies in European countries.
132 people on the list were reported to be from Iraq, North Africa, Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
The six people on the list were said to be European citizens.
They are said to have come from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
The person with a DEAŞ connection from Germany was reported to be a 27-year-old German citizen from Solingen, North Rhine Vestphalia.
The person reportedly went to Egypt first in the autumn of 2012, followed by Turkey, and finally Syria.
DEAŞ's statement from social media accounts in mid-July was noted to have announced that this person had died in Rakka.
The German Police Department was informed that the newspaper had not answered their questions about the matter.
The names on Interpol's list were said to have been seized in operations against DEAŞ in Mosul.
According to Die Welt, American intelligence services examined this list and sent it to Interpol.
Interpol was also quoted as delivering the list to police agencies in Europe in May.
