The professor confessed to killing his girlfriend by calling 911.
University Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told the police that he shot his girlfriend with a gun and that the police had to come home just a little shaky.
Lamb stated that his "lovely dog" was alive and probably sad and that the phones of the deceased woman's family could be found on the woman's cell phone.
The cops found Amy Prentiss's lifeless body at home and a handwritten note in a white notebook: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could turn everything around, I loved Amy so much, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," the officers stated that Lamb signed the note.
Lamb, who taught two online lectures for Delta State University in Mississippi, Cleveland, had no indication that police loved history professor Ethan Scmidt had already traveled 300 miles to the school campus where he thought he was shot and killed in front of his office by Lamb.
Lynn Buford, chief of police at Delta State University, said university officials heard shots at 10:18 p.m.
Lamb also stated that he made his desperate 911 call shortly after that.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as police approached him.
The day after the school shooting caused students and professors to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still investigating what drove Lamb to do so.
On both sides of the state, the details drawn by students and staff who knew him, as well as investigators, drew a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to attending his class.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, stated that Lamb's criminal and criminal record was not found.
In fact, in a book he wrote, Schmidt referred to Lamb as one of the "great people" he shared his academic life with.
Both had taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members were listed, and many students took lessons from both.
However, there were signs of mental problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who spoke highly of Lamb, stated that he was also a concerned and nervous person and seemed to have "a problem".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, stated that Lamb had told him that he was struggling with stress in late 2014–15 school year.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State University, stating that there were some health problems.
This year he was only teaching two online classes.
Recent changes in the University's hiring policies could not guarantee that Lamb would automatically become a tenured lecturer despite his doctoral degree, which he worked hard to win.
College Dean William LaForge stated that he did not know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "it is obvious that Lamb has something on his mind."
These are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the campus was evacuated, police traced Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
In the backyard of a house about a mile from his family's home in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Chief of Forensic Investigation Methel Johnson announced that Lamb committed suicide with a single .38 caliber gun before he could be arrested.
Lamb's car was found running on the highway.
Although it was not immediately determined why Lamb went to this house, Johnson stated that he believed Lamb knew the inhabitants of this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at the 3,500-student university of the city with about 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 and was teaching geography and education.
He received his Ph.D. in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through her mutual friends.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was an older nice guy who tried to teach him how to play guitar for a few years.
Back then, he was the one who made the hearts beat fast.
Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon City, said of Lamb, "All the girls would melt when he arrived."
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for a while.
The 911 call said Lamb killed my wife, but there's no official record of them getting married.
They had a dog, Lightning, who lived with them in their brick house located by a river in Gautier.
The police have stated that the dog is in good condition.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but he and Prentiss were always friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also stated that his daughter was completely devastated.
He and his mother were great friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb but heard Lamb, his daughter, from Abigail, was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail were performing at a summer festival.
Then Lamb and Abigail played together in the general demonstrations.
O'Steen stated that he wrote and sang his daughter's music.
Prentiss was a nurse working for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dim bar near Gautier, said Lamb and Prentiss last saw Lamb on the night of September 5 after Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica to a small number of spectators.
There was no sign of trouble.
He said they were quite a happy couple.
Sometimes we were cutting and throwing a line at each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the same university, stated that the murdered professor Schmidt had directed the seminar program for freshmen and was an expert on Native Americans and colonial history.
He was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was also president of a student solidarity group he founded himself.
On Tuesday night at the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland, some 900 people attended the candle planting ceremony, including academics, university employees, students and visitors from locals.
Schmidt's wife Liz and her brother Jeff Schmidt attended the memorial ceremony, where the college choir sang the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Great Grace".
Classes continue on Wednesday.
"We are trying to bring our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to heal the wounds.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (in Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (in New Orleans) contributed to this news.
This news text has been corrected to reflect this upon police stating that Lamb had called 911 after killing Schmidt and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his "wife" on the 911 call, there was no official evidence that the two had been married.
Toys R Us Plans to Get Less Holiday Season Employees
Toys R Us announced this year that he would not hire as many holiday season staff as last year, but the toy and doll products manufacturer said it would allow existing employees and seasonal workers more work.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people at department stores and distribution centres across the country, the figure was 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work will be part-time.
The company said interviews with candidates would begin later this month and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although the holiday season is still months away, the holiday shopping season is coming up, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to help them decorate their stores and sell products, send and distribute products.
Michael J. Fox, The Princess Made Jokes About Diana's "Relationship"
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a crucial moment for Michael J. Fox.
And it was very important for personal reasons.
He describes this in the trailer of the newly released documentary Back in Time: "We were sitting in the theater waiting for members of the Royal Family to arrive, and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and I knew Princess Diana would sit next to me.
The movie started, and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was a fake stretch and arm stretch away from me.
It includes interviews with Back in Time, Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, a documentary about the film "Back to the Future", as well as director Robert Zemeckis and practitioner producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future was first released 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time travel film ever made for me."
Back in Time will be shown in VOD and DVD formats as well as some distinguished cinemas.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Regarding Russia's growing military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the Syrian problem, which has been going on for nearly five years, "can't be solved by military intervention" and that more weapons will only be more violence and pain for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also invited all parties, including the UN Security Council, who is divided, to meet and hold constructive talks in an effort to find a political solution to the problem.
At a press conference Wednesday, Ban said he plans to meet Syria with the foreign ministers of five permanent councillors, the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France at the UN General Assembly meeting, which will be held towards the end of the month.
He said he was deeply upset that the division between council members and Syrian people "makes the problem unsolvable" by regional forces.
Ban invited five permanent members to join forces in the Syrian crisis, as did the Iranian nuclear agreement.
8 Poll Numbers Showing that Donald Trump Is Serious
Some tried to label it as a volcano.
The others threw it away like a joke.
And some of them support internal explosions.
Some Republicans tried to pull Donald Trump down in the polls, but this (yet) did not work.
The 11 most recent national polls showed him leading Donald Trump in double digits, and some are seriously starting to ask for the chance of the real estate emperor to run.
Of course, it's early in the election cycle.
None of this means Trump can win the Republican nomination race.
Experts state that Rick Perry's rise at this time in 2011 also caused a rise for Herman Cain, both failing to win the nomination process in a single state.
And there are a lot of reasons he's going to have a hard time with the general election.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC group and the Economic Conservative Group, Growth Club, are becoming aware of Trump's lasting power and are beginning to spend their dollars to overthrow it.
Here are some recent poll results showing that the real estate emperor is not just temporary:
Trump's preference rates changed by 180 degrees.
A poll at the University of Monmouth just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June showed that two of the 10 Republicans for the estate emperor had a positive view.
In mid-July, this rate was 40 percent.
By early August, it was 52 percent.
Six of the 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Of the roughly 10, three express negative vision.
And these numbers are high in early stages.
Last week, a poll in Quinnipiac, Iowa showed that 60 percent of Republicans there preferred Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters may be satisfied with the Trump nomination.
A CNN/ORC poll last week said 67 per cent of Republicans would be "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump ran.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "sorry" if he were to run.
Only Ben Carson creates the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (who said they would be 43 percent "excited" for Trump, while this rate for Trump is 40 percent).
The next person closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican voters say that if Jeb Bush, the institution's favorite, runs, they will "not be pleased" or "sorry".
The majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
Donald Trump is criticized for his flashy language and contempt, while 52 per cent of Republicans asked questions Monday according to ABC News/ Washington Post polls think the real estate emperor has the right temperament to be president.
The same figure applies in Iowa, where the country's first party board will be held, where according to Quinnipac last week, 52 per cent of Republicans think he has the personality to be the leader.
He still thinks he does not have the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six out of 10 in the independents say his temperament does not fit the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their political expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of 10 said Trump was the best when asked who the best candidate was to win the GOP nomination.
A change in favor of the end of July, when four out of 10 put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal ball of GOP voters was not clear.
In the last election cycle at the time, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would run, in turn only 28 percent had finally elected Mitt Romney, who had run.
The majority of GOP voters still seem to find Trump's election campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans gather around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the disorganized area may also contribute to Trump's prominence, and it is also a fact that anti-Trump support is scattered among more than a dozen candidates.
However, a Monmouth University poll conducted at the beginning of September shows Trump receiving the majority's support each time, in the event of a head-to-head match between Trump and many Republican candidates.
He scores Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
In the event of a possible head start, Ben Carson passes the businessman by 19 points.
The majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they have made their decisions.
A new CBS/NYT poll, which aired on Tuesday, shows that more than half the voters supporting Trump said they had locked their votes.
Frankly, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say that they won't change their mind.
He said they left the door open to replace 46 percent candidates.
Still Trump's biggest rival is brain surgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've made their decision are twice as close to voting for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "raper" in his campaign ad address two months ago, the topic at the beginning and center of the 2016 conversations was immigration.
Some think that Trump's much talk has distanced key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and will damage efforts to rebrand.
However, six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration-related issues, according to the new ABC/Post poll on Monday.
So as long as the immigration issue remains on the agenda, it looks like Trump will stay on the agenda.
Anger with the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson roughly receive half the Republican vote due to their largely external situation.
In a new ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they want someone outside instead of someone with government experience.
And they're mad at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of every four Republicans in Iowa were angry at Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were "unsatisfied" and 21 percent were "extremely angry".
Jeremy Corbyn will take the stand for the first time in the Prime Minister's Questions
Mr. Corbyn was eagerly expected to appear on the bench in Question to the Prime Minister since his election.
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will take the stand in the Prime Minister's Questions for the first time after David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will ask six questions shortly after this afternoon, and his performance will appear to be closely reviewed by the media and Labour MPs.
In the weekly display, he called for "less theatre and more real".
He also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to his colleagues.
This encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, his appointment of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the TUC annual convention on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Labour leader's silence during the reading of the national anthem at the memorial ceremony to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England on Tuesday has been criticised by some Tory MPs and focuses on front-page news.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to accompany the national anthem was noted.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he stood in a "respective silence" and appreciated "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England".
However, Owen Smith, one of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet members, told BBC Two's News Night programme that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem as "independent" from his belief in the elimination of the monarchy.
Due to differences in economics, defence and foreign relations, about a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr. Corbyn's top team, while less than one-sixth of those at the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant states that policy differences within the Labour Party are also beginning to "strength", and that these are the issues of Mr Corbyn's appointment over the position in the European Union and the government's upper limit on aid implementation.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party offered new changes regarding completely removing the upper limit.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow minister of work and retirement, said that the party was only opposed to the government lowering the top limit of £23,000, which was £23,000, and was "very clear" about it.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Party leader to face on the bench from the time David Cameron became Conservative Party leader.
The Labour leader promised a different approach to politics and said he had received "public-sourced" and over 30,000 recommendations to ask Mr Cameron.
Islington North MP told the Prime Minister that the Questiones program was very fronting and would focus on poverty, inequality, and the challenges faced by young people rather than exchange sarcastic lyrics with "answer raising".
When Mr Corbyn was not himself, for example, when Mr Cameron was traveling abroad, he told the Prime Minister that he would be represented by Angela Eagle, the shadow trade minister on the Questiones program.
He even suggested from time to time that other colleagues should also take the stand, and also told House of Commons Spokesperson John Bercow that he had applied to address the issue.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron expressed a desire to get away from "The Kukla Game" style politics, often associated with the Prime Minister's Program of Questions, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in this regard.
Since its first release in 1990, the Question to the Prime Minister program has been used as a fundamental measurement point to measure the leaders' decision-making capabilities, their dominance in the House of Commons, and their position among the Deputies; in contrast, some critics have said it was caricatured and needed very extensive reforms.
'It was shot in Joburg': homeless teenagers are studying photography
Johannesburg City is a tough place for homeless people.
However, a group of former street kids found a way to acquire a new talent and make a living.
I was shot in Joburg, a non-profit studio that teaches homeless teenagers how to photograph their neighborhoods and make a profit out of it.
BBC News went to meet one of the first graduates of the project.

The pounds are rising as wages increases in the United Kingdom accelerate
Following data showing increased wages in the United Kingdom, a rapid rise in the pound, while the FTSE 100 index also rose following an offer of purchases for SABMiller.
Except for the premium in the United Kingdom, wages increased 2.9% from the same period of the previous year between May and July.
This rate, which refers to the fastest increase since 2009, is also seen as one of the leading indicators for possible interest increases.
The pound gained more than 1% against the US dollar, increasing to $1.5505 and 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index increased by 1.49% to 6,229.21 points.
The most notable company in this rise was SABMiller, who made a 20% increase with an attractive acquisition bid from its rival EU InBev.
This offer will unite the two largest beer companies in the world, and famous brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will meet under the same roof.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% as a result of positive profit news from rival luxury retail group Richemont.
Richemont's current sales figures showed that sales were starting to increase again in China, one of the key markets for Burberry, as well as rising expectations.
Mining giant Glencore's shares rose 5% after the company announced that it had made $2.5 billion from its dedicated stock sale as part of its strategy to reduce its debt.
The stocks of packaging and paper group Mondi were among the most valuable-losing shares, with a 4.3% loss of value after Goldman Sachs dropped his proposal for the company to "Sat".
JD Sports' stake rose 3.1% after the company announced that its six-month pre-tax profits had risen to £46.6 million with an increase of 83%.
JD Sports boss said higher salaries could damage expansion
The chairman of the JD Sports Board, Peter Cowgill, said that higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers".
However, he said that this spending power, according to him, could not exceed the high-employment costs at his own company.
He added that costs would affect JD Sports' expansion plans, which could mean less extra work.
Metcash launched a public campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market wholesaler Metcash launched a public campaign to defend retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against a $700 million Aldi invasion.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers in South Australia and Western Australia at the start of next year and the first of their stores to reach 120, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and are trying to create the IGA brand with mainstream and social media marketing and activities such as the Adelaide fair.
IGA pekingers and suppliers also contribute with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo, which offers flavor testing at IGA stores, and store owners who sell their loyal customers discounted South Australian football league tickets.
Metcash, a wholesaler of food, liquor and hardware, is expected to present further details about the defence strategy as the annual investor strategy improves its day on September 29th.
The risk is huge, as South Australia and Western Australia represent almost 30% of Metcash's IGA store footprint and produces higher profit margins than the IGA network in Metcash's eastern states.
South Australia and Western Australian store owners are negatively narrow-minded and IGA retailers are enjoying a much stronger market share than they have achieved in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; 30% in the GA compared to Eastern states; and 24% more in BA.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi would take over about 5% of the market market within 12 months of opening their first store in these two states, taking sales away from current players but generally bapless retailers.
In a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers would lose $360 million within a year and Metcash would lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This estimate is based on Aldi's prediction that next year he will open 30 stores in GA and BA, and will acquire $500 million and $600 million in sales in each market.
Mr Kierath stated that the loss of food and market sales and Metcash's high fixed cost base volumes could cost Metcash about $13 million in interest and pre-tax earnings.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in eastern states, primarily Aldi and Coles, despite recent Roy Morgan research, which reveals that IGA customers are the most loyal customers.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's food and market sales will be reduced to y3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, which will reduce its market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, said at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "could most likely be deleted within a decade."
Metcash refused to respond to Mr. Douglass' comments.
However, it appears a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has declined from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash's earnings from the food and grocery business providing supplies to about 1,200 IGA retailers have dropped 43% since 2012, an indication that business leverage rate has decreased as sales and margins enter under pressure.
However, the wholesaler resists, investing more than $150 million a year for shelf prices matching in the face-to-face product at Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers to renovate their stores, adding faster-growing fresh food, and opening a better special-label market series to the public.
Ian Morrice, chairman of the Metcash executive board, says price matching and store renewal programs have begun to yield results, and it is the first time the wholesaler has been expected to return to basic snow growth in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi deserves more credit for his behavior than criticism.
According to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis was in the accidentally damaged position in the last storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and deserves more praise than criticism.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented duo, normally referred to as the "Special K's", found himself under spotlights that did not welcome Kyrgios's face-breaking crush on Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In the afternoon difficult qualifying match in Cincinnati, when Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison left by the net umpire twice, Harrison said: "Wawrinka came at Kyrgios, I have to go on top of that boy."
The last seen in the US Open potentially breaking Richard Gasquet's racket to upset him, Kokkinakis was loyally defended by Healy.
The young player is currently competing with Sam Groth in Glasgow for the second singles post behind Bernard Tomic against Britain in the Davis Cup semifinals.
Healy said, "What I feel quite enthusiastic about is that I think Thanasi has been drawn to the debate."
He broke his racket in the United States when his front was closed and when he lost, but he wasn't the first player to break a racket because he was disappointed in himself, and I know Thanasi is well aware that he shouldn't be proud of it either.
But in reality, in the United States, he handled himself quite well under highly provocative circumstances with Harrison and others, and I think he deserves a lot of praise.
He's got a great team around him, a great family, and I think he's been a little hard on himself.
Although he is 19 years old, he is extremely mature, working hard and adapting to the team, he has no problem with other players, he is well received in the locker room, he practices hard, he is a highly balanced and mature young man, and I think he deserves to be judged in his own parables.
Healy also supported his decision to tolerate Kyrgios for the important draw; from Friday, he began to explain that what was right for everyone was to "take a reciprocal decision" but to support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term fixture.
"First of all, we want the team to focus not on the strife around [Kyrgios] but on the game altogether," Healy said.
And I think, as people like Nick, Federer, and Murray have pointed out, the boy is up too fast, growing up in front of the public and making some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's received, but we're trying to support him, help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he's not in the spotlight, he thinks deeply that my thinking is appropriate, that it's best for the team and himself.
European immigrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Hungary declared an emergency Tuesday to cut off the flow of immigrants, closing its southern border with Serbia and detaining those trying to break into the country illegally.
With hundreds of migrants piling up in neutral territory, create chaos at the border and Serbian officials act in anger.
Emigrants who escaped violence in their home country tented on the side of the road for an uncertain period of time between the two countries’ checkpoints.
However, their anger was growing.
As a police helicopter passed through the top, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Others rejected water and food as a protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" for Hungary to repatriate migrants as the immigration movement from Macedonia and Greece continues.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not hurt by the process.
Talks with Brussels and other countries will be needed in the coming days," Ivica Dacic Pragueda said.
This tension on the Hungarian-Serbia border occurred just one day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
They agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 emigrants who are attacking Greece and Italy, and voiced hope that by the end of next month or year, an agreement would be reached to accept another 120,000 immigrants from Hungary into EU countries, including those among them who will come from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an EU summit next week to discuss this immigration crisis facing the continent on Tuesday.
Hungary is not hopeful that Brussels or its neighbours will take any concrete steps towards the issue.
The emergency call for Tuesday in the two southern regions gives authorities broad powers to fight the crisis, including blocking roads and speeding up cases related to asylum seekers if necessary.
On the other hand, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said he plans to pull barbed wire along his border with Romania to stop the flow of immigrants from this country after the barbed wire his country has pulled to the border with Serbia.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata announced that even prisoners in prisons have been assigned in their efforts to pull barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
For the past few months, Hungary has become an important narrow gateway and transit point to European Union countries, and most of these immigrants are asylum seekers who have fled wars in Syria and other Middle East countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the immigrants who come are "economically motivated immigrants" who are trying to move to Europe for a better life than innocent people who have come to flee war -- the idea is completely contrary to the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
Laws enacted in Hungary at midnight bring harsher penalties to human traffickers, as well as making it a crime to cross a 10-metre (13 feet) long barbed wire drawn to the border with Serbia.
In a statement to reporters in the southern city of Szeged, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "The Hungarian government declares an emergency because of the situation caused by mass immigration".
We have a clear idea: illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Although the troop deployment should yet be approved by parliament, Associated Press reporters in the region say they have seen soldiers with heavy guns and vehicles here for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said authorities had captured 15 people who crossed the border with 45 people trying to cross the border.
They passed by damaging barbed wire, now in police custody, and are charged with crimes under new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing barbed wire.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia on Tuesday morning, while using a train car covered with barbed wire to close one of the crossings.
The chaos was also reflected in the main border crossing point near Roszke, as Hungarians activated a small metal container, where people were packed in for operations.
Even though 20 people got in, thousands of them got out.
Another group of immigrants said they would not accept food and water aid until they were allowed to enter Hungary by shutting down the highway connecting Serbia and Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's superiority over Bernie Sanders drops by half in national election
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues her two-figure lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Sen. Bernie Sanders catches up with her.
Clinton is currently in second position with Sanders 27 (up from 17%) as she received 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is in the presidential race, receives 15% of the democratic vote.
More than five months before the start of the main races, most Democratic voters said it was too early to decide which candidate they would support.
Clinton's supporters, however, have more sound ideas about their own choices than any other candidate.
Since last month's CBS News, Clinton has been losing ground between a series of demographic groups, while Sanders, on the other hand, has some gains.
Clinton leads by a huge margin between women and moderates, but that difference closes.
His support among men has dropped greatly, and Sanders only follows him five points behind.
Clinton's Democratic voter advantage under 50 has evaporated, and he and Sanders are now even.
However, Clinton leads the right by a huge margin in terms of older voters.
Last month, Clinton was moving ahead of Sander with two-digit steps between liberals, but now Sanders is five points ahead in this group.
At the national level, about half of the Democratic voters are passionately saying they will support Clinton if she becomes the party's candidate.
A quarter will support him under some circumstances, while another 15% will only support him if he is a candidate.
Six percent don't support Clinton.
Perhaps in an unsurprising way, Clinton's current supporters tend especially to support her passionately.
Opinions between those who do not currently support Clinton are even more complicated - only a quarter of them can support it passionately.
48 percent of Democrats express their passionate support for Clinton, while less Republican leading candidates talk about Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters were asked open-ended questions as to why they wanted Clinton to run, the first answer was that she had the right experience (16 percent), the idea that it was now time to elect a female president (13 percent) and the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also express his relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Being conciliatory in problems and selectability are also among the criteria specified.
As a vice president with potential for the presidency, 57 per cent of Democratic voters may want to see him in the race, but a third of them do not think so.
When Democrats voters are asked what the second candidate election for the party is, Biden is top.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that according to Sander, Biden may have had by far the second election.
If Biden does not enter the Democratic Candidate race, Hillary Clinton's superiority over Sanders increases; her level, which is 20 points in a race with Biden, rises to 30 points in a race without Biden.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning a general election; however, that figure dropped from 78 percent last month to this level.
Biden is second, but the percentage of those who see him as the most electible candidate has increased.
Once again, when asked what is the most important thing in a candidate, Democratic voters keep issues ahead of electability.
Similar to last month, no Democratic constituency candidate or candidate candidate seems unacceptable to these primary constituencies.
Democratic candidates or candidate candidates perform well in some of the main characteristics among the primary constituencies of their own parties.
The majority see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and reliable, as well as strong leadership qualifications.
Biden is first among the three in integrity, while Clinton is strong in leadership.
According to 30% of Democratic voters, Clinton is dishonest and unreliable, with half of which saying the same for Sanders (15 percent) has no opinion on this.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden in the same direction as their own ideology.
In all the criteria, a quarter of the Democratic voters have no idea about Sanders.
While questions continue about his personal e-mail address and use of his server during his post at the Foreign Ministry, most Democratic voters find the statement satisfactory and point out that his views on the issue are not affected.
But this is a different story in general American public opinion.
Half of Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations, while only a third of them find it satisfactory.
Public opinion on the issue was divided in March, shortly after the problem was taken under lens.
Most Americans say e-mail disputes do not affect their general opinion of Clinton, while on the other hand his negative ideas have increased by 36 percent.
They're Republicans in general, and more than six out of 10 people say they've lost their views on Clinton.
Although Clinton is viewed as honest and reliable by the voters of her own party, this issue is still a problem among registered voters in general: only 32% consider her honest and reliable, while this figure has dropped eight points according to last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't find him honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not find Trump honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are getting good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates who took the test, Biden, Carson and Bush scored the best points on honesty.
More often find Sanders honest, but as with Carson, most of them have no idea about him.
The margin of error in samples taken from 351 Democratic voters is 6%.
Ben Carson is right behind Donald Trump in the national polls.
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump.
The new poll shows that about half of the two candidates accounted for the vote, with the other candidates having little chance.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, your support, which was 23% in the last CBS poll held before last month's debate on Fox News, is climbing to 27% in the poll announced Tuesday.
However, support for Carson rose from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The poll also found that Carson was doing well in demographic groups, with much higher support among college-educated Republican voters than Trump.
The rest are now down to 2% from last month's 10 percent support with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
This newest poll, conducted with 376 people elected from among Republican voters, had a margin of error of 6% and a poll conducted in September.
Last CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson's support among Republicans by 19%, just behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll by the ABC News/Washington Post showed Trump seriously ahead of Carson.
Faced with Carson's rise last week, Trump apologized for questioning Carson Trump's faith, but continued to randomly wave to the retired neurosurgeon.
At a campaign stop in Iowa, Trump said last Saturday that "we need energy."
Five fraternity members are charged with the death of a Baruch College freshman
During an initiation ceremony in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, murder cases were filed against five people almost two years after the death of a college student.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity attacked Chun "Michael" Deng hard at a September 2013 commencement ceremony, and according to police, he contributed to his death by delaying taking him to the hospital.
Authorities reported that his eyes were blindfolded, a backpack full of 30 pounds of sand was attached to his back, and that he was constantly tripped as he tried to walk towards the target in a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained over time, stating that his head had hurt and later lost consciousness.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 after Deng passed out and, according to police, waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
However, according to Police Commissioner Chris Wagner, speaking at a press conference, they changed Deng's clothes, Googled his symptoms, and contacted the national president of the fraternity, Andy Meng, asking for advice.
At this point, Commissioner Wagner said the members began to hide personal belongings and put the goodness of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng.
He was not revived and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng sustained repeated traumas to the head, torso and hip with blunt force trauma.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement that many families have been destroyed as a result of the Brotherhood initiation ceremonies, with at least one student dying every year since 1970.
The brotherhood and its members should be held accountable for this, and this step taken by the authorities is crucial.
The Monroe Town grand jury recommended a lawsuit for the first five members on charges of third-degree murder.
Thirty-two fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with initiation ceremony and criminal conspiracy to attack.
At a press conference Tuesday, Wagner said, we will not only hold those involved, but we will hold them responsible if there is an organization that officially or unofficially confirms it.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood ended its relationship with this local unit.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rates?
With interest rates rising, the bull market is upside down and bond revenues climb, and the economy records decline.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this is going to take.
History, especially in economics, offers little knowledge of timing.
The decline has taken as long as 86 months, as the decline took place in as little as 11 months after the initial interest rate increase.
The U.S. Central Bank Fed's aggressiveness in increasing interest rates has often been decisive in the response of economics and financial assets, although not continuous.
That is why U.S. central bank officials strongly emphasize when interest begins to increase, but rather how long the normalization process should take.
It's a fact that there are various variables.
However, market participants may think that the interest increase rush has been exaggerated.
"It is inevitable that Fed's initial interest increase since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as pointing out that the 'free money' period has come to an end," said Julian Jessop, the Global Archdiocese of Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect U.S. interest rates to gradually return to normal, but it appears to be the seismic blow most of the levels that are still low are afraid of.
Still, we can't say they won't have any effect.
Based on past trends, some areas of the economy may react as follows:
As seen in recent months on the market, waiting for interest rates to increase may destabilize things for a while.
The effect won't be that obvious when interest is increased.
In a new study of what will happen after the Fed upgrades, Deutsche Bank analysts said, "The equity revenues appear to be a 12-24 month pause trend after the initial interest increase, which may reflect the pause in monetary policy."
According to an up-to-date analysis shared by Bob Doll, one of the Nuveen Asset Management analysts, Barron's, the market has mostly recorded sharp rises in the past 35 years -- around 14 per cent -- and after 250 days, it's going straight to interest increase (average 2.6 per cent increase) and after 500 days, it's back to normal and averaged 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles.
Deutsche said that the impact on the shares became more prominent in the later stages of the interest-enhancing cycle and that the bring was facing extinction.
Reductions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases also help them.
In the current situation, the Fed faces some situations that have not been available before and will speed up the decline.
The most notable is that the gross domesticity is at its lowest level to date for a Fed interest increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increase since 1950 has dropped below 4.5 per cent in gross domestic product only twice from nominal year to year.
Although the second quarter of 2015 took place at 3.6 per cent, according to the Atlanta Fed, this situation is expected to be permanent by very few, with the third quarter watching at 1.5 per cent.
According to Deutsche, increasing interest rates in such a delicate economic environment can be risky and can lead to the question "will it be different this time?"
The attention of the market participants, who have been waiting for the Fed's interest increase for a year, is at a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends Thursday.
Although he believes most strategists and economist FOMC can approve an increase at this meeting, the future trade points to only 25 per cent probability.
"In our research since 1950, all the increases cycles that have occurred to this day are in a super-climbing trend cycle, and the gross domestic product is rapidly reaching pre-recession peaks following the initial recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was an unprecedented slow recovery from the worst regression in a model period.
The current cycle was the longest cycle the Fed had expected since the last decline—the longest cycle on record has been 35 months, and the cycle we're in is still in its 74th month.
With interest increase expected in the market, the fixed income has also become unstable, and the order is similar to that of a bit of equity.
The difference is that when you change the course of Fed policy, the effect is seen faster in bonds than in stocks.
When the first increase/fall of the cycle comes, bond returns do not change direction immediately.
At the end of the interest increase cycle, bond revenues fall instantly," Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab strategy experts, increases in interest will flatten the slope by zooming in revenues between longer and shorter-term bonds.
Kathy Jones, a Schwab analyst who said that high-income bonds usually perform better in an environment like this in analysis, but said "we are still careful about getting to the bottom of it."
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets have already adapted to Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the decline in dollar power and inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market is regulated according to tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest increases, yield curve smooth, credit spreads expanded and surge increased - all features to be seen in the market when FED tightens policy.
From a wide perspective, companies that do most of their jobs in the United States will gain interest rates and local products will be more attractive.
The situation of multinational companies with large debts will be worse, as the increasing dollar will make the products more expensive in the global market and their debt will be even more expensive.
Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report they prepared for their customers, "History shows that 'quality' stocks could suffer performance low at the beginning of such an increase."
Companies with strong balance sheets averaged 5 per cent, following increases in rates of 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital fetched and low fluctuating stocks also surpassed their low quality opponents (100 percent) by 4 and (100 percent) by 3 averages.
Debt will become a big deal.
According to Goldman, companies with high levels of fluctuating courtship debt are most likely to suffer.
Consumers are predicted to benefit from the increased dollar, except for the pure stock market game.
Although experts have different views on how to keep it fast, the savers can also profit from high gains.
Andrew Bingham said BBC Radio 3 A copy of Classic FM
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accused the station of 'briefing'
He argued that radio is becoming increasingly like its commercial rivals
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and accused her of ripping off the Brit Awards.
His acting friend Damien Collins accused The Voice of being unoriginal.
A prominent deputy pressured the publisher to show his difference to other commercial stations, saying that BBC Radio 3 was increasingly "transforming" to Classic FM.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said that the radio station, which provides public service to BBC patrons, is "in cahoots" and is becoming increasingly different from its commercial rivals.
"I don't like to use that phrase, but Radio 3 has become "failed", becoming Classic FM," he said.
In addition, the first cited the BBC Music Awards held last December.
It's like another version of the BBC Music Awards Brit Awards that were launched last year.
"So if you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples I can think of, whereas you're copying the same ones that already exist in the market," Bingham said.
The BBC general manager denied the accusations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is by far ahead of its commercial rivals on both live music and public education issues.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm gonna go learn something about classical music somewhere else.
And that is a commitment to live music, and making music is nothing compared to anything else.
He also spoke that I think the effort by Radio 3 to explore new music and promote work is also very important.
BBC Radio 3 executive Alan Davey had claimed at the beginning of this year that radio had to work harder to reach more audiences than in the past, as Britons were less educated in classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the BBC's only component held to the ball for stepping on the tail of its commercial rivals at a meeting of the Cultural, Media and Sports select committee.
Congressman Tory Damien Collins also teased O Sound - the music talent competition in which the BBC copyrighted £22 million from Dutch production company Talpa Media.
Can't you see why the program makes so much noise, because it's not original and it's not special?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which was juryd by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was made "with a style specific to BBCC".
He said he wished the agency would "find a hit of its own blood" before making another entertainment show.
However, he also did not accept the idea of further blocking the construction of that Sound program in the future or spending the amount spent on the licensing fee on other formats.
Is Black Friday the reason that Internet sales experienced the lowest increase in history in August?
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in internet sales.
The lowest growth has been recorded since 2000, when records began to break last month.
There was an explosion in Internet sales three years ago when mobile devices began to be used for shopping.
Experts say Black Friday in November may be the reason for cutting spending
Shopping online has been booming for over a decade, turning the most vibrant shopping streets in England into a ghost town.
After figures showing only a seven per cent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say internet sales are increasingly showing signs of weakening.
The total amount of spending in August was only five per cent higher than last year, with the lowest growth since 2000, when the records began to break.
After figures showing only a seven per cent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say Internet sales are increasingly showing signs of weakening.
IMRG sales index editor Andy Mulcahy told the Guardian, "If you look at the growth levels of previous years and especially 2000, you'll actually see that things are back to normal over time."
He added that Internet sales made a major increase three years ago, when consumers began using mobile phones to buy products.
It meant more people could shop even when they were lying on the couch.
But it's going horizontal now, so you can see the landing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept from America, is cited as one of the reasons sales are slowing down.
Experts say consumers may be waiting for this event, which took place on the last Friday of November, to buy something.
At last year's event, many companies' sites had collapsed when five times more consumers attacked companies' websites to get cheap products than the previous year.
Experts say Black Friday may have restrained shoppers "for now" showing shoppers fighting over a discount.
A study published by the British Association of Retailers revealed that £1 of every £5 spent on shopping was spent online on buying products.
A third of the products, such as TV and washing machines, are now purchased at Internet stores.
And more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of luxury and fancy shopping streets.
With the Bin Laden family found guilty, Muslims bid farewell to those killed in a crane crash in Mecca
The bodies of 29 people who died after the first funerals in Mecca were moved on the streets by Muslims
Saudi Arabia blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin group as responsible for crane crash
The health ministry reports that a total of 394 people were injured following the fall of the crane.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the bodies of 29 people who died when a crane fell into the Masjid-i-Haram.
The crowd, mostly in white, blocked the roads to bid their first funeral farewell to their final voyage at the Muaysim Cemetery in Mecca.
The painful mass passed the sacred place where a crane destroyed the ceiling of the mosque a few days ago and the pilgrims were overthrown.
The bodies of the dead were brought in for burial, after the Saudi Kingdom held the Binladin family responsible for the construction conglomerate, also in the case of 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 pilgrims who died when a crane fell into the Masjid-i-Haram were carried on shoulders along the way.
Among the dead was Kasim Akram, the father of four children from the Bolton area of Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr. Akram came to the Sacred Mosque with his parents at the beginning of the annual pilgrimage.
Saudi leaders reported that the Pilgrimage would continue with the participation of thousands of pilgrims on their way to Mecca.
King Salman reported today that the Binladin Holding group should not have left the crane's arm open while it was out of use.
The Arabic version of the edict by the state-run Saudi Press Agency said the Binladin Group was the only one to be charged with the incident.
The news agency's English service did not pass this detail, but informed firm officials that a travel ban had been imposed abroad.
At the beginning of the week, Salman vowed that they would find the reason why the crane was toppled into the courtyard of the Sacred Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had arrived in the Pilgrimage at the end of the month.
The Binladin group made no statement about the downed crane and their representatives were not allowed to comment.
The royal edict accused the group of not taking current security measures and not cooperating with meteorological officials.
The Masjid-i-Haram in Mecca is surrounded by dozens of cranes, much of which are under the direction of the Binladin group.
The Binladin family has been in close relations with Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and is the head of most construction projects.
The last leader of the Al Qaeda organization, Osama Bin Laden, was also a heretic son whom the family disallowed from adoption.
The accident occurred only a few days before millions flocked to the land of Hajj, where each adult Muslim was supposed to visit at least once in their lives, when there was heavy wind and rain.
Officials have reported that 158 people are still being treated at the hospital.
Authorities instructed families of the dead and survivors with permanent injury to pay compensation of £1 million Riyal (£174,000).
The other wounded will take half of that amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European craftsmen work cheaply behind this trend.
Veronique Laury says the Britons are hiring more and more masters.
The number of Eastern European master craftsmen is behind this increase
As a result, 200 new screwfix stores targeting artisans are opening
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q sales points across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail City Chief Reporter
It is said that the Britons have begun to hire skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do the work at home instead of leaving hammers and paintbrushes in their hands.
If you're good at hammering or painting walls, you're in the minority these days.
Because according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, the Britons are increasingly employing more and more masters to do DIY work at their home.
Veronique Laury, the new general manager of Kingfisher, the owner of the home improvement chain, said that behind this trend there was a major increase in the number of Eastern European skilled craftsmen offering services to low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 new Screwfix stores for artisans as he closes 60 B&Q sales points.
Miss Laury said she wanted more women hired at B&Q stores because eight of the ten purchase decisions in the store were made by women.
Currently, the majority of staff are male.
She said that the single woman's house, which made more home improvements compared to the past, was a need to meet the emerging demographic trends.
Mrs. Laury said: "Man still works mostly in our stores.
We need to balance more.
Basically, half of our clients are women and 80 percent of the decisions on purchased products are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Miss Laury, one of five women in charge of Britain's leading firms index FTSE100, also restructured her upper team to consist of an equal number of male and female principals.
Kingfisher, including his general manager and finance manager, 50 percent of his team are almost alone in this area with a staff of women.
Ms. Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women to take into our board of directors.
After the group loaded the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher announced a drop in both lower-month profits and sales.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, owner of Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores
Time to decide interest increase for US Central Bank FED
The US Central Bank is monitored by the world for its two-day meetings, which continue on Wednesdays and Thursdays; a decision is expected to be made ten years later to decide whether interest rates will be increased.
In a poll conducted by Reuters, a little more than half of 80 economists said the FED would implement this decision last week, while now they think it would suspend the decision and keep the rates at 0.25 per cent.
Since it's been seven years since the Fed's downgraded rates to zero, it's a historic event.
"For the first time, we will witness that a large central bank has come out of its zero point and started the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior researcher from the Peterson International Institute of Economics.
The U.S. economy is performing relatively well, and trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet in the process of revitalising the economy, creating a small amount of inflation.
The Fed, however, cannot ignore the less promising global painting.
It warned markets against an increase, but there are indications that they believe the situation will not allow such an increase.
The decision will be announced Thursday at 8:00 p.m.
The perpetrator of the murder at Delta State University left a letter of apology
On Tuesday, officials said, Shannon Lamb left a note in Mississippi Monday morning after killing her girlfriend with a gun and later that same day saying she was "sorry" for the first murder before killing her colleague, and wishing "if I could take it back."
Mississippi Gautier police said Lamb, a geographical and social science training instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10:00 p.m.
He said he said he shot and killed Monday.
Lamb said he had to send the police to the officer on the phone.
Lamb, who said, "I killed my wife last night," also stated that there was a "sweet dog that never hurt anyone" in the house and that he was probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't mention his name.
Lamb didn't give any explanation for the murder.
When the police went to the scene, he encountered the lifeless body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note written by 45-year-old Lamb: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could turn back time.
I loved Amy so much, and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After Lamb wrote this note, he drove his vehicle to Delta State, 300 miles away, killing history professor Ethan Schmidt, who then committed suicide when the police cornered him.
College Dean William LaForge stated that he did not know that there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "it was obvious that Lamb had some things on his mind."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb believed his girlfriend Prentiss was also having an emotional relationship with Schmidt, officials said Tuesday that they had "no information or evidence" that there was a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for nearly seven years, describes Prentiss as a "good guy".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but their friendship lasted.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss had found a 19-year-old daughter and that she was "in a state of ruin".
O'Steen also stated that Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends with each other".
Linsday Knowless, whom the Sun Herald described as a close friend of Parentiss, stated, was working online from his Prentiss home.
Knowles said Prentiss, a hunting dog owner named Lightning, had been with Lamb for nearly three years.
"He always liked to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives on Monday, saying, "I'm not going to jail."
That same night, when the police got close to him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled over, jumped on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself by shooting himself with a gun.
According to the University's CV published on its website, Lamb had received a PhD in education at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars lost their old charms
The actor (left) who was seen with his son Redmond (right) had quite a stressful few years.
He struggled with leukemia in 2001, while in 2009 he sacrificed his life partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor, who was also said to have been fighting drugs, was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
Of course, all this has done him a lot of harm.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United has been out for months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two fractures in Manchester United's defeat to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
This incident, which tears the defender, leaves him out of the field for at least six months, while Louis van Gaal remains hopeful that Shaw may return to the field this season.
The break was caused by a careless attempt with Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute of the game when 20-year-old Shaw dropped like a bomb on the playing field.
For nine minutes, he was intervened in the field and then needed oxygen before being transported to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture in his leg and he's in the hospital."
He'll be shipped out today or a day from now, and he'll be operating in Manchester.
It sucks -18-year-old transfer to Manchester, let him have a hard time, and then you have a great game, and then this happens to him.
When he was in the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on his face.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, that means at least six months, and that means you can't play in the group stage.
I'm hoping he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to get away with a red card and a penalty shot.
Umpire Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official made a mistake.
When I say it's a penalty and a red card, you can judge yourself.
It was a terrible battle with two legs.
The tweet in Shaw's account said, "Thank you all for your messages, not enough words to tell you how disappointed I am, my path to recovery is starting now, and I will return with strength."
Related: Luke Shaw suffers the shock of his injury in Manchester United PSV defeat
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, will be morale for the recovery of the British defender.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a very bad injury."
If an injury like this happens to any player, everyone will be upset.
Our players never intended to maim their opponent.
Moreno also had a leg fracture while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
He finds it very difficult because his intention was never to maim his opponent, and after hearing that it was a very bad break, he said, it was never good.
In my case, I couldn't see that moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball going in a different direction, like Moreno had touched it, but I couldn't see Luke strutting.
SBS 6 said in a statement Moreno: "I know what it feels like. I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel so bad about this, and I'm so sorry.
He had been hospitalized as a result of a struggle with Chris Smalling in Andrés Guardado of PSV.
Of course David Cameron knows The Lorax better than that?
It's something that every parent soon learns: when your child loves a book, you know it won't take you long to learn it almost by heart.
Apparently, if you're not David Cameron.
When asked by a holiday programmer supplier for child care what his favorite children's book was, the prime minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss' 1971 environmental tale.
Cameron, who wrote on the SuperCamps company's website that this was a difficult decision, said: "I like to read this book to my children, since it contains an image or message that we've always missed in its content, which is a funny, impressive, creative and powerful message."
So far everything was going very well, until Cameron wrote something about the content of the book, supposedly, but actually summed up the paragraph summarizing the 2012 film version of the book, where new characters and details were added to inflate the content of the original story text.
In Thneed-Ville, the city, where all nature is destroyed, even the air is meta, a boy named Ted writes that the girl in his dreams wants to fulfill his desire to see a real tree to win Audrey's heart, including a love tale that Dr. Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, did not know.
If this doesn't strike you as suspicious enough, it is very similar to the short summary text of The Lora film in the Internet Film Archive, which Cameron discussed, which begins with: "In Thneed-Ville, the city where everything is artificial and even air is a meta, a child's dream girl named Ted wants to win Audrey's heart."
According to Cameron's claims that he is a competent parent, it seems unlikely that the local community of an unnamed young boy, named Lorax, was aware of the motherly nature of the book, which he heard of, despite objections from the small, moustached, and "talking on behalf of trees" creature, was cut down, cut down by trees, by the lament-e.g. Once-ler.
It's likely that such a weak PR job has been transferred to an orderly, who apparently hasn't read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A lady from the presidential spokesperson said the text was thought to have come from Cameron's electoral office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was supplied from Cameron's staff, but did not comment otherwise.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of Britain's extraction, but he's still intact.
Playing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the British team selected for the tour, I don't think there's a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeats last time.
Still, I'm not leaving an away win out of the question.
Alastair Cook's team may be more inexperienced than it was three years ago, but they have players spinning well in the batting line, and his collective sense of play is also strong; these do not heal 2012's wounds, providing only a little youth-induced optimism.
In the game with the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a game rotator and Fair Rashid represents an attack option, even though the quality of the trial level is unknown.
Related: Adam Lyth quits the UK Trial Team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to remove Adam Lyth is a difficult decision for me to analyze as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His Seven Trials were against two good attacks in difficult circumstances, and the simple but inevitable fact is that cricketers are judged according to the outcome.
For example, there were no question marks about Joe Root, who had to be made public because -- as I said before -- players were their own best choices.
After several fifty-point series, Lyth could see his career extend, but he set his own fate.
I'm hoping if he works harder for Yorkshire, he'll get another chance.
UK head coach Trevor Bayliss praised the player's attitude, although he did not perform his best, which did not surprise me; first of all, he is a team man.
It's hard to answer a question about how long it's gonna take for a test batsman to get his grade.
Lyth - like Sam Robson before him - took seven caps, on the other hand Nick Compton took nine.
Only Compton had a chance at a rematch.
The only pain you can feel for Jonathan Trott may be that England goes to the Caribbean first - while Lyth's form is at its peak - but this wasted opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and I think he's a high-level hitter.
He's an X-factory cricketer, and we saw this in Yorkshire when he scored 236 against us on the Trent Bridge field earlier this season.
At least it needs to be taken for the same opportunity as before, but of course it depends on the formation of a team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen taking the opening shot next to Cook to get an extra game spinner while holding four fists worked, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why a batsman can't pitch here, and this left tackle has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen might not have done his job for the city of Worcestershire, but he saw a number three for them, and it's not that different.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests in his first fall before starting his 2001 debut.
Three hundred of them quickly picked up the series and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari is coming to the team as a backup game-turner, and he surprised me as an impressive young man in my limited negotiations with him.
People can see their raw statistics -- 31 averages in batting and 35 averages in ball -- and think it's a degage, but there are not many game spinners who raise their hands, and player choices were made in favor of the younger one.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the team, England seems to have made a few subtle additions to its own coaching team.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the Test matches may be a masterful precaution.
He's one of the loveliest men in that game; he'll bring with him a lot of experience, in any case, and a lot of experience that's been acquired against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball leg of the tour and gives both energy and game order a brutal streak.
I always thought he was born for the international cricket world, whether he was a player or a coach, and he has a sense of guidance like Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they deliver messages that have been said before, can bring an innovation to the team.
Colly's teammate Ben Stokes from Durham is being rested for one day games, Root has been given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, plans are not made by trainers and those who choose players.
And you must remember, like the actors, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
Brexit could win camp if the economy is still by 2017
David Cameron's half-baked re-negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and that is so, despite Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corbyn being elected Labour leader or TUC being outraged about Europe on Tuesday.
Strangers have Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
Recently, a European diplomat told me that some member states are tired of Britain's agenda of self-involved divisional concessions and disruptive treaty changes, many of which they don't want in the EU, which are completely overwhelmed by crises that they themselves don't.
The TUC decided in its annual meeting in Brighton that if it damaged social protection, it did not want them.
In fact, it's Dave and George's own agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in the capitals of foreign countries and take pictures of themselves in front of the famous monuments there, whether or not they're in front of them, then go back to their countries and say they're gathering allies for reform.
This is all about me.
When Berlin said, "Don't leave us alone with France", my European friend, who wanted an extroverted Britain within the EU tent, said that in some capitals, more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to a point where they don't care whether we stay or not.
Angela Merkel, Germany's prudent and sane chancellor, is an ally, though she has been in power for 10 years, and thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) wants to leave power before the situation gets worse.
François Hollande faces reelection or change of power in France in 2017.
It's a fading force.
Soon, a nationalist government from the right will come to power in Poland and a left-wing government from Spain.
It's unlikely for the Selfie Britons who should use their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom that these countries will make an effort because they don't want it either because most of them have separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers, in the Scottish National Party style, may be planning to speed up the Brexit process by making deliberate statements that would not help this situation during the United Kingdom's 2017 referendum campaign; my friend says so.
"Re-negotiation was not a dead end" and "Britain has achieved nothing to benefit from re-negotiation."
Europeans know from their previous experience how exploitative, oligarchical press barons of Fleet Street were EU dissidents because they were not like that at the time of Tony Benn, they inspired the 1975 referendum that approved our entry in 1973, at a rate of 2 to 1.
This is how they remember Boris Johnson, the lead Euro-portunist, who was a Brussels correspondent in the early '90s, who made his name known as "EU flat bananas".
Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were, aside from all his foolishness.
Among them were anti-tax thugs, foreigners listening to illegal phones, and so-called foreign residents who had most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair often felt the same way about them, but when he was trapped in a cage with a horny gorilla, he realized that he had to distract him by giving him a banana so that he wouldn't be eaten at lunch and teatime.
In fact, Miliband was Blairist as well, in terms of opposing Cameron's brilliant idea of a referendum, as Blair had compromised the principle on the EU constitution, which was cancelled in 2005 by French and Dutch voters who gave him an exit card.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on my friendly back in Westminster on Monday -- who I told him he no longer had time to lose -- seems to be in danger of Neil Kinnock re-admitting the boycott strategy of the '80s Murdoch, which was then and now a mistake.
Although it will take time, he needs to develop a consistent strategy to communicate with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC seat in particular on Sunday, not with me.
I hereby state Corbyn's official position in Europe in development.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of the people outside Ukip's hostile tendency and the ardent supporters of Conservative Little England say yes.
Already, that's what Hilary Benn, "A Benn but not a Bennite", said on radio and on television this week, as she was naively forced herself not to admit that it was a bad idea for Corbyn to appoint John McDonnell as shadow chancellor.
This reminded me of his father's struggle with infidelity to his fellow workers' cabinet on television in the '70s, not going too far, and losing his position in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But "With Benn's testimony - fighting to stay "under any circumstances" was the same as what McDonnell had said or what JC had told the lords to MPs at the special meeting on Monday night.
Considering that he touched me, from the detail that Corbyn is trying to convey, to the gene, no matter what dazzled image, the message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV, and especially in the social media vortex, which is a bed of paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it's reasonable to give Cameron a hard time with Europe, which guarantees Labour support in the referendum.
That's exactly what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's transitions in line with the Bennite siege economy and anti-capitalist backgrounds on EU membership are no longer a subjectary debate between left wing opponents, who are only the cornerstones of the teaching snarls of small difference narcissism.
As with his passing on Nato - Tom Watson is determined that JC will not campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will have to try to make a sense of them for their masters in their country.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital on concessions to Britain, where they can all go to waste, when they have their own skeptical voters?
As I was told at the British Impact Safety Forum opening on Monday, the United States is already very disappointed by its poor minimum performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the ruling cost-reduction Conservative Party government.
Experts criticise UK Public Health e-smoking research
Researchers have stated that e-smoking is 95% less harmful than smoking at a 12-person meeting, conducted by a government-funded agency, with those connected to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Journal of Medicine (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing evidence that the UK Public Health (PHE) used in its report on e-sigara.
PHE released its report last month as a "return point", which it described as "a thorough examination of the diamonds".
But some researchers questioned the integrity of the data and noted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The Lancet medical journal's editorial last month targeted "extraordinaryly rotten foundation" based on PHE's main result.
Two other researchers writing at BMJ questioned whether the allegations were "built on the sand or on the rock".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policies are based on evidence of activity."
They said the public's claims that the PHE is "about 95% less harmful than smoking e-smoking according to the current best estimate" would be in anticipation that the evidence and modeling would be based on a detailed review.
In fact, a multi-critical decision analysis (MCDA) to create a synthesis of their views on various products containing this nicotine emerges from a 12-person meeting to develop the model; the results of the meeting are summarized in a research article.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting, the general manager, was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was previously reported to have received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent research.
They also said in a sustainability report that the BAT approved the public health promotion document.
They added that one of the 12 people at the meeting had reported receiving funds from an e-smoking manufacturer, but that this was not the funds previously reportedly received from the Philip Morris International cigarette company.
No information was given on how panel members were elected, but these include some known giants of e-smoking in which some reported industry funding in the article.
Others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The person in charge of tobacco attended the meeting at PHE.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the group's research article, "effectively", admitted that it was "a lack of concrete evidence about the damages of most products according to many criteria."
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said the allegations that "there is no evidence that e-smoking is a transition to smoking for children or non-smoking people are too early."
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and welfare at PHE, said the allegations at BMJ had been answered earlier.
He said, "E-smoking is significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifetime smokers dies of this addiction.
All the evidence points to a small amount of health risks caused by e-smoking, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty: to inform the public of what evidence shows and does not show at a time when there is much confusion about its damages, especially when compared with tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die of a smoking-related disease a year, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
We do our national responsibility by making it clear that the existing evidence -- although e-smoking is not risk-free -- carries only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking.
Previous Channel 4 chief said the BBC should drop EastEnders
Previous Channel 4 president Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop airing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and stated that advertising competitors could "give their right arm" for hit shows such as Albert Square shows.
Johnson said the licensing fee should only be used to make programs that were not made by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs on channels such as BBC4, which are likely to be monitored by a smaller audience, against their opponents' most ratings-field programs at valuable intervals.
After Tony Hall, the BBC's general director, said the institution wanted to cooperate more with other organizations; Johnson said that this had been unsuccessfully tried for six years in his own time on Channel 4 to form a link with the BBC.
During an interrogation of the BBC's future, Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee, "I am struggling with the idea of the BBC ordering and publishing programs that can be shown openly by non-subsidised opponents."
If you continue to apply the licensing fee, which I am not sure is a good idea in the middle or long term, its output must be reduced to programs that others do not or order at least.
He broadcasts The Voice in the primetime range because they want to provide as much support as possible for the future.
The idea here is based on the idea that no one else is going to publish it, which is ridiculous and clearly ridiculous.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why programs that can be funded without help should be funded by a reduced-rate tax.
The Voice is one EastEnders is another, and it's actually being done within the company.
To be honest, other channels give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see what public service broadcasts are like.
I don't think that's going to diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series of entrepreneurs who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings "for the passion of the people who work here and for seeing this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support".
BBC's comments on its most popular programs repeat comments by previous Sky administrator Tony Ball, who used the MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell their programs like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's more appropriate public service programs went to BBC4, where audience measurement could not be done, but that they covered tax amnesty and could argue to continue their demonstrative duty of piety about providing ground for £4 billion in licensing fee revenue, and added: "Of course we are doing all these silt programs that no one has ever seen."
They put them in spaces no one will ever see.
About the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: "I invite you to find a more regressive system in terms of those who provide the best benefit from it.
Of course you're all thinking, we're all thinking, £150 a year is a big deal, but I'm wondering if it's because they don't watch a lot of BBCs for people where £150 is a lot of money.
David Elstein, the previous Sky and Channel 5 administrator who also presented evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise the Reithian mission to "information, educate and entertain".
He said that some of the BBC's output was now officially classified as education - this is 1.1% of the TV output and 0.1% of the radio - and that public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should be the forerunner to it, and that this should be changed to "information, lighting and training".
In terms of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC needs to engage with advertising broadcasters to do something on TV about Proms, which are only shown a handful, and to ensure that they are all monitored online.
'Sonogenetic' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how threadworms change direction the moment they're hit by sound vibrations.
Scientists have grown maggots with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by soundwave bursts.
Tiny threadworms change direction as soon as they're hit by sound vibrations at a high level that people can't hear.
Vibrations are activated by genetically modified motor nerve cells to carry membrane channels that respond to trans-sound waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said the maggots prove the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics; thus an ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Researcher Sreekanth Chalasani of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an interventionist procedure that gives electrical vibrations inside people's brains to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms.
The threadworms often do not respond beyond sound, but Chalasani found that they reacted when surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles it finds strengthen the intra-sound waves, allowing them to pass through the maggots.
Reinforced trans-sound waves affect structures found in the membranes of some worm cells called TRP-4 ion channels.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are connected to.
To create threadworms controlled by the audio, Chalasani genetically modified the maggots to allow some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When you applied it to the altered creatures, the sound waves were powered by micro-cabarics and transmitted into the maggots, where the modified engine activated the neurons.
This procedure has similarities to optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to run and shut down neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says sonogenetics may have some advantage over this technique.
Unlike the light that should be sent along an optical fiber to the desired point within the brain, low-frequency trans-sound waves can pass through the tissue unimpeded, thus sending them over the skull into the brain.
Chalasani said, "We believe that using gene therapy and a curative virus, human neurons targeted in the clinical environment for specific neurological treatments can be temporarily made sensitive to the trans-sound signal."
He added that other applications can be concentrated on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment-- right on your doorstep!
Advertisements condemn Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms Fair Video.
Terrible killer drones!
The shackles that broke your ankle!
Participated bombs!
And electric-shocked batons that cause severe pain but leave no trace!
The fine audio and cartoon footage produced for Amnesty International, prepared to highlight the British government's desire to sell weapons to oppressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCel Center at London Dockyard, leaves no doubt that the world's largest weapons fair is a sharp hoax.

A different campaign, however, continues with posters on bus stops and subway trains, requiring looking twice.
In one, the London Metro uses its fonts and brand to turn the DLR line into a tank, saying, "The important announcement is, are you going to travel in the DLR from September 15th to September 18th?"
This September, a pack of arms dealers will attack the DLR... and customers will be asked to help stop this arms fair.
300 posters are from artists who exhibit works at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Bansky's Dismaland.
A collective, called the Special Patrol Group, helped distribute it using "The Impact Packages to the Advertising Area", which was £6 and claimed that "it gave access to about a third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet".
Transport for London was not pleased with this poster of "vandalism".
One of the ads was created by the Special Patrol group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and professor of the University of Essex, artists are becoming more and more interrogative every day and are looking for ways to move political affairs to the masses outside the galleries.
Many artists act within protest movements with activists and begin to realize that their art has to come out into the real world to have an impact on society.
Another anti-weapons trade poster also appears in front of the commuters on the subway.
Amnesty International's video was viewed over 100,000 times over Facebook within 24 hours and created by the free-working VCCP advertising agency, and they also produced the graphic designer and the sound artist for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was very surprised by the silence against gun fair advertisements—with empty space in the ExCel calendar—and thought, "Let's offer them a campaign where they're trying to escape."
They played with the idea of doing a more realistic, cunning corporate advert, but "they decorated it with bright colors and animation, more remarkable."
Tom Davies of Amnesty said: "They have been very helpful to us in creating concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment in the Fuar."
What we need now is for the UK government to act and prevent torture equipment from being sold illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art at the arms fair comes from the inside ExCel, where exhibitors sell fantastic cover-up products.
In a press release, Saab showed the order of the U.S. military "AT4CS RS launched from our shoulder".
It's got a "like-formed warhead that hits a big blow through the armor to the target."
Whatever he's doing, it's not gonna be nice.
Eight golden rules of living in student homes
It's been 11 years since I moved into student dorms as an indifferent 19-year-old, and I still believe in berets and moral relativity, but now I remember the fake smiles of those I disturb - and their numerous long complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight golden rules.
Moving home can be traced from annoying to absolutely terrifying.
Temptation of chatter: where you're from, where you've lost years, where you've insisted on Corbyn, and why you're obviously "not loving or hating Marmite, because really, gentlemen, that's just yeast extract. I'll be in my room."
Take a breath.
And let the others have one - ask questions and show interest.
It will direct this conversation and help you separate what you like from people you don't want to talk to, even if your eyelashes are on fire and they're spraying fire extinguishers.
Leave some space for the people.
People's rooms often turn into liquor receptions, movie night venues, and community hangouts, but these are also places where people dress up and arrange their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting college with a relationship
Introverts get treated badly in college.
Your room may be a seclusion, but many dorm corridors develop inter-room dating culture, and this is friendly, social, and lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who's trying to store energy.
Nothing in culture will let you say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away for a while so I can put back the energy I spent communicating with you."
Try to sense that a friend is tired of socializing and maybe text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A friend at the student hostel had a policy that he was invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a lot of things.
Don't make friends through cooking.
Since you started college at the peaks of the food competition craze, it will be less awkward and less 1950s to introduce yourself by knocking on people's doors with a plate of brownies, and "Welcome to our neighborhood, I've cooked you something, now smile while I ask you personal questions."
Giving people homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates might feel compelled to talk, and maybe they'll tie your face to a sweet surprise.
Frankly, this is about you being a master cook.
A lumpy lump of dough, sugar and oil that isn't well mixed, will make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
To be honest, it's stealing from someone's chicken, but buying a few drops of milk for your tea?
Check the milk owner twice.
He'll probably tell you to take care of yourself even if he's swimming in it.
It's very uncomfortable for someone to steal their stuff, and I understand you-- but try to deal with it more maturely than my dorm mate, who put liquid soap in order to punish the person who stole his milk.
He's in jail now.
Do not make noise in a way that prevents people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent person, but because you're people in glass houses.
A girl in my hallway told her neighbor to step on her next door and cut the drums a little bit because it's 3:00 in the morning and she has her morning exam.
Their answer was to turn it up even more.
When they finally closed at 5:00 a.m., the girl kindly allowed them to sleep for two hours before opening her own music and locking the door, before going to her own three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic for your future wife to move into the same hallway as you?
Wouldn't it be weird if, on the contrary, you misunderstood a fellow hallway mate and thought you were your future wife, and you had to hang out and see her every day and watch your mutual friends being taken prisoner?
Of course that's the heart, but if your hot hallway neighbor is definitely not your future wife, at least talk to the little guy and advise him of common sense.
When you realize at a cheerful moment that someone left their keys unlocked, know that the line between joking and abusing someone is thinner than you think.
A good joke is fun, but it'll take time to get back.
You can teach someone a valuable and fun lesson in security by hiding their things-- but never dirty someone's room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and put your keys in the freezer in a glass of water, but don't put your things on the ceiling more than twice.
Speaker of parliament of immigrant origin in the Netherlands
Arib won the highest vote in the fourth round of yesterday's election, becoming the first mayor of Dutch immigrant origin.
Arib, who also has Moroccan citizenship, will assume the post until 2017.
Arib also ran for president in 2012 in parliament, where he served as MP since 1998, but was not elected.
A surprise suitor for Hope Cloud!
The final offer came from Eskişehirspor to Hope Cloud, whose star did not make up with G.SARAY fans and who suffered a demoralization due to protests by the stands in recent matches.
He missed this position, wanted out of the game!
During Ryan Donk's transfer, Eskişehirspor made the final step for the national goaltender, which Kasimpaşa also wanted to include in his squad.
However, the red blacks were answered negatively by the G.Saray administration.
His heart stopped while he was getting prettier.
Raquel Santos (28), the mother of two children who lived at RIO DA JANEIRO, applied to her plastic doctor last Monday to remove traces of laughter on the mouth margins.
After a while, the woman who had been injected with filling material in her face accelerated her heart rate and breathing.
Then he died of cardiac arrest.
Police are investigating whether he was involved in the death of the drug "Potenay", which she uses daily.
The real cause of death will be revealed after the autopsy.
Debora Azevedo, one of the model's closest friends, told the Brazilian press that Santos, one 7 and two sons aged 13, was obsessed with plastic surgery.
Santos, who joined Musa do Brasil from Brazil's most important beauty pageants last December, came in second.
Oil companies are officially down.
From 2014, when oil prices began to drop, nearly $400 billion of investment was delayed by the end of last year, while deep-sea (deepwater) oil exploration projects were suspended most.
According to the research of advisory company Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices have caused the suspension of the $380 billion project in oil and gas exploration/production, while millions of barrels of production from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa has also been delayed in a wide geography.
As the biggest cause of cost cuts, the report shows oil prices falling to the lowest level in 12 years, losing 70 per cent in 1.5 years while at $115 in the summer of 2014, adding that "the company budgets have dramatically narrowed down".
400 MILLION DOLLARS IN THE SOLDIER
While crude oil prices made new surprises every day, last seen the lowest level in the past 12 years, it dropped below $30.
"Will the pedal drop to $15"; the research by energy consulting company Wood Mackenzie, now sparked debates on whether "Petrol is cheaper than water", reveals how the industry is affected by falling prices.
Finally, in July, Wood Mackenzie revealed that the falling oil prices caused the suspension of 46 major energy investments of $200 billion, revealing where that number reached by the end of 2015 in his new research.
Accordingly, 22 other major projects have been delayed in the last six months of 2015, while 68 major projects have been suspended in total since 2014, when the oil collapse began.
These projects are worth about $400 billion.
DAY 2.9 MILLION
The study stressed that the impact of low oil prices on company plans is "neutral", noting that the most affected projects are deep-sea development projects.
Suspended projects correspond to a total of 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent reserves, while up to 2025 2.9 million barrels of oil per day were delayed.
According to the study, the final investment decision of most of the projects was postponed to 2017 and after, while the initial production goals shifted between 2020 and 2023.
"The majority of $170 billion is deep-sea projects," the report stressed, highlighting that 68 projects delayed include a potential $170 billion investment projected to take place in the next five years.
And that's because the cost of pre-investment is too high.
"70 per cent of deep-sea spending is primarily made up of oil-weight projects in Nigeria, Angola and the US Gulf of Mexico".
According to the study, countries with the most delayed oil project inventory are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have almost 90 percent of the delayed liquid (petrol) reserves.
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, countries with the largest number of delayed gas reserves, together totaling 85 per cent.
While much of the gas waiting to come out here is located in the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development solutions, such as installing a liquidated gas (LNG) plant from scratch.
The most endangered companies are said to be oil giants in the deep sea, Canadian oil sand and Caspian Region, with commitments that follow each other, while the companies are also trying to adapt to the "longer" oil price scenario.
EYES IN IRAN
About four years ago, there was a painting: The United States and Europe had brought embargo on Iranian oil to stop Tehran's nuclear program, the barrel price of oil was about $110, and there was debate about how Iranian oil exports would be trapped without causing a sudden leap in prices.
And when we get back this week, we see a whole new scenario.
Oil prices saw under $30 for the first time since 2004, which was mainly due to a production boom in the United States, and embargos imposed on Iran are lifted.
That's why the eyes are on Iran.
If Iran increases oil exports, more oil will flow into the oil market, which is already said to be quite saturated.
This could lead to prices going below the levels that surprise us today.
Some analysts say Saudi Arabia, which does not want to lose market share to Iran, will pump even more oil, and there may be a price war between Iran and S. Arabia.
As soon as the sanctions are lifted, Iran's main target is recorded as former partners in Asia's rapidly growing oil market India and Europe.
Iranian officials had earlier said they were aiming to increase exports by 500,000 barrels per day in the first place and to release that much more after a while.
According to Reuters' map information, 22 of the very large crude oil carriers (VLCC) off the coast of Iran, at least 13 of them are fully or largely loaded.
Iran is the country with the fourth largest proven oil reserves in the world.
Thanks to the sanction exceptions, Iran is still exporting about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries, including Turkey.
Before the sanctions, Iran's daily oil exports had grown to 3 million barrels per day.
Support Securities Research Specialist Aysun Göksu answers the question if oil drops below $20: "China-based global growth concerns increase downward pressure on commodity prices, while the loss in oil prices deepens."
In China, the world's largest oil importer, we see that oil has reached 20 per cent of losses since New Year's, with concerns that the demand for oil will be reduced in parallel to economic slowdown.
In addition, with the dollar gaining global value and the impact of the global supply surplus problem, we can witness prices of less than $30 in oil in the coming days.
As long as we don't see permanent pricing on 32 to 33 dollar levels, the movement of rise in oil can be limited and the downward pressure may increase.
At this point, it can be said that the sighting of closures under the critical $30 level has a key role for the declines to continue.
In such a situation, it should not be a surprise to see reliefs in the lower half, up to 23.30 to 25.60.
Isham Sardouk: 'The Angel era is over!'
Why did you turn the route to Turkey when you took up the role of trending creativity at Victoria's Secret and WGSN, which set the trends of fashion of the world?
- I'm always for change.
I was born in Paris, I lived in London, then I went to New York.
I took important positions there, too.
Meanwhile, I've been consulting Koton for the last two years.
Then I saw the potential in this geography and the Koton brand.
I realized you had everything you needed to become a department store chain in the world.
Now I'm here to make it happen.
Are you going to make it soon?
- Absolutely.
Even though it's a young brand, it's already being sold in 50 countries.
We make 50 collections a year, there are 15 separate sections.
So there's everything a chain of stores should have.
From Dubai to Moscow we are able to respond to the needs of consumers in different geography.
Now we open a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting era...
Is it necessary to open a store in Paris?
- Yeah.
Not because Europe's economic situation is great.
But you open some stores for image.
In fashion capitals like Paris, London, you get a store, you get money from the Middle East.
One adds prestige to the brand, the other adds money, both essential for a brand that plays globally.
So let's talk trends...
- We have a very romantic, elegant season ahead of us.
Flying chiffon dresses, soft tones, pinks, whites, reds.
Patterns...
We're going through a very difficult and cruel time, and the fashion world is always trying to add a little bit of happiness to life by carrying elegant, refreshing designs to the podium during these difficult times.
That's what we're doing.
That's why the "age of grace" is coming back in the new season.
Let's go back to your years at Victoria's Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel?
I'm not just talking about your magnificent physique: she's so positive, she's so good!
He used to sit next to me while I was working, feeding me apples and stuff, like, "Honey, are you hungry?"
That's how sweet it was.
You know what I'm talking about. I looked into it. You interviewed all the Victoria's Secret models.
Isn't Karolina beautiful?
But Adriana Lima impressed me with her beauty.
- Say yes, that voice!
That speech, that tone...
You get nervous after a while, and you're like, "Sit down and look beautiful, and don't do anything else!"
It brings nerves.
That's right. Shocks like this happen.
I interviewed Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen, but I was terrified of her empty head.
- That's most of it now.
The new angels aren't what they used to be...
I remember Gisele's time.
It was hard to work with him, though.
He'd come backstage, smoke like a chimney.
Not that you're a smoker.
He's the only one who can drink.
It's just to be a diva.
The Victoria's Secret show, published two months ago, received the lowest ratings in its history.
Why do you think?
- Like I said, it's over with those legendary angels.
I'm sorry. Who needs Gigi Hadid?
What's so good about it?
Kendall Jenner, like wood.
There's no curve, there's nothing.
Kate Moss's curves were zero, but she became the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but what a pretty face she had.
I'd like to take advantage of my objection here.
I interviewed him last year, and his face was pretty messed up...
- All this smoking, drinking, and now it's ugly.
But he had such a beautiful face in the '90s.
His lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
He was at the end of that supermodel era.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington.
Christy was my next door neighbor, and I saw her every morning without makeup.
Such beauty cannot be such grace.
What about Cara Delevingne?
- He's wasting himself.
It's not every campaign.
People are getting sick of it.
There's no hunger for famous models, celebrities, like there used to be.
People like themselves want to see real faces in campaigns.
That's what we're gonna do.
Because that's the trend.
Turkish letter from 25 authors
According to BBC Turkish, authors including the presidents of the International Writers' Association (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland have stated that threats and physical attacks targeting colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey have become a normal part of life.
The letter included two attacks targeting the daily Hurriyet in Turkey, the Koza group raid, and the detention of Vice News reporters, and the investigations and arrests against journalists were also among the alarming developments.
The mother's half-working rights were controversial.
Turkish-Business "We think that mothers have been given half a right to work so that rent labour can be restored."
"This could be a Trojan horse", said TİSK, "We are concerned if this arrangement will stop women from working."
The new rights, which were planned to be brought to civil servants and workers after birth or adoption, passed through the commission with all-day talks.
The most common topic on the agenda was "rential labor" in commission talks of regulations that brought up six months of postpart-time work or free leave, and part-time work until the child reached elementary school age.
CHP İzmir MP Musa Çam stated that it is correct to have partial work done by the time the child goes to elementary school, but that they are experiencing some concerns. "If you bring the rental labour arrangement behind this, we will be against it until the end," said CHP İzmir MP Musa Pine.
"We have doubts as to how to replace the female employee in the part-time work," Enis Bağdadioglu, who participated in the commission talks on behalf of Turkey-Business, said.
"This is why we will watch the developments regarding private employment offices with concern," he said.
"This long-term partial work is not in other countries," TİSK Secretary General Bülent Pirler stated, stating that partial work was brought by law for five years."
Look at it this way.
He said, "It is also necessary to consider the consequences of this practice in places with 1 or 2 employees."
ToBB Adviser Ahmet Şağar also said that if the practice is to live, it will be difficult to find workers.
According to Shağar, there is no legislation regarding the rules to be implemented in part-time work, he said, “A compromise should be reached between workers and employers who come up with regulations regarding private employment offices.
Metin Feyzioğlu: We do not support
Feyzioğlu's statement reads: "We do not agree with this statement, we cannot participate and support it."
Because there's no criticism of the PKK.
You couldn't say a word negative to the PKK, to the separatist terrorist organization, you didn't put any dust on it.
Only and only the heavy statements against the state, we don't consider them serious, and we don't find them sincere, taking into account those who spend them.
We're lawyers, we're lawyers.
If those who represent the state, the public officials, the security forces have anything illegal to do with this framework, let's follow it.
When we say, "Don't tear down the state", looking at the dividers or dividers with sympathy, romanticizing the remnants of the conflict period, they attack us as "Disruptive, fascist."
When we say, "This state must act in accordance with the law, always uphold the law," they say, "You are divisive."
We're the bridge.
We're always obliged to tell the truth.

Who Is Bergen?
Bergen, whose real name was Belgin Hugsier, was born on 16 July 1960 in Mersin.
With the divorce of his parents, he and his mother Sebahat Çakır settled in Ankara in 1966.
Yenimahalle entered the Ankara State Conservatory Piano section after Yunus Emre Primary School, but he left due to financial difficulties and worked at PTT for a while, enhancing his age.
In 1979, after appearing on stage at the Feynman Night Club, where he went to have fun with his friends, he accepted his offer to work.
He performed with the Group Locomotive orchestra at the Feyman Night Club with repertoires of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and then-fashion arrangements.
After Ankara, Bergen went to Adana for business, where he met Halis Serbes and married a year later.
In 1982, he released his first longpla, "I Have a Complaint" from Atlas Records.
Having been unable to bear the violence of her husband while his output in art life continued, Bergen escaped from his wife on many occasions.
In October 1982, while working in Izmir, she was thrown in the face by her husband's insistence.
In this attack, Bergen, who lost one eye and burned most of the body, was persuaded and performed by Genghis Özekeker, the composer of the song "Who Knows?", which famously made Celebrity after treatment.
Performing at the Izmir Diamond Pavilion, owned by Özekeker until 1985, he and his boss produced a demo tape called "Brother Destiny" and sent it to Yasar Kekeva.
Liked Bergen, Kekeva invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist, who released his first professional longplay in the Istanbul music market, "Human Severse", under Burhan Bayar's musical direction, became famous for his "Woman of Pain" in late 1986.
With the album much appreciated, she was awarded the Gold Record and Gold Tape by her record label in April 1987, with the title "1986 Album The Most Selling Arabesque Female Artist".
In the same year, he came on camera with Yalçın Gülhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron in the film "Woman of Pain" with the screenplay and directorship of Ulku Erakalın.
Having acquired a large fan base, Bergen survived a knife attack in Adana, where he went for the concert at the last minute.
Leaving the stage for a period, he released the albums "Burn Him, Lord", "The Price of Love" and "I Don't Want", respectively, in the directories of great masters Salami Şahin, Azer Şenay and Genghis Tekin.
Bergen, who also officially divorced her husband in April 1989, made her return to the scenes in June 1989, with her last album, "Years Unforgiving", while she was alive.
The artist, who began the promotional tours of the album, received with intense interest, was shot dead by his wife, whom he divorced at Adana Pozanti on the night of August 14, 1989, connecting August 15.
He was buried in his hometown of Mersin.
Bergen fitted a video with 5 longplays and 129 songs on 11 tapes to his 29-year short life.
Claims that the artist, who had signed the arabeske with his different and strong voice, had become legendary, gained accuracy as the album "I'm Gone Youth", released following his death, ran out from day one.
Bergen's officially released studio albums:
1982 – Complaint I Have LP (1986 reprinted as MC.)
1983 – Brother Destiny is reprinted as LP (1985 and 1990 as MC.)
1985 – Human Severse LP, MC (reprinted as CD in 1999.)

Nazim Hikmet was mentioned on his 114th birthday
Nazim Hikmet Ran, known as the Home Poet, was credited with the "Happy Birthday Nazim" event in the 114th year of his birth.
The event, organised by the Municipality of Konak, took place at the Bezelian Cultural Center in the hall where the poet was named.
At the event, poetry and music were performed by the famous poet's poems, theatre and film actor Rüştu Asian.
He also accompanied Asian at the event with comments from the Three Anatolian Music Society.
Nazim Hikmet accompanied many art lovers.
These names included Ali Electoral Recipient, Erkoç Grandson, Nedim Star and Zeynep Gölnur Star and Ziya Özsökmen.
In Istanbul, the event was organised by the Nazim Hikmet Foundation for Culture and Art.
Foundation President Rutkay Aziz and members met in Tarabya for the event, the daughter, son-in-law and grandson of Nâzim Hikmet's wife Vera Tulyakova, actress Tariq Akan.
He will recite poems and leave carnations in the sea with the slogan "Live like a tree, one and free / And like a forest, brotherly".
The event, organised by the City of Sarıyer, will be accompanied by songs by the Songs of the Council of Wisdom.
Nazim Hikmet was born on 15 January 1902.
The poems of the world-famous poet Nazim Hikmet were translated into more than 50 languages.
He was repeatedly arrested for his political thoughts and spent much of his adult life in prison or exile.
His poems have been translated into more than fifty languages and his works have received many awards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
Bursa Lotus Municipality did special work on the 114th birthday of the world-renowned poet Nazim Hikmet.
The municipality also issued a personal stamp for the poet for the first time in the history of Turkey, working on Nazim's 11-year documentary "The Nazimi of Bursa", describing Nazim's days at Bursa Prison.
Thus, in collaboration with PTT, the first personal stamp was issued on behalf of Nazim Hikmet in Turkey's history.
This special stamp, priced at $1.40, and first day envelopes will be presented to guests on Thursday (January 14th) at the Nazim Hikmet Culture House.
They'll be deported by bicycle
However, refugees, most of whom are Syrians, will have to pedal at minus 20 degrees this time and return to Russia, as no agreement has been reached between the two countries.
During the summer months, a group of refugees flew to Russia and moved north of the country from Murmansk to Norway on the grounds that it was safer and cheaper.
Since the agreement between the two countries did not allow them to cross the border on foot, immigrants had crossed the border on a bicycle.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
Therefore, Norwegian police instructed the repair of abandoned bicycles when crossing the border.
EU crisis of "3 billion euros to Turkey"
The crisis over 3 billion euros pledged to Turkey for refugees is ongoing.
European Union Commission President Jean Claude Juncker criticised Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's blocking of funding to be transferred to Turkey.
The mood between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good, Juncker said, stressing that the EU must find 3 billion euros.
"This money is not for Turkey but for Syrian refugees in Turkey."
We haven't reached 3 billion yet.
"This is a matter of EU reliability, therefore it is important," he said.
Juncker said he expected the money to be completed by January 26, the date previously given.
Italy is among the countries noted for its positive attitude when it comes to Turkey.
The position of Rome on the financial package is not directly a move towards Turkey and is linked to the problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some Union countries, diplomatic sources say.
There has been tension between Italy and the EU for some time.
Renzi continued to harshly criticize German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and the EU at the last EU summit on energy, banking and immigrants.
"Renzi must stop blaming the EU," Juncker said at yesterday's press conference, criticizing Renzi's stance.
"Renzi's, which I love very much, is wrong to insult the EU Commission at every turn," he said.
Juncker hinted that Renzi was playing for the public.
Of the 3 billion euros promised to Turkey, 1 billion will be covered from the EU budget.
The 2 billion euros will be due to member states' budgets.
Germany will contribute at least 427m euros.
Reporting that it will not transfer money to Turkey for political reasons, the Greek Administration has agreed to transfer its 2.3m euro-level source to the EU budget for use in support of Jordan and Lebanon.
The source is predicted to be used during the 2016-2017 period.
I cried when I saw the Charlie Hebdo cartoon.
Speaking to Russian official news agency Sputnik, father Abdullah Kurdi reacted harshly and said, "I cried for this cartoon if you wanted the truth."
He said, "I felt terrible."
Following his shooting, the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which became a symbol of freedom of expression, said Baba Kurdi, expressing that they expected positive things from Charlie Hebdo:
Unfortunately, they made a bad cartoon.
Everybody's really upset about this cartoon.
Aylan is a 2-year-old boy and he's dead.
Charlie Hebdo was supposed to respect Aylan, me and my family, but it was the other way around.
This is a magazine where a dead child should respect people.
They published a disrespectful cartoon about our Prophet.
They've even published literature on God.
It's a little thing done to my child against God and the Prophet.
Kurdi, who lived in Erbil, made the call: "My call to the whole world and to humor magazine, all children who have died must respect."
It should not upset their families, but it should not add pain to their suffering.
Aylan Kurdi's aunt, Tima Kurdi, who lived in Canada, was also one of those who reacted to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau, the signed cartoon implies that the 3-year-old Syrian Aylan Kurdi, who struck the lifeless body on the basement beach, could have been 'one of the harassers in Germany' when he grew up.
Last year, French humor magazine Charlie Hebdo, who was attacked by radical religious leaders for publishing cartoons, was again the focus of controversy over his cartoon about Aylan Kurdi.
The cartoon depicted abusers in the German city of Cologne, who, in the beginning of the New Year's celebration, were pig-faced and reminiscent of immigrants who chased women.
The cartoon that causes different reactions on social media is actually part of a four-square column.
It says "This is not France" on the colon, and according to many readings, it is criticised for increasing refugee hostility along with other lost values belonging to France.
On the other hand, the cartoon still led many to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
Charlie Hebdo magazine praised Germany, which also agreed to receive 800,000 refugees in a issue published last year, while criticizing France's reluctance to open its doors to immigrants.
The comic reads, "He was very close to his goal," and the ad said, "Two children's menus for the price of one."
'The autopsy on the Germans who died in Sultanahmet is in Germany'
The Federal Prosecutor's Office of Germany has decided to bring the bodies of 10 people who died in the attack to Germany, according to the weekly magazine Der Spiegel's website.
The funerals of the deceased will be met by a German Air Force plane today or tomorrow at the country and airport.
In Germany, experts from the Federal Criminal Office (BKA) task force go to countries where the incident occurred for German citizens who died in accidents or attacks under normal circumstances, where they do their identification and autopsy.
However, Der Spiegel magazine wrote that this time the situation would be different.
According to the magazine, officials from the Federal Criminal Office appealed to Turkish authorities for identification and autopsy of the dead in Istanbul, but Turkish authorities did not accept this proposal.
The Federal Criminal Office had sent four experts to Istanbul following the Istanbul attack.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are undergoing treatment at the hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood is dead.
Meiksins Wood, a well-known political theorist and socialist historian, had been in mind, especially with his significant work on the origins of capitalism.
The works of Latvian-born Meiksins Wood, born in New York City in 1942, also published in Turkish: Escape from the Class -- Archaic Culture of Capitalism -- Capitalism Against Democracy -- The Origin of Capitalism -- Capital Empire -- Return to Marx
No swimming pools for asylum seekers men
The municipality will lift the ban if social workers at home report that the message of the ban is understood by asylum seekers, German media reported.
In a statement to the WDR, social office official Markus Schnapka, who noted that the municipality does not want to punish the innocent for the behaviour of several people, said they inform the residents of the dorms in three languages about the values that are valued in Germany.
Schnapka noted that they did not discuss the gender equality value that Germany cares about, adding that the municipality would punish any attack and harassment.
On the other hand, the carnival parade was cancelled in Rheinberg due to the possibility that harassment scandals in Cologne would occur at the upcoming carnival parades.
The municipality has announced the cancellation of the carnival parade, as there is no guarantee of harassment.
What are the benefits of steam cooking?
A technique that doesn't kill vitamins and minerals in nutrients, steam cooking technique is becoming increasingly popular.
In steam, which has been one of the most preferred cooking techniques in the Far East for centuries, cooking makes metabolism stronger and easier to digest.
In this way, bacteria and microbes found in nutrients are also dying completely, which eliminates problems such as indigestion.
The protein in the food, cellulose and starch are completely melting with this technique, which makes the food softer.
In steam that takes place at low pressure, cooking is performed in a pot with the help of steam containers or steam machine.
At high pressure, the amount of water used in cooking and the amount of cooking time is short.
The best example of this is that cooking is shown in the pot.
To cook foods such as vegetables, particularly on diet menus, first you have to wash the vegetables thoroughly and then wait for them to glide well into the filter.
A deep pot is filled with one-third water and the steam filter is placed inside the pot.
The pot's mouth is left half closed.
This allows the steam to come out of the pot in peace.
The January fire is first brought to the highest level, allowing the water to boil, then the furnace fire is brought to a lower level, producing a fixed temperature.
Vegetables and nutrients cooked for about 10 to 15 minutes in steam are controlled by forks after they are well cooked.
The cooked vegetables are taken from the stove and served by placing them on plates.
In steam cooking technique, the appearance, color, and smell of food do not change, so this method is healthy.
The food tastes the same.
So that the quality and flavor of the food remain intact.
In steam cooking, which is also one of the most economic cooking methods, food loss is kept at least.
Vegetables cooked in steam also offer a satisfying feast to those who eat with their more vivid and vibrant appearance.
This method, especially used in diet food, is often preferred because it is light.
David Bowie - Blackstar: Alien's "last" album
Knowing you're going to die, making that last album without telling anyone about it, making the death bed an artistic expression in the video you shot.
Things like this may seem too "fly" for us earthling mortals.
I call them Earth mortals because I am among those who truly believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He came from another corner of the universe to our Earth, and now he's back home; that's what happened.
He came because there was an inspiration to be given not only to Kiss, Marilyn Manson, or Lady Gaga, but to all the artists of the world.
He's done his job.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: $9.99 5/5
He probably fed off Warhol, Kubrick, from the same planet as him.
When Apollo 11, landed on the Moon, he decided to say, "Is that something? I'm an alien." And he came between us singing "Space Oddity."
He didn't get involved; he always went a few steps ahead.
Many have found their lost ways because of him.
The musician and the listener...
And it's not fair to say "It was just music" for his music, aside from his interest in plastic arts and acting and all that.
The characters that wander from song to song and create them in person; their references, innovation, tabudeviity, and discography mean an artistic integrity to me.
I can't remember him as the ancestor of glam rock or punk's cousin...
If I do, what about those avant-garde electronic movements, the jazz he's been hiding in as love since he was a kid?
David Bowie kept reminding us what the word means until those years when we gumd "icon" into our mouths.
It wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman, it wasn't a man.
It was a body.
He appeared to us for a while because of a mission.
That body left this world two days after the 26th studio album "Blackstar" was released.
Before the album was released, he tried to train us to go with "Blackstar" and "Lazarus."
We were thinking, "He's old, he's talking about death or something." He knew everything.
One more game...
Apart from the great "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", which shouldered the album's message and emotion burden, but re-recorded for this album, "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)", together with "'Tis A Pity She Was A Whore", we could say that the number of songs we knew was four.
What's left of it is that "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are also very good songs.
It's all based on a very powerful musical structure, but it's like it's made with such heartfelt, instant feelings, "Blackstar"...
Neither death nor a "revelation with the past" album...
It's just a real "end" album.
"The End" of a life of music that is a masterpiece from beginning to end.
Turkey targeted in Sultanahmet attack
Germany's Federal Police Department President Holger Münch made statements Tuesday about the attack in Sultanahmet Square that killed 10 German citizens in a programme he participated in on German first channel ARD.
Münch said Turkey is the target of the attack, not German citizens.
"400 PEOPLE IN MY EYE"
However, Münch stated that the Sultanahmet attack did not change the danger of terrorism in Germany, saying, "We are still under a threat that must be taken seriously."
Münch said there was a decrease in the number of people who went to Syria to join ISIS from Germany, while several people returned from the war zones.
"There are almost 400 dangerous people we shouldn't be keeping in custody right now," Münch said, expressing that this is a major challenge for security units.
Münch demanded that the co-ordination between police agencies in Europe be improved and a closer communication.
Turkish officials stated that the live bomb that staged the Sultanahmet attack was a Syrian citizen and a member of ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere had stated that the attacker had yet to be identified.
Sezen Aksu says goodbye to the scenes
Sezen Aksu, who decorated his 40th year with a concert series, fascinated his loved ones with his "Sezen Years" concert at the Volkswagen Arena last night.
The final ring of the concert series, held in July, also took place on January 15–16 at the Volkswagen Arena.
Aksu took all his listeners on a 40-year journey from yesterday to today at the concert.
In addition to the love songs that touched our personal lives, Aksu performed his songs on social issues that were deeply concerned about our country and our world.
After performing the concerts he promised, Aksu said he would say goodbye to his stage life, upsetting his fans.
At the "Set Years" concert, Sezen Aksu appeared with a separate story on each track, in front of his loved ones who filled the Volkswagen Arena.
Each story, performance, light and stage show took the audience to a different stage.
The final episode of the memorable concert also featured a video showing featuring the Istanbul paintings of Revolution Erbil.
Aksu also guested them on his stage, appearing on his stage for the first time on videos recorded by his fans in advance.
In Ankara, Istanbul, bread comes a 25-penny raise
In Ankara, as of yesterday, 250 grams of bread was raised by 25 cents and sold at $1.
Earlier in the New Year's, especially in December, after rumors of "a raise to the bread", Minister of Food, Agriculture and Livestock Faruk Çelik and Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci made statements in the form of "No zam".
However, in the capital Ankara, 250 grams of bread was sold yesterday for $1.
Halil Ibrahim Balcı, President of the Turkish Federation of Bakers regarding the 25-cent increase to the bread, said, "There has been no threat, the tariff decision from two years ago has begun to be implemented" and added:
"This was a tariff decision taken two years ago."
The Craft Rooms Association set this schedule two years ago.
It's a price imposed across Turkey.
So there's been a new raise, and there's no price hike.
But due to competition, tradesmen in some areas in Ankara were selling for 75 cents.
In some areas, it was already sold for $1.
The shopkeeper who trusted his counter, his bread, did not lower the price. They now have to apply $1 because of competition.
There's no increase or increase.
They're implementing the unapproved price.
"In the first half of 2016, the kilogram price of the bread will certainly not exceed $5, and if we don't have a lot of trouble, we will complete the year at this price".
In some parts of Istanbul, bread began to be sold for $1.25.
This time, terror has infected Burkina Faso with blood.
23 people from 18 different countries were killed in the attack targeting a luxury hotel known to have been preferred by foreigners and United Nations officials in the West African country of Burkina Faso.
Al Qaeda's North African branch claimed responsibility for the attack.
The attack in Burkina Faso took place four days after ISIS staged a terrorist act in Jakarta, Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country in the world, with 250 million inhabitants.
In a bombing and armed attack on the Starbucks branch and police point on a busy street with foreign embassies, luxury hotels and stores; a Canadian and an Indonesian lost their lives.
Indonesian officials have announced that the attackers were inspired by the Paris massacre on November 13.
Frank Garner, a security reporter for British BBC television, pointed out that this action has been part of a frightening trend that has recently shown itself in many cities around the world.
The U.S. was hurt recently, as well.
At the beginning of last December, 14 people were killed in an armed attack by an ISIS sympathizer couple in San Bernardino, California, United States.
'San Bernardino' attack that shook the United States
Following a live bomb attack in Sultanahmet that killed 10 German tourists, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere also reminded that there were terrorist attacks in many parts of the world, saying, "We've had two major attacks in Paris."
If we say that, then terror wins...
We used the phrase "without backing down."
ISIS quits Whatsapp talking to Alrawi app
According to a new report, the terrorist organisation is taking advantage of its own means of conversation to communicate independently of chat practices such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to Defense One's report, the organisation is taking advantage of the practice of a new messaging to communicate between itself.
This Android app, "Alrawi", is distributed and loaded through an APK file.
The app allows the organization to communicate and share an encrypted message among itself and media.
Flash move from ISIS in Iraq
The functionality of the practice remains "first" in the face of popular applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram, according to Ghost Security Group.
How powerful the encryption used is currently unknown.
ISIS had previously been performing its entire communication via Telegram application, which allowed sending messages via encrypted link.
Telegram, however, had uncovered channels spoken by ISIS members.
Furthermore, the U.S. administration demands application developers to place backdoors in their applications.
So the organization has now begun using their own solutions rather than relying on the encryption of WhatsApp and Telegram.

How should the semester be considered?
We asked Murat Aydın, the education specialist-student coach, how should students evaluate the semester vacation?
The semester vacation should not be considered only for students; recreation, entertainment, spending time on television and computer.
The semester vacation is a crucial opportunity to prepare for the new era of education and to review the past period.
The semester vacation, called leisure, is also an important opportunity to develop personality, knowledge, skill, and hobby.
Make a semi-year evaluation list.
Write down everything you plan to do, and try to implement it.
I assure you, you will enjoy this and have a very productive semester.
Now let's talk about what an efficient semester should be like for fellow students preparing for YGS-LYS.
Because the most questions that come to us from friends preparing for the YGS-LYS exams are, "How should we evaluate this period, do we have to solve a lot of questions, or do we have to deal with them?"
To respond to these and to enjoy a productive period, let us first enter our writing with recommendations to fellow students who are preparing for the test.
While the preparation process is supposed to be a process that starts from the ninth grade under normal circumstances, we're more likely to complete it within the last year, which makes it more effective, more efficient, and more necessary for us to spend the last year using time properly.
In addition to preparing for the exam, seniors must also conduct their school written work together.
The graduate student who completed the school is critical to him at least one time (YGS-LYS), though he has been tested and experienced, the year he will be re-arranged as a graduate student.
Because most graduate students and their family view the year 'O' as their last chance, which creates greater stress.
Studying is the work that the student does because he does not enjoy, he only feels compelled, and so he usually leaves last, but for students who make it regular, who make it habitual, this has become a complete task, and what will be done is always within a plan.
Now we have a semester vacation ahead of us, and we need to make the most of it.
And for that, we must have a plan that will help us manage time well.
Studying on a Half-Year Holiday:
Everyone has to plan their own way first.
What has been taken care of, what has been lacking; it must plan the day, the week, and the 15 days.
During this period, there must be both recurrences and question solutions.
At the same time, students who do not lack much can do an average test or two.
Handle Your Missing Subjects: Studies show that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetting is to do it again.
Students who have made too many mistakes, especially from past issues, should weigh heavily on their overall rework.
Identify your missing issues first and schedule them day by day, place them daily, and make sure you get them done.
This planning will comfort you both academically and psychologically.
Note that when you place matters in your plan, you make the most mistakes.
Because later on, you won't have such a long-term vacation.
Do Question Solutions:
It's as important to solve questions as it is to repeat them.
Because we can only see how much we understand the work we've done through the question we've solved.
Don't forget to put a certain number of solutions on each day.
The number of questions you're going to solve depends on the work you're going to do that day; the subject may not be able to solve a lot of questions on a day when you're doing a lot of hard work, but we should at least do a certain amount of question-solving to see how much we know about that day.
Solve Tests:
Another study you're going to do on your half-year vacation should be to solve test exams.
Although not all subjects are finished, you can at least do course test solutions.
Let's say you've done a lot of Turkish class; you can do 40-question Turkish course essays.
And when you do, do time work.
40 If you can solve the Turkish question in 60 minutes at first, then your next goal is to be able to solve it in a few minutes, if possible.
Holiday and Hobby Plan:
Holidays, of course, are not just about studying; you should spend a few days on vacation, rest, and hobbies.
A holiday period that will only be spent studying will prevent you from being discharged and resting.
Therefore, there must be special times in your plans for yourself.
Reading books, watching TV, surfing the Internet can be part of your plans, most importantly, how much time you're gonna spend.
And I have a little advice for friends who say they didn't get through the first semester.
If my first semester hasn't been very good, I haven't been able to work hard, and if you're saying I'm short, then this semester's vacation is a big opportunity for you.
But first, you have to decide and believe.
In the Turkish football super league, goals were scored between the 76th and 90th most during the 2009–2010 season.
Now you answer your own question, the game is over, and you go to the locker room, or the game's still going on, and you have a lot of minutes to score?
I guess no one wants to say, "We're going to look at the next game", a defeated football team coach or a classic comment used by their players.
Now all you have to do is let go of the past and look ahead, not walk, but run.
Let's wrap this up.
1) Plan a semester vacation first,
2) Go over what you know and do it again,
3) Take care of your loose ends,
4) Do topical reinforcements by solving questions,
5) Solve test exams,
6) Read a book,
7) Set new goals for the new term,
8) Make time for yourself, for your hobbies, and for what you enjoy,
9) Make time for your family and friends,
10) Take time to social and cultural activities (in cinema, sports, theatre, concert, travel, picnic, etc.)
'Kervan' has gone on a long journey
The founder of Kervan's largest 'home' store chain, with 45 stores of an average of 1,000 square feet each, Shinasi Demirel and his son Hasan, have incorporated Home Sweet Home with 17 stores abroad and 25 stores in the dorm, into the caravan.
With the operation recently completed trading registries, the caravan also owned 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
"Now we will continue the major storery with the caravan, the smaller store shopping with the Home Sweet Home," Shinasi Demirel said, stating that there are still no caravan stores abroad.
"The caravan will also be opened abroad," he said.
With the merger of the 2015 turnover, the Home Sweet Home, which was $90 million, a retail chain with a turnover of $140 million and production.
The total sales area size of the caravan, with 45 camels in 35 provinces, is 45,000 square feet.
25 of the stores belong to the main company.
The caravan has employment for about 500 people.
Home Sweet Home has 17 stores abroad, with a total sales area of 6,500 square feet and 320 employees.
Kadir Kalaycioglu, chairman of the Home Sweet Home Board, who is producing, exporting and store with his partner Flame Pakten, stated that they were very pleased with the merger with the caravan, saying, "We are from Mardin and we entered this sector in 1998."
From the beginning, we'd come up with a brand with the support of the Shinasi Gentlemen.
Mr. Shinasi is the 'TRT' of this sector.
We've learned a lot from him.
We even started out as shopkeepers when he gave us the White Central.
We were already working with the caravan as strategic partners, not as rivals.
"Now with this merger, a very serious synergy will emerge," he said.
Kalaycioglu announced that there are 17 stores abroad, currently the weight of Home Sweet Home in the Middle East, and that they also began exporting to China last month.
"We also opened our first corner in Shanghai."
We agreed on a 200-store chain.
"From now on, we will also develop small storery as a caravan abroad, with Home Sweet Home," he said.
Poroshenko sells his factory in Russia
Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, who interviewed Liga.net news website on the issue, said the factory was put up for sale for $200 million.
"Yes, we've put the factory up for sale."
"As soon as we put it out for sale, all the real buyers suddenly disappeared," he said, stating that there was no buyer.
Regarding the price of the firm's factory in Lipetsk, Russia, Moskalevsky said, "We've set it at about $200 million."
Roshen, who produces 450 thousand tons of chocolate and candy a year, is one of the largest producers in the world and is owned by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.
Star Holdings became Pladis abroad
Star Holdings merged global companies operating in the biscuit and chocolate sectors it purchased under the name "Pladis".
A new $5.2 billion food giant was born, with a merger that brought together De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and Countries.
Speaking at a meeting on the merger of global companies within Star Holdings, Star Holding Board Chairman Murat Örr said, "Being a global corporation has been our goal from the very beginning" and added:
Murat Countryr released the $335 million sale live from Periscope
This company, founded 72 years ago, is now moving forward to become a global, global company in the world, in the business of biscuit chocolate confectionery under the name Star Holdings.
During this time, we developed from retail to ambalaja real estate, personal care, and various industrial branches alongside biscuit chocolate confectionery.
77 factories operating in 14 countries, we're at thousands of sales points with 300 brands.
"Now as we look at the possibilities in our family, we want to go back and focus on cookie chocolate confectionery, which is our main business, and be global in this field; for that we are reorganizing," he said.
Mr. Sabri's father is a life story
We're reassessing our corporate structure, reorganizing.
We've divided the world into regions.
And we shared these areas with our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tütçü, Turkey is responsible for the Middle East, K.Africa and Turki Republics.
Mohamed Elsarky is responsible for our global Godiva business, as well as the continent of America and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be in charge of England, Continental Europe and Africa.
The quality and innovation guru, Ali Countryr, will take global responsibility in his field, while Cem Karakash will assist me in managing the business.
China, Russia, in part, South East Asia will be areas that we will build and develop.
Murat Korker sold shares in SAF GYO
"We promise happiness to the whole world with every bite," said Murat Countryr, "Our global firm we set up to make it happen is called Pladis."
"Where did you say you invented the pladis, that name doesn't really mean anything special," he said and added:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
The Japanese are in Subaru, Iran, Pervin.
In Arabic, we were inspired by the name Pleiades constellation of seven stars in Latin, meaning "Süreyya", which means "Elander."
So we translated the country into global.
Vice President of the Star Holding Board, Ali Överr, stressed and added that they "began to create synergy in innovation" by collaborating with laboratories in different countries:
We have very valuable AR-GE teams, and we've assembled these teams, and we've had certain synergies in working on an AR-GE platform so far.
We have 27 R-GE centers under Pladis.
The largest of these are in Turkey and England.
We have over 300 AR-GE experts working here.
And the synergy work has already begun to yield results.
The drama of Digestives (Nibbles), which was produced in the Countryr and will begin exporting to the UK, is produced in Silivri in the Countryr's chocolate factory.
Another example of synergy: brands are different, but products are the same, Countryr Krispi serrated.
By adapting a pretzel technology developed in the UK, the Jacob's Crinklys product, to Turkey, we soon earned a good taste under the name Countryr Krispi Scratcher.
Laviva, whom we all know very well, met with consumers in America today.
The Call of Duty series has exceeded 250 million limits
This series of Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games carved its name in gold letters into the game world seems to have been memorable for many years.
In particular, the newly announced sales numbers are pretty much proof of how legendary we need to find them.
Holding the license rights to the series, Activision showed 250 million copies in the number of sales it shared privately at the end of the year.
At the beginning of last year, the company has been able to sell 75 million Call of Duty games since then.
And most of that number, no doubt, is a game of Black Ops 3, so we wouldn't be wrong.
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was elected President once again
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu has been re-elected as chairman of the Convention.
Kılıçdaroğlu, who received 990 votes from 1,000 238 delegates who voted, became the president who came back.
Of the votes used, 248 were ruled invalid.
Following the announcement of the result, the party showed joy.
The CHP had a total of 1,275 delegates.
The convention completed its work to meet on Sunday at 10 p.m.
Kılıçdaroğlu said in summary at the convention:
We wanted games to be played here, we wanted songs to be sung.
But it's not good where we're coming from.
There is an unmanageable fact of Turkey.
The atmosphere is clouding all of this.
The reason for the pessimistic painting is because of the people who rule the country.
As CHP, we oppose terrorism no matter where it comes from.
Terror is a crime of humanity, and terrorists should never be forgiven.
The fight against terrorism is done by reason, by knowledge, by wisdom.
Of course we have to fight, we want to make sure no one gets a nosebleed.
What's the difference between photographs in Syria and Lebanon, photos in the Southeast?
When they sat at the table, they made some serious mistakes.
Power is responsible for all the blood flowing, the tears, the deaths.
In 2002, they surrendered the country with zero terrors, today there is a Turkey that has turned into a bloodbath.
Who is responsible for all this?
The taxi driver in Diyarbakir is Şehmuz?
What's Turkey paying for?
We're going to attend meetings, we're going to convey our thoughts about changing the laws of impact.
We will not allow a country to be built on anyone's personal views.
I say, "Come on, let's change the impacting spirit."
The intellectuals of this country are being raided and taken into custody at the crack of dawn.
There are ways we don't agree, but people should be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictator says, "He who eats the bread of the state and is hostile to the state."
And I'd like to ask him, why didn't they think when they were robbing the government who ate the bread of the state and took advantage of all the resources of the state?
The CHP is the party that brings the biggest changes to this country.
We will prepare together for the fourth great revolution.
Whatever the cost, we will bring liberal democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can take us into custody, no matter what they do, no matter how much it costs, the CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I'm calling you loud and clear, Davutoglu.
Hiding behind coup law, the man hiding has not cast the mindset of impact out of his head.
You gave the man who gave you a special service medal.
What blow are you talking about?
He's all about tricking the public.
Party officials listed the other 3 revolutions as: The 1st great revolution was ended and the establishment of the Republic; the 2nd great revolution was the time of the Inönu to go from one-party period to the more party period; the 3rd revolution was the transition to social democracy with Bulent Ecevit...
The president has qualities, duties.
Article 103 has the president's oath.
We know how important the concept of honor and honor is in this society.
If a person makes that promise, he will fulfill it to his death.
Because honor and honor are not discussed for us.
The man who's a dictator, what does honor and honor mean to you?
What do you understand about honor and honor, and why did you take this oath?
What does honor and honor mean to you?
That's what I want to know.
In the religious man, the concept of honor and honor is the crown.
Their intention is not to abolish the law of coup d'état, but to arbitrate the law of coup d'état.
Not enough. They want the presidential system.
How to be president; the bossy presidential system.
Why are you rejecting the parliamentary system of the Ottomans?
Anyone who commands will do what is necessary.
Does the parliamentary work well in Turkey?
No, it doesn't.
If we bring in Libertarian democracy, the system works.
They call it a coup d'état, but they've strengthened the law of coup d'état.
Izmir MP Mustafa Balbay, who announced his candidacy for the general presidency, failed to participate in the race because he failed to collect the signatures of 128 delegates needed for the nomination.
Balbay, who was able to collect 92 signatures, said, "I can't run on current terms."
In the convention hall, it was noted that while there were places reserved for MPs party council (PM), central executive board (MYK) and honor board members, former CHP Leader Deniz Baykal sat in the stands with the party members.
Stanbul MP Gülay Reservoir has come early to sit next to President Kılıçdaroğlu instead of sitting where is reserved for MPs.
Yalova MP Muharrem İnce’s meeting with Kılıçdaroğlu has also been one of the topics spoken in the convention hall.
İnce explained that he had been offered a membership in PM, and he himself refused to accept it.
However, central sources have claimed that the request for a meeting came from İnce and that no membership in PM has been proposed.
İnce posted on Twitter the message, "Nobody can learn about these headquarters sources, the content of the meeting from İstanbul MP Ali Özcan".
And Ozcan was like, "How could I know about two people meeting?"
He just said, "He's gone."
Kılıçdaroğlu often applauded the ba- press.
On the first day of the usual "Democracy, Change and Fellowship Board", party council (PM) lobbies were marked.
Kılıçdaroğlu went home to work for the PM list after the convention speech.
It has been learned that while making Kılıçdaroğlu's key list of 100 people, current members of MYK have announced that they do not want to be in charge, they will be on the list by telephone calling 13 MYK members other than Şeyhan Erdoğdu who once again ran for PM.
Kılıçdaroğlu is said to point to the 100-man PM key list, as well as another narrowed-down list.
The 21-point result declaration, which was unanimously adopted in the CHP Council, demanded the removal of sherkhs on the European Local Government Condition raised by the DTK's debates on autonomy, increased power sharing in the locality.
The declaration also included the goals of "the end of the party state order", "the establishment of a law state that can be transparent and accountable".
İdris Baluken of HDP, Russar Demirel of MHP followed.
AK Party’s Özdağ and EC Party delegation left the hall after Kılıçdaroğlu harshly criticized President Erdoğan.
"I saw that he was missing the dose of criticism, I couldn't accept it," Ozdağ said.
"How can darkness come into light if I don't burn if you don't burn if I don't burn up" and the banner with photos of arrested journalists Can Dündar and Erdem Gül in the hall noted the banner "Peace" in Kurdish, Turkish and English.
The convention began in the morning with the songs Group Commentary and Ahmet Kaya.
Diyarbakır Bar President Tahir Elçi’s wife Türkan Elçi who lost her life in the shooting received much applause.
Berkin Elvan's mother Gülsum and her father Sami Elvan also joined the convention.
Kılıçdaroğlu said they would claim democracy "death" regardless of what price it takes to pay was the most applauding part of the speech.
So far, the CHP has convened 52 conventions -- 34 regular and 18 extraordinary -- at Ankara Arena yesterday.
The turnout was high.
There were more than 15,000 CHPs in the 12,000-seat hall.
However, there was no enthusiasm that the crowd deserved.
The most exciting moment was when Kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu.
The excitement continued as Kılıçdaroğlu greeted the hall.
There was no discipline at the AK Party conventions in the hall.
Even as Kılıçdaroğlu spoke, there was great activity in the area on the field of the Arena.
Clearly, CHPs who wanted to enter the Party Assembly preferred to seek support by describing themselves to party executives and journalists.
A CHP executive tried to explain that this situation is not a bad thing, with the words, "It's better than having extra party members lined up like ropes and sit still like party meetings in Korea or the Soviet Union."
The CHP convention differs from the EC Party or MHP conventions.
Only presidents speak at these parties.
At CHP, the convention becomes a platform where party problems are also discussed.
As there were too many party members who wanted to speak at yesterday’s convention, Court President Murat Karayalçin had trouble setting the time.
While there was a phrase in the faces and languages that "The place is going badly", there was also a distance from the comments, "You'll change the course with the painting coming out of this hall."
Although all CHP people said, "He must do something," there was no coherent and strong answer to the question, "What should he do?"
The impact of this was that there would be no election in the next four years.
When Kılıçdaroğlu came to the stand, we also expected journalists to respond to the question “What should he do”.
Kılıçdaroğlu answered the question first.
He noted the situation with arrested journalists, academics due to the declaration, what happened in the Southeast, the deadlock with foreign policy.
He long responded to "Anatolian legends" about his party, such as "religious party" about the CHP, "supporting the battles", "is the party of the elitists".
And when it came to the "what to do" stage, instead of talking about concrete steps, he tried to put "strategy" out there.
He stressed that all these problems can be overcome by more powerful democracy and more justice.
He also made a promise on behalf of the CHP and said, "We will work at any cost until we bring democracy."
"We will fight to the death for democracy," he said.
A final note is to remind you that the CHP, as of the 53rd convention, has taken care of the "organization" issue, is now able to gather conventions without problems.
Meanwhile, cards had been printed for 900 journalists who were said to follow the convention, but journalist participation in the hall was not at that level.
Ankara representatives of media outlets were not as eager to follow the convention as the EC Party conventions.
Self-government has been asked for life
The indictment prepared by Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office on 7 arrested defendants has been passed by 4th Heavy Penal Court.
Following instructions and calls from top executives of the PKK/KCK terrorist organization, the indictment stated that statements were made under the name “government” in some districts and neighborhoods of Diyarbakır, İstanbul, Şırnak, Mardin, Mush, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Ağrı.
The indictment stated that calls for illegal action from the ringleaders and women’s constructions stated that there has been an increase in security forces, public institutions and organizations in Diyarbakır’s Sur, Binlar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro districts, bombing, long-barreled gun and rocket launcher attacks against citizens’ homes, workplaces and vehicles.
Opponents clashed with ISIS Our police station has been shot
The recent clashes between Düden, Kara Mezra Büğddin of Syria opposite the Yavuzlu Village of Kilis and the ISIS and the Conquest Army, formed by opposition groups in the Black Bridge Village, continue to escalate.
The sound of weapons and mortars fired during clashes between ISIS and opponents, which ran near the border, is also heard by Turkey.
Smoke rising from areas where frequent explosions occurred was visible to the naked eye by Turkey, while security forces on the border took heavy measures with armoured vehicles.
On the other hand, harassment shots were fired at the Martyr Mehmet Border Police Station near Yavuzlu Village of Kilis from Büguddın Village under the control of ISIS militants.
As part of the rules of engagement, soldiers responded with obverse and heavy weapons to the area where the harassment fire was opened.
Russian fighter planes allegedly launched an attack on Hameh village, 17km from the Turkish border.
Six Syrians wounded in air bombardment were brought to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by their relatives.
The lotto rich took their checks
The Robinson couple, who lived in a small house worth $150,000 in Munford, Tennessee, chose to receive a single payment of $328 million (about $1 billion) rather than receive a total of $528.8 million (1.6 billion tl) over a 29-year period.
"After all, there is no guarantee for tomorrow," the couple said.
John Robinson, who works on a store chain and his wife Lisa, who works as an assistant alongside a dermatologist, said they would now be in charge of their business on Monday, although they are millionaires.
With the money they earn, the couple aims primarily to pay off the mortgage debt and help relatives.
It was announced that the jackpot was divided into three.
iOS9: how to get a new iPhone operating system, Apple update published
By going to the Settings application for the new operating system, you can touch "Genele" and select "Written Update".
When ready, your phone will give you the option to download and install.
Some users had a problem following this installation and received a error message saying "Written update failed".
To overcome this problem, users are advised to wait for the system to decline or try and upgrade iTunes from there.
The phone will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may also include erasing applications to make room -- but Apple has reduced the upgrade to prevent this from happening, and is using a special tool for re-establishment when the process is over.
It is worth making sure that your phone is charged or that you have a charger with you so that your battery doesn't die while the upgrade is going on.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't allow an update, because the phone can stop halfway through to cut off the upgrade.

FedEx's revenues are mixed, financial outlook will drop in 2016
FedEx has reported disappointing results for the past three months, and the cargo giant has reduced its profit forecast all year due to reduced demand for cargo services and increased costs in ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx had announced that he would receive 50,000 seasons of workers for the holidays.
About 2.5% fell in pre-opening transactions 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening gong.
FedEx Corp. said that between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that will end next May, this is 20 cents less than previous estimates.
Analysts expected $10.84 based on research by FactSet.
There is an average increase of 4.9% that will be valid on January 4th, and the possibility of a decline in heavy or large packages, despite high surcharges that will start in November in land transport.
Cost cuts, says the company, are still expected to be high from higher revenue and the growth of e-commerce than the previous year.
The president and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "performs soundly, especially despite the poor economic conditions expected in manufacturing and global trade."
Holiday employment plans were announced a day after rival firm UPS, according to which UPS said it plans to receive 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, the same number as last year.
During the three-month period ending on 31 August, FedEx raised revenue by 6% from the previous year, earning $692 million.
The gain per share took place at $2.42, behind 12 analysts discussed by Zacks Investment Research's estimates of $2.44.
Revenue went up 5%, $12.3 billion.
Six analysts, interviewed by Zacks, expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx was hit by a decline in international priority shipping last year, which caused revenue to stagnate in the Express unit.
However, the explosion in online shopping raised FedEx Ground Services results.
In the last quarter, ground services revenue increased 29% but business revenue was basically stagnant due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
As revenue fell in the cargo business at high labor costs, the express unit saw high income due to high base rates.
In pre-opening transactions about an hour before the opening gong, FedEx shares dropped to $150.15 with a drop of $3.85 or 2.5%.
They closed Tuesday with a drop of 11% for the year and 17% below the record level on 11 June.
In their most anticipated meeting for years, Federal Reserve politicians have decided this week that it is time to increase interest rate almost a decade by spending two days around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table.
The two-story meeting room on a wing of the central bank will be the United States mural.
The map is a reminder that the Female President of the Fed, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues, hold the nation's economic interests above all else.
The central bank has two tasks from Congress: to maximize US employment and to keep prices here stable.
However, since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is a third non-written power of attorney: financial balance.
And this third power of attorney may be the X factor in a decision too close to be predicted whether the US economy, which will be announced on Thursday, is ready to start to cut unique stimulus support from the near-zero-term interest rate that has been going on since late 2008.
Although most data show that the economy has grown robustly, the recent turbulent in global financial markets can already make careful Fed officers timid about adding vulnerability by increasing reference federal funding interest -- even at a fraction of a percent.
"Openly, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piezza, chief economist of the broker firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they are looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the growing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them sufficient justification to wait a little longer," he said.
There's no consensus on what the Fed will do, and it's causing fluctuations in the financial markets in itself.
Half the economists Bloomberg had recently interviewed were expecting an increase in interest this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to stand by along with the main indicator, which shows only the possibility of an increase of about 30%.
This may indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, if policymakers do not ease its impact by promising another increase could be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industry index average rose to 16,599.85 with 228.89 points or 1.4% increase.
Moody's Capital Markets Research Group chief economist John Lonski said, "The ratio of the Fed policy makers of Iraq has been triggered in anticipation that they will keep it steady this week."
"It would be surprising that Fed is now increasing rates," he said.
If the Fed executives had decided in this direction, they would have "had to take a long year to calm the financial markets so they wouldn't panic."
Other experts suggested that an increase in proportion could calm financial markets due to the lifting of the fog curtain on when the Fed would take action.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be on the way to increasing the rate by 0.25 percent this month; that would be a small step towards slowly contracting monetary conditions, strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Despite complaints by liberals about the need for a more economic process, Yellen said he expects this year's increase in rate during spring and early summer.
Despite the rate of job creation declining in August, growth in the labour market was stable this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%, the lowest level in seven years last month, and approached the level where the Fed counted full employment.
Salary increases showed signs of improvement.
And although inflation continues to monitor below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed politicians said that the temporary impact of sharply reduced oil prices is an important reason.
Pantheon Macroeconomist chief economist Ian Shepherdson said the economy "can handle higher rates and needs it despite the shortage in the labor market".
However, financial markets all over the world began to shake after China finally went into devaluation in the currency last month.
The Dow Jones industrial index average dropped to about 16% below the record level in May, as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would bring global growth down.
When the market was now almost 10% below Dow's high level in May, it somehow jumped back.
The market shake-up for Fed policy makers further complicates the calculation of the time when interest rate will be increased.
Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research partner and previous Fed official at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, said, "They may have been a little narrow at this meeting, with the lack of news about the lack of news about financial markets in the Chinese economy over the past few weeks."
He now estimates that they will wait at least another month to manage these effects better.
"There is much uncertainty as to what the impacts in the US economy will be, and they have virtually no data to rely on the update of developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's primary concerns, so there should be no factor in the process of technically landing.
In reality, however, Fed became the world's monetary official.
The impact of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
Until then, the only clue from President Ben S. Bernanke was that in 2013 the Fed could "reduce" the monetary expansion triggered by market tremors worldwide.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials may not only be expected to follow developments elsewhere but also consult other central bank managers and experts to better read the global economy.
Zachary Karabell, global strategist of the asset management firm Envestnet Inc., said the decision-making process was "a talent rather than science".
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va. President Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that "Fed has overreacted in the past to financial market movements that do not appear to be linked to economic foundations."
Lacker, a member of the policy-maker Federal Open Market Committee with voting rights and pressured for a rate increase, referred to 1998–99 decisions as examples.
"Despite limited identifiable advice for U.S. growth", Lacker said, the financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to cut 0.75% of the gauge rate during three meetings.
A year later, Fed officials recovered these cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a previous member of the UK Central Bank rate-setting committee, said, "Fed should only put financial balance concerns first during major crises, as in the 2008 market meltdown."
He said the last tremor wasn't getting anywhere near this level.
The president of the Peterson International Institute of Economics, Posen, said you really don't want to have to be afraid to go to a rate hike because the markets are broken.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers and does not speak of financial balance, and I do not think they should take action in that direction until that changes.

Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Society promotes healthy nutrition during breast feeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS resorted to a shocking method, featuring pictures of milk children illustrated with ill-nutrition depictions to try and explain the importance of healthy nutrition to women in the process of trying and nursing.
Human milk consists of many types of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbs, which provide babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a healthy immune system.
Due to energy surplus requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake to around 500 calories.
However, new research shows that food supplements for mothers are not limited to calorie intake.
According to a new study led by Robert Waterland, Professor of Texas Baylor Medical College, the healthy diets of pregnant women affected the genetic expression of their babies, protecting them against tumor development.
Unfortunately, malnutrition has been determined to adversely affect the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise continues to excel in ratings despite Nine's efforts to take the lead on the Today Show
The moves Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson made to Canberra in an attempt to overthrow Liberal leadership failed to achieve a ratings boost for Today.
After Tony Abbott's fall of Malcolm Turnbull, Nine's breakfast show was performed in the national capital.
Rival Sunrise, hosted in London by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was trapped between weekly international shows including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance problem does not seem to make much difference to Australian audiences, with Sunrise in five capitals in response to Today's 339,000 figures, with an average of 397,000 viewers.
Today (317,000) recorded a slight increase in ratings compared to last Tuesday (283,000), but the figure was still behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today's been catching up with Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Sunrise's Today average was 318,000 in response to 330,000 figures.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
By September today, the Sunrise average is 349,000 for Today's 314,000 figures.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect the people of this morning rather than parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the breathtaking beginning of 800 words from Erik Thomson, star of the former Packed to the Rafters.
The new drama about a newly widowed father deciding to move to the seaside in New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive average of 1,219 million.
Critics questioned whether Thomson could run a solo show without Rebecca Gibney, Rafters' star.
Last night's result was a ringing yes.
Seven's X Factor retained its power with 1,136 million viewers, easily beating Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven Two Followers... confused their night fortunes with Australia.
The first half hour (17:00–17:30) of the new information competition hosted by Andrew O'Keefe reached an average of 446,000 viewers.
In the second half hour (17:30–18:00), the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday Night Follow-Australia's first half hour averaged 520,000 viewers, while the number rose to 720,000 in the second half hour.
The Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Following Australia's ratings drop on the second night led Nine to think that at 5:30 the Hot Seat would gain the upper hand.
Following Australia was an amendment to McGuire's show that was replaced by the Million Dollar Minute that had no teeth.

The three last people who think single Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who's he gonna pick?
Did the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who will win the Bachelor.
At the end of Sam Wood's Bachelor show, the woman he was going to choose was left in great secrecy.
And the other three girls are doing their best not to tell us who bought the last rose.
However, if we check Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski the day before the three fell in two; they may have given a clue as to who the winner would be without realizing it.
Sam Wood sealed his mouth until Thursday's final.
All three women described in lyrical language why Wood was perfect; by emphasizing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude, they said why they wanted to be his partners.
But their answer to the question, "If not you, who should take Wood's last rose?" may contain information about who will win The Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best candidate for Wood except themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been close since day one.
Jeavons-Fellows said: "From the moment I got home, I felt they fit together by reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy, and I thought so throughout the program."
Markoski added, "Sarah is so practical, it's so much fun to be around her."
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel so good and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
Mackay said last week's house visit appointments made him think he was Wood's "right person."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that it was definitely not just a game - I'm totally attached to him now."
When asked who Wood could choose without him, he was mysterious.
He said, "I don't know if I can say this."
"I love other girls equally - Snezana and Lana equal."
The Bachelor airs Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.
First broadcast: Sarah's the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had various options in terms of where he would start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle paid a lot of attention to him after he himself moved to the United States, and after last year's impressive open practice day, many other teams approached him.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and that seems like a very wise decision.
Some coaches would seat Hayne on the bench due to his loss in his performance in the Australian rugby league, as in a 20–3 victory over Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula believed in this man and gave Hayne another chance to appear in a play following Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula continued to show her true color to the dressing room after the game.
Instead of humiliating the rookies in front of the whole team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also openly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
Cam Inman, a reporter for the 49ers team, said Hayne also took courage from special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey and was advised to forget about this drop and consider the next game.
Jarryd Hayne caused the Minnesoa Vikings to score in the first quarter and dropped the ball.
This was not what Hayne and his large Australian fan base had imagined for their first match in the NFL.
Hayne was seen swearing out of the field after dropping the ball, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy that he could not think of a worse start for his NFL career at 2DayFM 104.1.
Hayne said, "That was just one of those things, you get upset about the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also reminded Queensland of his 2007 Origin first game, with a back pass scoring.
Nevertheless, this was a great experience for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne released the pose on Instagram while holding an Australian flag with fans after the game.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003 Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, had been arrested at gunpoint in a passageway in Siberia.
Khodorkovsky, who openly opposed President Vladimir Putin, was jailed, the oil company Yukos was seized, and his pro-democracy efforts were cut short.
In Nepal, the result of the police shooting plastic bullets at protestors was 4 killed.
Four people were killed, including a 4-year-old boy, as police fired plastic bullets at the crowd demonstrating against the new constitution offered in the country on Wednesday, an official reported.
The incident occurred Tuesday evening in the city of Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital city of Katmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district chief official, said that from 1000 to 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station and some threw stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used pepper spray and opened fire on the air before using plastic bullets.
He said twenty policemen and five civilians were injured.
It's not clear why plastic bullets, known to have killed but often used as a less deadly alternative, resulted in such a high mortality case.
The conflict was the last of the violent protests that have been going on for weeks across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group suggest that areas created by the proposed new constitution would dilute their political influence.
The ethnic Tharus group, which wants to form their own state, is also protesting in western Nepal.
At least 40 people have died, 11 of whom were police officers, in violent fighting since 10 August.
At this date, four major political parties had agreed to divide the country into regions -- also an important but creative step for drafting a new constitution in Nepal, which has been governed by the central state for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake in April that killed thousands of people.
Legislators worked on draft constitutional provisions in Katmandu this week, and officials said the new text will be held by Sunday.
NHC says there's a 60% chance of hurricanes south of the Cape Verde Islands.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday that a wide low pressure system 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 per cent likely to turn into a tropical hurricane within the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low pressure system was also seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecasting centre said there was a 60% chance of tropical hurricane forming over the next two days.
Google launches fundraising campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced a fundraising campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organisations that have helped thousands of refugees travel to Europe by fleeing their countries that have been damaged and impoverished from the war.
Google has declared a donation attempt on its blog, with an unexpected personal approach to it.
Instead of making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote her own personal experience.
"Our journey included hunger, thirst, cold and fear, as well as numerous dark buses and train journeys," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But because the refugee and immigrant crisis in Europe has grown, many families, like my family, need help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organizations offering aid to refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Rescue of Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match the first $5.5 million donation to Google.com/refugeerelief until it raises $11 million.
Europe faces the worst refugee crisis since World War II, the biggest cause of which is the four-year Syrian civil war, which displaced more than 4 million people this year.
He is also fleeing Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which have been damaged by many wars.

A weight loss surgery can help moderately obese diabetics.
According to a new study, it may take at least five years to benefit from obesity surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes.
But it's too early to tell if moderately obese diabetes patients have lived longer than patients who haven't had surgery following obesity surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote an article in the new study on JAMA surgery, who specializes in obesity surgery, "it takes a long time for mortality rates to manifest themselves."
Weight loss surgeries, also known as bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce stomach diameter.
These reduce hunger and restrict the body’s ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery was proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research was done on advanced obese people with body mass index (VKI) 35 or over.
BMI, which measures the weight by height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
The BMI shows that 25 or more people are overweight, while those with over 30 BMIs are considered obese.
BMI can calculate from this link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new research, Taiwan's full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital has used data from their experiment since 2007 on two types of bariatric surgery -- gastric bypasses and tube stomach surgeries -- which have been practiced in the treatment of type 2 diabetes-mediated obese patients.
Beginning in the late fifth year of the research, the average BMI 31 to 24.5 were reduced from 31 to 24.5.
In response to this, BMIs of those undergoing non-surgical diabetes treatment have remained stable around 29.
Diabetes has been partially solved in 36% of those who have been operated on and 28% entirely.
In a medically treated group, diabetes has been fully resolved in just 1% and only in 2%.
The authors also noted that blood pressure control, triglycerids, and "bad" LDL cholesterol, were generally better in the "surgical group".
Researchers have also screened blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, which reflect the blood sugar rate in patients over time.
Researchers say it's best to keep the A1c hemoglobin below 7%.
Post-op A1c hemoglobin has decreased from an average of 9 percent to about 6 percent.
The group receiving medical treatment has remained stable for around 8%.
However, with improved levels of A1c hemoglobin, this better "glycemic control" did not lower the mortality rate over these five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his teammates who conducted the research.
The research team compared the findings to these two types of surgeries.
In the fifth year, the group with bypass surgery compared to the group with tube stomach surgery lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (7.4 to 5.1 kg), and similarly A1c hemoglobin (3.1% to 2.1%), and their diabetes was more likely to decline altogether (46.9 to 16.7%).
Although the research did not indicate a clear benefit of post-op survival at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone of Arizona Medical College-Phoenix said that surgery had valid data that the lifespan was extended according to a study conducted in more overweight patients in Sweden.
Swedish in this study, obese patients who had undergone bariatric surgery were 29 percent less likely to die in 15 years than any other group that had been treated more conventionally.
Although this new study has not shown what the benefits of the survival of surgical patients are, according to Blackstone, relevant and reassuring for those below BMI 35.
This is the most crucial part of the article, because BMI says that this surgery is safe in the low group, no increase in risk of death or renal ailments has been seen.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should begin to take seriously the issue of weight gain with the patient dropping below 27 to 30 BMI.
I think he said we've waited long enough for people to take this seriously.
I think it's really hard to reverse these genetic changes that make their bodies associated with obesity and diabetes.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama said Europe cannot host all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the countries of refugees.
At the start of his 10-day visit to England, the Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre at Oxford, which will work on ethics.
Under the current circumstances, he claimed that the interests of humanity should be put first, rather than the interests of countries or continents.
At the same time, he stressed that countries in Western Europe's responses to the refugee crisis, although appreciated, are insufficient.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Germany and Austria appreciated efforts to cope with the crisis, the Dalai Lama said they were only with temporary solution.
"It's great to take care of a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions; you have to think about how you can bring lasting peace and lasting development to these Muslim countries, basically through education."
We need to think about how to reduce deaths in our country.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Use of force has never been a solution to problems," he added.
In addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also referred to George Bush's actions following the 9/11 attacks, and said that the U.S.'s violent responses started a chain of uncontrollable events.
In my letter to President Bush after 9/11, I expressed my condolences and expressed that the solution to this problem was through nonviolent methods.
I know his motives are well-intentioned, but he himself used force and caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four times the increase in hand antiseptic ingestion seen in children in the last four years.
Toxic control centers in the United States have reported an increase of almost 400 percent in wet wipe swallows, which contain high levels of alcohol in children under the age of 12 since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of ingestion of hand antiseptic in children under the age of 12 reported to the center increased from 3,266 cases in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Lopez told CNN, "Children have shown more demand for such products, and unfortunately there are those among them who are in the percentage to be rushed to the emergency room."
He said that some children drank on purpose of hand antiseptics, while others did so in an attempt to impress their friends or in a social media claim.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking antiseptic for cheap drunks.
Some adolescents have been reported to have mixed the antiseptic mixture with mouthwaters containing alcohol to obtain a stronger inside.
Little children can get attracted to their antiseptic scents.
Lopez said, "The kid doesn't think it's a bad thing."
Most of those who are more attractive (handy antiseptics) are scented.
There are strawberry, grape, and orange-flavored hand antiseptics that are extremely attractive to children.
El antiseptics contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially with little kids, it can only cause a few puffs of alcohol poisoning.
According to Dr. Stephen Thornton, head of the poisoning center at the University of Kansas Hospital, the city of Kansas has given Fox 4 television, "highly concentrated alcohol."
You don't leave a few whiskey glasses lying around, but people leave these hand-to-hand antiseptics out in the open, and that's an easy way for kids to get a lot of alcohol.
Recently, six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who had only swallowed the strawberry-scented hand antiseptic at his school, was rushed to the emergency room for treatment.
The alcohol level in his blood was 0.179, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an ER doctor who took care of him at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta, which was twice the legal alcohol limit accepted in an adult person.
Nhaijah couldn't pronounce the words and when he came to his emergency room he couldn't walk.
Rithey reported that because alcohol caused the little girl to fall and hit her head, doctors kept her overnight in a separate children's hospital despite any signs of brain trauma.
Anne Ortoria Scott told CNN in a statement that it was "very scary".
It could have been lethal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to keep the contact of antiseptic handkerchiefs with the skin short and to places where children could not reach.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics were found to be associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died of ingestion of hand antiseptic containing an undisclosed toxic substance.
Health officials have suggested that the substance may not have been ethyl alcohol, as indicated on the list of contents, but it may have had a fatal effect, methyl alcohol.
In January, three fourth-year students from northern New York had conspired to "place anti-bacterial products around the classroom", according to police reports, with the intention of poisoning their "bad-hearted" teachers.
The teacher banned it from being used in class because she was extremely allergic to hand-to-hand antiseptic.
Police have called this foiled plan a "empty attempt", offering disciplinary action to the school board.
Come to the Milky Way.
Robin van Persie, who watched Fenerbahçe's THY European League match with Locomotive Kuban, eventually met with Udoh, Vesely and Melih.
Van Persie, who had a warm conversation with his fan, Udoh, said, "I'm here to watch you."
You're gonna watch me practice with your friends.
He said, "I'm waiting for you in the Milky Way."
Bitch is innocent.
What a humanist I am today.
I want there to be no deaths.
By no means!
This world is cruel.
Felekse is a bitch.
Death is also fate.
Pain, too.
And the alien invasion.
Lightning strike, too.
It's a space shuttle that sometimes hits.
Maybe a meteor.
What I'm saying is, no deaths.
I mean, let's sign.
Let's put our reaction into it.
Let's say, bitch, what a disaster!
May our humanism grow.
And let him be ashamed of it.
But he's not ashamed, damn it!
Two weeks ago, they killed Miray Ince in the Sur Neighborhood of Şırnak.
He was only three months old.
His grandfather was with him.
They killed him, too.
What can we say, bitch?
I think he was running from aliens.
They scanned him while he was looking for a safe haven.
He had his wife with him.
The day after that, they killed Angel Alpaddin at the breakfast table in Diyarbakir.
A day or two later, Sema Jingıllıoğlu burned down Elementary School, aliens.
Two days ago, the same aliens attacked another school full of students with firearms.
The students were running away from each other.
On January 10, 3 men's bodies killed by attacks of the bitch in Şehit Harun Boy neighborhood were released at the Prophet Hussain Mosque.
Three children were killed in Çınar district of Diyarbakır two days ago.
An unidentified object killed these little ones with a ton of explosives.
There have been other deaths, and there have been injuries.
Who's to blame?
Felek, of course.
Son of a bitch.
No, it's not disaster that's a bitch.
Bitch is innocent!
The killer's out there, waving his hand and grinning at us.
Others try to divert attention.
While the killer is right in front of us, he's creating opportunities for her to run away instead of pointing to the killer.
He's covering for the killer.
He's hiding it.
And after he disappears, he tells everyone that he didn't actually commit any crime.
The sides of the fight we've had in the last 10 years are very clear.
Someone wants the circle of fire around us to tighten and burn us.
And someone's trying to stop it, and what's more, put out the fire around us.
Someone's trying to tear it down, to loot it.
Someone's after making, producing.
There are those who have given us, our territory, all kinds of war.
Civil war.
It's an intergovernmental war.
The battle of the sects.
The power of attorney.
And they have subcontractors.
Dirty terrorist organizations.
Bloody clowns with their hands.

A crocodile fossil the size of a bus has been found
The prehistoric sea crocodile reportedly found 10 metres long and 3 tons of its weight.
The crocodile was measured only at 6 feet (1.6 m) in length of the skull.
Researchers called the species "Machimosaurus rex", publishing the findings in Cretaceous Research magazine.
Federico Fanti of Bologna University, the editor-in-chief of the article, stated that the fossil, apparently 130 million years old, was "almost the size of a bus".
Speaking to the Washington Post, Fanti said that the giant-sized saltwater crocodile "was found at the top of the food chain at least in a certain area at the time."
Paleontologists explained that M. rex, thought to be the largest crocodile living in the sea, was hunted by ambushing in lagoons.
The largest freshwater crocodile in history is thought to have been the "Sarcosuchus imperator" who lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago and could reach 12 metres in height and weighs 8 tons.
They're all so confused!
Writer Ece Popeyekuran's 1996 first book, 'All Women Are Confused', was adapted into theatre under the same name by Aysa Production Theatre.
Deniz Çakır, Zeynep Kankonde, İpek Turktan Source, Kadir Çermik and Shebnem Sönmez are directing the game.
His plays 'Poz' and 'Kuru Tight' are still going on, the first time Flyer has had text writing and directing experience, the game questions the confusion in women's heads.
The game met with an audience at the Trump Show Center last week.
The play begins with radio theater.
In the dark, a voice that takes us back to the past years...
Then the curtain opens.
A woman standing by the window, about to jump down.
It would explain who he was and why he tried to commit suicide, with his next-door neighbors interfering.
A MECHUM IS LEAVING
'Ebru Uysal', portrayed by Deniz Çakır, is a popular writer.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
It's got stuff in it that's been piling up since you were a kid.
His inability to experience fatherly love, his exclusion in student life, his solitary childhood, his misrelationships, his incomprehensible thought; it brought him to this point.
He decided to commit suicide by leaving behind a letter, but he can't jump out the window.
Because the mystery woman who lives across the street from the next door with her chatty and pure cleaner, 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde), keeps him talking.
They're treating it like a normal, normal process.
She gets more nervous and can't concentrate and jump.
The conversation between the trio is turning into a riot when the famous singer 'Meltem Kaya' (Ipek Turktan Source), who had his house cleaned, joins in.
The 'Meltem', which approaches the situation in its own naive and sincere style, cannot stop singing when it sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt is gaining a different dimension as the real estate agent 'Murat' (Kadir Cermik) enters the girl's house with a spare key.
The singer 'Meltem' lying to the press is making things worse.
The play also uses Nazan Priorl's 'Street Girl'.
THIS IS THE GROUND
First time on a diet, Flyer managed to maintain the pace and flow of the game.
Zeynep Kankonde and Ipek Türktan are pulling the comedy load of the game.
The caricatured types played by the two manage to make the audience laugh with both their gestures and their lines.
Shebnem Sönmez has been very well relaying the experience of the years to the stage, while Deniz Çakır performs convincingly in reflecting the depressed mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir Cermik, who mentions his name for his performance in Tolga Steel's award-winning film 'Sarmash', is also successfully accompanying these four women.
The one-act play, described as a depressed comedy, promises to laugh without confusing.
What's left of the beautiful words that come out of Perran's mouth, mostly played by Shebnem Sönmez, is this: they read plagiarism; they live, they see.
All the kids thought they'd die once to punish their parents, and for some reason, they always cried.
The woman hangs in the air like an obscure joke.
She's always looking for a funny story where she forgets her most important part.
In fact, every story begins with a kind of abandonment.
Sometimes I have to put my hands in my pocket; I can't stand things without pockets.
You don't know where to put your hands.
Our hands multiply when we're surprised.
People talk about what they don't understand, they make it up.
A misunderstanding becomes a reality.
All women are confused because they are confused.
Well, now that you've failed to die, you have a chance to live.
'Long live your appetite'
It can be consumed with confidence at all ages
"It's more nutritious than yogurt, because protein covers basic minerals and vitamin B," said Specialist Dietist Pınar Rule Enç, whose main ingredient is milk, which does not end in counting health benefits, but says that the more useful miraculous food kefir is one of the nutrients that he can consume with absolute confidence at any age than milk.
B1 is also rich in vitamin B12 and vitamin K.
Because of the calcium and magnesium content, it forms the basis for a healthy nervous system.
It's also a good source of phosphorus.
Kefir, who also has the ability to hold a tox, also doesn't care about weight.
"The food value is quite high and is an easy drink to digest," he said.
It's a cure for all trouble.
"Kefir is a local beverage made in Caucasus," explained the children, the elderly, the pregnant, and the women who enter menopause, who can consume kefir without hesitation.
But now he's starting to announce his name to Earth.
The secret of youth, the long and healthy potion of life, the kefir, is a cure for almost all trouble.
One of the most natural ways to keep babies away from metabolic diseases is the kefir.
A friend of the bowels
This unique drink, which does not end in counting the benefits, is a friend of the bowels.
We have 1,2 kilograms of bacteria and fungi in our intestines.
Microorganisms in the digestive system are also divided into two groups because they are useful and harmful.
Useful microorganisms are called 'probiotic microorganisms'.
The activities of the probiotics have as important an effect as our liver, and when sufficiently consumed, prevents harmful microorganisms in the intestines from sticking to and spreading into the bowel wall.
The destabilization of healthy microorganisms in the intestine causes many diseases.
The health of the digestive tract must be maintained in the right way of eating.
To do that, we must surely consume the probiotics in sufficient quantities.
It eliminates these problems in the bowel.
Kefir is food containing the most effective probiotic bacteria, and the useful bacteria within it have a tremendous impact on the strengthening of the bowel system.
It allows useful bacteria and fungi in the intestine to reproduce and be useful.
In regular kefir use, intestines work, bowel disorders disappear, swelling decreases, and a healthier digestive tract.
A healthy bowel system means a healthy, diseaseless body.
"The kefir, which is also good for such situations as lack of appetite, insomnia, upper airway infections and allergies, also helps infants receive better quality of vitamins and minerals from nutrients, so it also plays an important role in infant nutrition," he said.

Putin, he's licking his spit
Russia prepares to grant Turkish companies the status of "may do business with Russia" if Turkey fails to meet its services in another way, while the Russian Tour Operators Association has issued a statement saying "Russian citizens are not giving up on Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which calculates that removing existing economic ties with Turkey will cost Russia extra, has drafted and issued a new "Istential situation" bill on Turkey to the Russian government.
According to the draft published in the Russian Federal Regulation Fihrist, Turkish companies and companies are supposed to be allowed to do business with Russia even if necessary.
According to the draft, it is impossible to provide other sources other than Turkey, or the products and services of Turkish companies and companies can be used if domestic production in Russia will bring serious additional costs.
Which Turkish-based goods and services will be included in this category, and the Russian Ministry for Economic Development will determine a mixed commission that will be co-founded in partnership with other relevant ministries.
So it can be decided by choosing bureaucrats which Turkish company can work with Russia.
According to the same document, the state-owned and private companies in Russia will need to prove to the commission that their work with Turkish partners is not met.
If the draft is approved by the Russian government and comes into force, the registration of the privileged Turkish companies will also be created in Russia.
Russian Tour Operators Association also said yesterday that Russian citizens have not given up on Turkey.
The statement read: "Despite the ban on sale and the advice of the Russian Foreign Ministry to go to Turkey, our citizens have begun to look for the formula for organizing their holidays alone."
On social networks online, the number of articles titled 'The most practical and cheapest way to vacation in Turkey' is growing like avalanches.
The most common suggestion is to book hotels online and fly THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev described the price of oil, which dropped below $30, as "dramatic" development in terms of Russia.
"It was a very bad surprise for our government, as no one thought the oil would drop to $30.
At this rate, it seems impossible to meet the budget as it is now."
It's the last month of 2015 we left behind.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announces that economic sanctions will deepen further following the plane crash.
In those days, our businessmen, our THY staff, who were trying to go to Russia in the usual order, are officially suffering at the border crossings.
Turkish goods are crawling through customs, under unimaginable control.
Not long ago, a month later, and yesterday, Nerdun Hacioglu of Moscow reports.
One way or another, the sanctions are getting soft.
But why?
The reason is very simple.
It's because in an era when the economy is so global, it's no longer your effort to close the border crossings with the methods of a century ago to turn political strife into an economic war.
Look, we're still writing stories about how the economic embargo that's been imposed on Iran for years has been breached.
Two neighbouring countries, like Russia and Turkey, who seem to have a lot of friends, but aren't at the core, are actually in need of each other.
It's not technically possible for you to separate these two countries from each other on a night like that, which is fused with a businessman, a tourist, an entrepreneur, a client.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter each other's country through a chimney.
It's best to settle the political debate on the table without the sanctions creating new Reza Zarrabs.
Without any interference in the economy...

This issue must be discussed first, and Russia needs its help in that scope.

Gossip Cauldron: No incompatibility in Celtic
While Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place and will overcome it, Griffith ignores the words of dissonance in Celtic.
Heart struggle, SFA's punishment for Neilson, and Warburton's shyness in the face of January signings disrupting the team's unity.
Leading Dons raise points with Celtic to five
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half brought Aberdeen a just win against the Dons at Pittodrie, giving the Dons an opportunity to make a five-point difference between themselves and Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about the word "incompatibility."
He pushes the rhetoric that creates a rumor of dissonance in Celtic with the reverse of Griffith's hand, and expresses that he and his teammates were never forced under an increased sense of monitoring as they prepared to face the Dutch League Leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The fact that the Scots don't have a title race bothers the Dutch de Boer
Ronald de Boer, a former midfielder for Rangers and former international famed player for Dutch football, says Dutch football enthusiasts lost interest in Celtic as they ran out of competition with Rangers.
De Boer, already an Ajax envoy, said: "They no longer give outlines of Celtic matches in the Netherlands, why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People aren't just talking about the Rangers making a comeback.
They're talking about the old team.
They're talking about the teams together, they're dealing with it.
The tension was high in the Old Team's matches, and it wasn't just the Scots who wanted to watch those games.
Deila swore I'd make things right.
RONNY Deila admitted Celtic was struggling, but the Norwegian boss stated that the departure would reverse.
The defeat against Malmö and then right after the farewell to the Champions League followed the match against Aberdeen of 10, who was now in the lead position by five points on the scoreboard.
Deila, however, said, "Celtic has been through a lot in the past, and we will return."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know the situation is very disappointing, and I know a lot of people are angry or upset about what's going on.
We're in the same situation - but we have to keep going.
We really, really need Celtic support because it makes these players feel so much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton's shyness of January transfers
Despite his comments that he set some January transfer targets just a few weeks ago, Rangers' boss Mark Warburton hesitates to sign, insisting that Ibrox does not want to break up his team union.
His former Brentford teacher said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For the players who come in the summer, there's a preseason period where you get them used to it, which we saw in our own group this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes it hurts more to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
He's targeting Celtic Michu for retirement.
Michu, one of the Swansea strikers, connected with Celtic in the transfer window, and frustrated predictions that he might retire when his contract with the Swans ended.
When he was 29 years old, he suffered unbearable pain from a troubled ankle for two years and found no way to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA battle over Neilson's comments
When Paterson was kicked out of the game, the Hearts were 2–1 ahead and then lost 3–2, reversing everything after the defender's red card- Collum's third red card to be cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up what he says, he persists in his insistence: "I have never questioned the union, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths tried to stop Tynecastle.
Obsessed Hibee was scolded when he sang a song containing offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014 in Tynecastle in a bar in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh prior to the Edinburgh derby.
"It was a derby game and that moment had warmth," said the offensive player, adding, "I can definitely say that I will not go to Tynecastle except to play games with Celtic from now on.
Tannadice board trusts Dundee United administration - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly, the board of Dundee United still has confidence that the board of directors will fix things - but they agree that the fall in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the kids ready to go again." Donnely said.
Mclness is pleased with the "ugly win" against Hamiltona.
Derek Mclness admits that the Aberdeen team had to hold desperately against the Hamilton Accies to see Celtic's seventh consecutive wins in the league, which led them to the top over five points, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
Mclnnes said: "There's no team in the middle that won anything without winning a game in this way, whether it's trophies or leagues."
In Britain, unemployment rates increased, while the proportions among Scots remained the same.
In Scotland, the number of unemployed people across the UK increased to 1.82 million while the employment remained unchanged between May and July with 164,000.
According to the National Statistical Office (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent higher than the 5.5 per cent in the UK.
On the other hand, employment in Scotland fell 12,000 within three months, with the current number of employees remaining 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland dropped to 74.0 per cent - the figure is above the average in the UK at 73.5 per cent.
State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures: "The government's long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It has been almost a full year since Scotland decided to remain part of England.
In these 12 months we have seen developments in the Scottish Business Force market with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why am I a witness to an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, I'm going to watch a man get killed due to a late legal intervention.
I hope not, but if it does, I'm gonna sit in the death row gallery at Oklahoma State Penitentiary while Richard Glossip is executed with lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made through his best friend in January, and as shocked as I was, I accepted.
The closer I got that day, the more scared I got.
So why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death sentence.
It will present a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and as there are more applications than current places, a terrible lottery appears as they decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced its media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever gets elected will watch without feeling that way.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna sit next to Richard Glossip's best friends, and I've developed a relationship with him over the past few months as a result of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Officials at the prison said I couldn't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be given pencils and notebooks to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of compromising my neutrality over Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, gain access.
I complained to him.
He admitted that "he could have said it better", but still thinks what I did was wrong.
Richard Glossip disagrees with me in some of the things I say and write.
He won't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime he wanted.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write it down.
If he dies, he thinks spreading it to the public will help the anti-death penalty movement.
A reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware will be with me.
If you'd like to know more about this, please listen to my podcast series.
I'm not going to go over all the details here again.
I have no clear idea Richard Glossip is innocent.
What Barry Van Treese did after his death was enough to make him an accomplice.
But I still believe he's not guilty of murder.
I believe there is absolutely not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm going to watch him die with that perspective.
I can't really claim to be objective.
You can look at the other reporters there for that.
The impressions you'll get from me will be the impression you'll get from watching a man he likes die who's killed unnecessarily.
After a wet police chase, the man was convinced of the Canning River.
Canning Vale remained dry as the police officer convinced the man out of the Canning River.
The claim to escape from the police car behind a Perth man ended in the shallow and muddy water, with a police officer trying "to convince himself to kindly come back to shore".
Canning Vale police were called in Tuesday due to a break-in incident in Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to escape the police by entering the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"The senior Assistant Commissioner Shandell Castledine, himself, stood in the water and said 'I won't go out, 'Come get me'"
Police Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiation".
Senior Assistant Commissioner Castledine said, "Sometimes people try funny things to try to escape."
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a catchy example.
In 2006, a Cousins cop abandoned his car to avoid alcohol control and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but he inspired locals to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon for joke purposes.
Peter Moody claimed that the stewards had ratted him out and threatened him to quit the race.
Peter Moody claimed that the Racing Victoria stewards tried to draft a layout in their stables last year and threatened him to leave the race immediately.
Racing targeted the Victorian stewards and unity department and said they were conducting a personal campaign against him to take Lady Tatai out of the race in the final feed for the race on Wednesday before the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always in an effort to do the best in racing, and told Lidari that he found himself in difficult conditions that he could not explain when the job gave him a cobalta positive result.
He said he had been biting his tongue for 18 months in the face of allegations of snitching that he did not want to "look like a drunken grape".
"I wasn't going to say any of this, and I covered it up for a long time, but sometimes you get so angry and it just happens all of a sudden," Moody said.
They know this is going on.
Sometimes you react, and you suffer the consequences, and I will suffer the consequences of what I say.
I'll sleep well when I get home tonight.
I want to walk around with my head held high, and my bosses know that I'm trying my best for them.
When they start to think I didn't do it, it means I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
I'd think about what I'd do with my license.
Previously, Moody had detonated a bomb in a racing.com interview accusing the unit department of being in his own barn in a snitch effort.
"Thirty months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man—I'll name it if asked—and they offered him a job in my stables in exchange for them telling them what I was doing in the stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a con man.
If that's the case, they all need to return their bras because they weren't talented enough to catch me.
Former president of the RVL, Robert Roulston, new president of the RVL, David Moodie, and current general manager of the RVL knew that at the time, and now they know it.
Does that make me think you're being personal?
The RVL has a series of balls, and maybe it wants to make anyone but the trainers responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and throw me out, but I have no doubt what I'm saying will make them think.
But where I come from, I don't care about anything, and it makes me sad.
It really upsets me.
I'm gonna put pressure on them, I'm gonna put them in charge of making decisions.
I have the support of my family and I walk away.
The long-standing cobalt investigation involving the trainer's Lidari and his disappointment over the subsequent scratch incident made him "throw my license across the table."
Moody, famous for preparing the unbeaten champion Kara Caviar, described the race day maintenance rule as "funny", stating that it was against the rules that mud or clay porridge should be put on the horse's feet.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this."
One of my men accidentally put the mud on his foot.
He could have taken it last night.
He could have had it yesterday, which he did.
He took race day.
Moody may face a three-month suspension for using porridge in race day maintenance as a result of an investigation by the executives.
This is a joke.
Those who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We understand we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The hit-and-run driver was arrested in Cobram
Police arrested the man who ran into a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist had been lifted from the air to Royal Melbourne Hospital due to serious injuries after a car hit him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver who hit fled the scene without helping the injured.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalie surrendered to the police station in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping in an accident, not helping, and other traffic crimes.
At the age of 40, the Cobram cyclist remains stable in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responded harshly to his opponents' claims about wrestling
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy described the criticisms targeting his own team as the "day creation" effort for the NRL's two favorite titles.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said in the semi-finals in Sydney on Friday night that the referees allowed him to "fight" with his own team in a match where Storm was defeated.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a not-so-overlay reference to Storm following his team's semi-final game against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, describing that game as a "demonstration" match for rugby league and saying that the two Oueenslands were not "too big" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's struggle and said they focused solely on the "themas" while fighting.
Bellamy said that he was powered by criticism from two leading teachers to his team, as this meant they were concerned that Storm would defeat them.
This is going on - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2, Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year long, we've only made a real emphasis on our combat contacts in the last six weeks, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and obviously there's a big team he's been teaching, and he's probably not used to losing with a little shock for himself.
It's funny that this happened this time of year.
Bellamy opposed Bennett's idea of "exciting football", reminiscent of Bennett's 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons winner playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He made it the subject of comparing our Friday night match with his own games on Saturday night, and how exciting was their game," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he wouldn't even give me a rat's ass.
But now they have a team that we can call exciting football, and especially with their speed and their young half.
This is the kind of football you want to play when you have players like this.
In 2010, he made this point, and now everybody wants to play football like this -- not every team has halfs like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play like that.
It gives me more confidence because even they talk like that because they're a little shy of playing.
When they went to the big games, they probably didn't think of us six weeks ago.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Roosters match had a higher score than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen him yet, but what was his score?
Our game is 20 to 18, both sides score more at our game, but is this exciting football?
Or is it exciting to cut off attacks but not make score-breaking attacks?
That's the agenda for me.
If they're talking about us, that means we'll meet them here at a later stage.
Storm is absent this weekend as he won the right to host one of the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks at AAMI Park on Saturday night in his first final game on Tuesday.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail over drug charge
The man who was smuggled into Queensland, caught on 40 kilograms of cocaine and facing a possible life sentence, was released on bail for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five captured last month by the federal police who tracked the 100kg of drugs from South America via Vanuatu and from the Solay yacht, which was launched into port in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen in a meeting with his accomplices at the marina during the morning and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where police found 40 kilograms of drugs inside a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of facing a potential life sentence for possession of commercial amounts of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer said there was no evidence that he had attempted to have all the drugs and that he could have been in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk.
He has open connections to Serbia.
He travels frequently to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
He lied about where he was staying with the police on the public case.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather offered $200,000 together to bail him out.
Judge Flanagan said that "after reading both people's affidavits, it is clear that the $200,000 bail price constitutes a real financial burden on them."
However, he warned that this was not enough alone to keep him from taking the case.
Maksimovic was released on bail in exchange for delivering both Australian and Serbian passports, going to the police station every day, and following a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to lure the pedophiles to the video.
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, taking a session in an online messaging service, providing her with a series of inappropriate children's images sent to her by another user.
The girl then woke up and realized she had no phone and found her phone in the hands of sleeping Hogg.
He looked at her and immediately noticed disturbing messages before warning his mother.
Police were interested and saw five pictures, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered "interested" web searches made using terms intended to find inappropriate children's pictures.
Hogg later claimed that the reason why he did this to officers was to "manage the pedophiles" on the Internet and "become police and scare them".
Financial deputy Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court: "He said it's an addiction - an addict who scares people.
He admitted that the calls were made by the computer, but said he did it to act like a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked questions about talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures, who asked him to send more pictures.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said that when he drank, he got sick ideas and wanted to watch videos of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When she found the messages on her phone, she screamed at her mother and she was shaking and crying.
The mother saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, and the accusations followed.
The girl was interviewed and the girl said she used computer and PlayStation to appear younger than the defendant was.
Hogg, 23, who lives in Ward Road, Dundee, was found guilty of taking or producing inappropriate children's pictures on June 14 last year, violating bail on January 25 this year, and failing to attend court this year on March 24.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim said that it could be discussed if Hogg was not included in the category of sexual crimes because there was no "obvious sexual element" in this crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the case to October, when a social background study report will be given.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but was kept in custody for other unusual cases.
There was a record of sexual crimes prior to the date of sentencing.
Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe misspeaks in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest leader in Africa, fell down the stairs earlier this year as he came down a runway.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament had been tarnished by opposition lawmakers' claims that if they booed him during Mr Mugabe's speech, they had received anonymous death threats.
In his address to the nation in parliament last month, they booed him and interrupted him constantly - he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), announced that seven opposition politicians received messages on their cell phones so they would not disturb him during Mr Mugabe's speech.
"After Mr Mugabe's speech is over, the message to reporters comes from an unseen number but its title is 'death'," he said.
He tells members that their immunity is valid within parliament and that immunity does not work when they leave parliament.
The chief spokeswoman said he was "worried" by threats against the party's politicians, led by Morgan Tsvangirai.
Hewlett-Packard will cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will end 25,000 to 30,000 jobs, with efforts to rebuild and reduce costs in corporate service.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year; the computer and printer will separate their business from faster-growing hardware and service operations.
HP reported in a statement that the expected layoffs would result in a cost of around $2.7 billion at the start of the fourth quarter.
"These reconstruction activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company," said Meg Whitman, chairman and executive head of the HP, who will head the post-separation unit.
"Whitman, Hewlett Packard Company will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep portfolio to help companies move on to their new style of business," he said.
As a separate company, we are in a much better position to meet the developing needs of our clients worldwide.
According to a statement from the company, the Hewlett Packard Company's annual income will be more than $50 billion and will "focus on offering integrated technology solutions without interest" for companies.
His garages in Palo Alto are called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley" and he divides the company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electric equipment.
HP is undergoing a major reorganization to deal with transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world's largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technology firms in the United States, is one of the latest moves in the industry in the belief that tight-focused firms perform better.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says Wilshere's teammates had problems with his injuries prior to Dinamo Zagreb match
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's injury occurred in September and that his treatment was planned, with no reason for him not to play at Christmas times.
The best scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least four games in the UK, and given his background, it is unclear whether he will attend the European Championships next summer.
The most embarrassing thing about the last problem is that Wilshere finished the last season strong after a separate ankle injury, followed by a search for his previous sharpness.
This kind of injury is not a threatening career, Wenger said.
It's a bone that hasn't fully healed.
It's no big deal.
It was just an accident.
This has nothing to do with his wrists or his previous injuries.
According to a medical perspective, these may be true, but as Wenger would agree, there is also a danger of further injury for a midseason returner.
There's also a disturbing pattern developing.
According to the study by premiere Injuries Ltd, Wilshere has had 23 different ailments recorded since its inception six years ago.
He played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
In the big picture, Arsenal has been one of two First Division teams to lose in six out of eight seasons since 2007–08, often due to injury.
Wenger accepts a vicious cycle potential, but Arsenal believes that it will continue to improve in last season's injury record.
"Sometimes during your return from an injury, you experience a period of openness to injury, a process in which you want to strengthen your body and win the fight," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I trust that, and I believe he will make the career he deserves.
Arsenal, who will start the Champions League fight Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, has Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur games to play next Wednesday, preparing the Wenger team for them.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't go to Croatia, which means he's going to play Arteta with Mathieu Debuchy.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud replacing Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to protect the fence and give the players the breath they need," said Wenger.
Arsenal's Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most feared stadiums in Europe, although it is an open favourite of Group F.
Dinamo has not been defeated for 41 games after producing his own "No-defeat" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken Tuesday night by a magnitude 3.2 earthquake on the Richter scale.
This is the 10th tremor in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned the lesson from the defeat against Monaco in the Champions League last season, and continues to motivate the club with its remote goal of achieving its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is enormous," says Wenger.
It's never been like this in Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I've had enough experience to be realistic.
We're passionate, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about men's friendship
The absence of similar ports in programs is remarkable, especially at a time like this when men need more to open up and suicide rates among young men are at the height of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the largest cause of male deaths between the ages of 20 and 45; and it was three times more in men than women.
To draw attention to this problem, the Undesirable Against Living Campaign (CALM) has declared 2015 a Male Year and aims to oppose the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
In order to accomplish this difficult task, friendship is at the center of the struggle.
A study among high school students with more than 2,000 depressive symptoms showed that if the person suffering from this boredom had a high number of "healthy" friends, their chances of recovery had doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves mental difficulties that may arise.
But, of course, for friendship to work, it has to be accessible first.
In this age of social media weighted communication; with focus on style rather than content, making emergency response rather than meaningful communication a priority.
Our digital lives doubled the need to look like strong, fun-loving and successful people — even if in reality everything is about isolation.
Artificial success is dominated by what psychologists call externally motivated values; money, image, social status; in pursuit of them, inner values with deeper impacts on our mental health—our inner longing for personal development and friendship—is being wasted.
As a billionaire video game creator recently explained, money does not buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was to turn this focus upside down.
Characters were defined not by their work but by their personality; and they were also revealing this by their interaction with their friends.
Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the minutes they watched football in comfortable chairs, Ross' attachments to Rachel all came from the knowledge that they could actually relate to them, even if they were all in the background to fully explain how men felt.
What a benevolent employee tells me is that when I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I see how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference."
Most of the men who contact us can't talk to their friends.
It's a very strong feeling of "going away", and so is the idea that opening up to others is a sign of weakness."
One of the programs I can think of when I propose long-term coping mechanisms is Friends.
He emphasized the small moments of male friendship.
On my goal, a foreign status on the phone helps people when they are in a difficult situation; but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you join FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful setting where scenes are redesigned for celebration?
Or, better yet, if you see anyone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You don't know what a difference your friendship will make.
Friends, from start to finish on Comedy Central - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria made it easy for PSG to beat Malmö with a goal
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani following a goal for Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made it easier for the PSG to beat his opponent on Tuesday, when he scored for Swedish team Malmö at the start of the Champions League.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the match.
In the target match of Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani, Paris Saint-Germain began the Champions League fight on Tuesday with a 2–0 extremely comfortable and clear win against Malmö at Parc des Princes stadium.
Di Maria became a PSG player who led the French champion to move on in the Champions League with his goal before four minutes was up, but in the 61st minute they could not seize the opportunities until Cavani scored with his head.
Paris, along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, not only to get out of qualifying groups but also to improve their quarterfinal performances in the final three championships.
But the game they played for Laurent Blanc's team was not the best of the era, Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of positions around the penalty area and was later sidelined against his hometown's team, where he began his glorious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win whether it's inside or out in the Champions League, it'll be a problem for our opponents to win 2-0 in that respect, and although there are some things we need to improve during the season, it's a good start to give a comfortable look back," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
Despite my regret that we had not scored one or two more goals, we wanted to win and we won.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team with one of three player changes in a 2–2 game against Bordeaux in the 1st Division at the end of the week, but was shadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When the Argentine winger was transferred from Manchester United last month, he was seen as the player to bring the PSG to a higher level in Europe, and Marco Veratti's pass showed that those who thought so were not wrong as he ran behind the Malmö defense and sent Johan Wiland from the far corner to the nets.
However, everyone was disappointed while waiting for the PSG to win a great victory.
To move to this round, Malmö had been lined up with nine international players who eliminated Celtic in the play off, with a five-man defense and two midfield deep players, a heavy-standing opponent.
In the 34th minute, they made very few attacks, except for the shot at Nikola Djurdjic, which grazed the pole of the corner that Kevin Trapp was protecting.
PSG, on the other hand, gave them the opportunity to slow down the game with unnecessary passes and inefficient final innings, the first half, when Ibrahimovic failed to make the finishing move in at least five attacks and failed to keep up with Cavani's game when the second half began.
However, when he came to organize his co-workers, he showed that he was more proficient, in the 52nd minute, it was Ibrahimovic who passed the pass of the curved kick that Di Maria sent to Wiland's castle.
The second goal came through Cavani after a full hour was up, with Uruguayan player scoring his sixth goal of the season with Maxwell's head revealed from the left wing after Ibrahimovic's pass.
Malmö ran out of ideas that he would go back to the game, and after a goal that was not considered by Ezequiel Lavezzi, who entered the game afterwards, he saved David Luiz's shot in the vacant position perfectly and did not allow the score to change.
He later admitted that Malmö coach Age Hareide PSG was a class superior to his own team, the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions league match was in December of last year."
Since then, we've only played ball in the Swedish League, not on the same level as him.
The teams in the qualifier aren't enough.
A hat is taken off to Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion in stock sales.
Glencore, a Swiss-based mining giant, was hit by the price of processed goods that fell, and made $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling his shares as part of his plan to divide his debts.
Listed in London, Glencore announced that he had sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off his own debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, was severely affected by the price of goods falling due to China's economic slowdown causing an increase in demand and causing confusion in markets.
The issue of rights caused Glencore's stock prices to rise on the London stock market early Wednesday morning.
The shares opened 0.69 per cent higher in the FTSE 100 index, increasing by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale plan, which was part of his plans to reduce the 30 billion debt stack by a third.
The company sold its new stocks for 125 pence per share, which was 2.4 per cent off compared to Tuesday's closing.
It sold 1.3 billion shares, equivalent to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about China's longstanding growth cut iron ore prices roughly halfway; coal, copper and other goods fell between 20 and 40 percent.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
The White House confirmed Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping would make an official visit to the United States at the end of the month.
The statement said that this visit, Xi's first official trip to Washington, would take place on September 25, and was a return visit to Barack Obama, who arrived in Beijing last November.
Following bilateral talks by the two heads of state, US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will give a dinner in honor of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan.
The statement also stressed that "President Xi's visit will expand US-China co-operation on two countries' relations as well as regional and global issues and allow President Obama and President Xi to address issues that are in dispute constructively".
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop by Seattle before Washington to meet with some US technology leaders, and then move to New York City to join the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are also expected to address some controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about claims that China is conducting cyber espionage activities and China's claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon makes the diversity of filmmaking seem insignificant.
Matt Damon opposed African-American filmmaker Effie Brown, saying that it was not necessary to be behind camera during a discussion of diversity.
In the Project Greenlight Sunday night episode on HBO, Brown interrupted the veteran actor while emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives on the black main character in the project's selected script.
Damon claimed that when we talked about diversity, you would do it not in the cast of the show, but in the cast of the film.
Shocked, Brown reacted that the actor of the Martian film was against it with statements such as "Uh! Wow. Okay."
Damon and Brown had been brought together by co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
Brown first said, "I wanted to make people think about how they would treat the character of Harmony - no matter who the director was."
The only black character is a prostitute who was shot by a white parakeet.
The publisher of the beloved White People insisted on finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film, Damon responded that their assignment could "end up in ways we didn't want."
After the discussion was released, there was an explosion of discontent with Damon's comments on social media.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at cutting it down by writing, "Matt Damon can explain his diversity of this person as BEYAZ ISE pains because he talks about the only black person in the room."
After tweet was sent, it received 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments came at the time when the correct racial expression in the media was at the forefront of social debates.
After being killed in 2014 by a young white police officer named Michael Brown, the Black Life Important movement has effectively encouraged lawmakers and officials to stop their discrimination against colored people across the country.
In February, singer Prince spoke of the move in a top-down way while the Grammy Awards introduced Album of the Year nominees.
He said the albums are still important.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Life Important movement issued a statement in response to Elisabeth Hasselbeck, an important figure on Fox News, asking if the group should be considered a hate group.
The leaders said that Black Life Matters. The Network is a love group.
It had recently been announced that Damon had been included on the list of show artists, producers and media patrons invited to visit the Pope to discuss the identification of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's not clear if he's accepted the invitation or if he's met with the Pope yet.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowned his first champion
Professional rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero won the American Ninja Warrior program Monday night, becoming the first athlete to receive the $1 million award.
Entering his 7th season, this competition had never seen a contestant who could complete all stages on the obstacle course.
In the season finale, Caldiero and Geoff Britten made it to the final round.
The last mission was to climb a rope of about 20 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete this course in time, and thus managed to become the first athlete to complete the American Ninja Warrior's difficult 4th stage; however, Caldiero prevailed by finishing this course three seconds before him.
Following this difficult win, Caldiero spoke to E.News in shock of having won the $1 million grand prize.
Isaac told E! about a big raise on his salary, saying, "I think it's great to think about it, I've never made or made more than $10,000 a year."
I mean, it just happened... I can't imagine what it would be like... the future.
Producer Kent Weed also discussed the final with The Hollywood Reporter and explained why no awards would be given, although Britten was the first contestant to finish the course.
According to the rules, money is given to the fastest.
"If anyone finishes more than one, whoever does it the fastest wins the prize," Weed said.
Even though money was a great prize and changed lives, he also won a big bonus.
I don't think he has a bad idea about it.
He's so happy he did what he did.
He got tons of credit from his fans.
He's a great guy and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone's gonna beat me, I'm glad it's Isaac."
I think Isaac would have thought the same thing if his roles had changed.
The American Ninja Warrior renewed the contract for season eight, and filming will begin in Spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers narrowly beat the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season wasn't much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers, once one of the best in baseball, are now ranked last in the Central League of America.
The Tigers, which reduced their game to corruption, managed to beat the Minnesota Twins 5–4 at Target Field on Tuesday, making a perfect game.
The Twins lost their chance to advance to the American Second League wild-card, surpassing the half point difference between him and the Houston Astros.
For Detroit, the situation was a return to the good game, which was rarely seen in most of the second half of the season, even for one night.
In the words of the Tigers' manager Brad Ausmus, "Any way the victories are all pleasant."
Tigers' pitcher Alfredo Simon managed to score one in the sixth and ninth innings, showing early offensive support with Detroit scoring three times in the first two innings.
Simon (13-9) pitched six 3/1 innings innings, three of which were runs.
This was only his third quality start in his last nine rounds.
"I just want to close the year strong," Simon said.
It's hard for those in reserve to waste every game, so I wanted to dive deeper into the game.
Victor Martinez, the Tigers' selected batsman, pitched three innings, and the two were runs, which became the first RBI to win since mid-August.
This was Martinez' first three-hitter night since his four innings against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He shook the bat hard," said Ausmus.
He looked good (in batting practice), he was already visibly better at BP, which he continued in the game as well.
At the end of the seventh inning line-up, Twins had the best chance to get back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton started the batting line by doubles in the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks was only able to bat a slow shot and Simon caught second baseman BrianDozier swinging for left-handed BlaineHardy to bat.
Mauer, two - the only player to stand up to batsman Miguel Sano, who passed right winger Drew VerHagen in the run, boldly advanced.
With a pair of runners in the second tying run, VerHagen managed to pull third baseman Trevor Plouffe into a double game.
Plouffe's kick to the DP was the 27th in the major leagues this season.
After Detroit struggled for the run to guarantee ninth place, Mauer crossed RBI and opened up a gap with the Tigers and approached Bruce Rondon, making 5–4.
However, he was caught in Sano in three launches for the right fifty-fifth save.
Detroit took advantage with Phil Hughes' early release, who had lost his form.
The Tigers won three runs in their first two shots against the experienced right-handed player who had been off the field for over a month due to backburning and had just come out of injury.
"That's not the game I want to play, frankly," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable in the sequel and managed to make quite a good throw in the third pitch."
Once he had a successful shot, Hushes took second baseman Ian Kinsler out of the game.
The loss of right fielder J.D. Martinez twice left Victor Martinez alone in the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez competed with the runners to cross the 0-21 band in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos watched with a single shot to the right, winning another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown off when he wanted to make the third, thus ending the threats.
The Tigers added in the second, winning an out pair from catcher James McCann and a two-out 3-0 from midfielder Anthony Gose as well.
Paul Molitor, the Twins' manager, said it was a "big hit".
He didn't hit it very well, but he threw it in the right place.
Counting shots, Hughes scored three shots that did not score until he was replaced with right-handed rescuer A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs in six innings and four non-hitters.
The Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was out of the game due to the pain in his shoulder that he used to throw.
In 2007, he will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez' shoulder surgery.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to shoulder pain, was scheduled to start work on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, he will begin with the LHP Daniel Norris DL against the Twins.
The Tigers are 1-1 with Norris in four games since the July 30 match for the David Price transfer.
He hasn't played since August 20th because of the pains on the right.
The Tigers and Twins will end their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), Minnesota RHP will fight Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open the economy to the world more.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with managing reforms that the economy needs to be opened more to accelerate growth.
"China must develop its opening policies by specializing in foreign investment," the President said at the 16th Centre's Front Coming Group meeting to Strengthen General Reforms.
While promoting opening, Xi said that making new reforms would bring new energy and vitality, creating a new area for economic growth.
The leader group adopted a number of proposals, such as the negative list regulating market access, relaxation in border control policies, encouraging the state-owned organizations (SOE) to incorporate private capital, and a review of the resident's registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that defines the banned sector and business sectors for investment.
The system will be tested phase by stage and developed by test programs.
This is an important move, as it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources and will make the market more open by providing a law-based business environment.
The government will also loosen its control over companies, allowing companies to run their own business.
This statement also states that China will study new cross-border economic co-operation models in border areas and that new mechanisms will be activated to encourage regional growth.
To open sectors controlled by the state, more space will open for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment, and will offer better services to foreign-funded companies by protecting their interests," the statement said.
In addition, the requirements for foreigners to receive continuous residential permits or "green card" will be facilitated by optimizing and application processes being put on a path.
The guaranteeing of legalists' rights to practice and raising professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at the meeting.
According to a statement released after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
The miniature bag is now very trendy-Time Newspaper Friday's Sunday.
In the fashion world, the roads go round and round in bags.
The current that's been prominent lately is the miniature ones...
It's possible that the little bags attached to the adults also draw attention.
They say the little ones are beautiful.
I guess that goes for the bags, too.
When he couldn't get enough of walking down the streets with bags in his suitcase size, suddenly the wind started blowing in the opposite direction, and the bags tended to shrink.
We already had the little bags, but this time they came up with the size of their big handbags.
Only your phone, credit card and key will fit in these tiny bags.
Beginning with Céline and Hermès, the current spread with Prada.
The transformation of bag admiration into miniature curiosity also affected the emerging models.
Loewe presented the fun bags he prepared this season in two lengths.
Of the panda, polar bear and elephant-shaped bags, the elephant-looking ones stand out the most.
The mini-lengths of large bags offered by luxury brands with phenomenon names seem to have attracted the most red carpet celebrities again.
Hermes' "Birkin" bag, dedicated to Jane Birkin, is one of the most preferred.
Although Jane Birkin said she didn't want her name to be mentioned in a briefcase with a press release, but that's how it's in the memories now.
Fashion weeks, however, helped massise the mini-bag stream.
And on the podiums, mini-bags stand out.
You can't possibly wear them because they're so tiny.
They can be used in cross form with their long hangers.
But on the podiums, we saw those long straps wrapped around models' wrists.
Fendi's one of those guys that's taking the mini-bag thing to a head start.
He has a suggestion for those who can't fit in the mini bag but can't give them up.
Friends mini-bags for big bags.
How?
By turning the mini bags into a bag ornament that can be attached to their elders.
This prominent presentation on the podiums has quickly paid off on the street.
Let's see what else we can see!
Skin change in skin
Turkey is capable of competing with world brands on the issue of denim.
He's enriching his experience in production with design now.
Loft's one of them.
We see that black models, which used to have a few, are now taking their place on shelves every season.
In the season when blacks went up so high, the drills found their best friend.
Skin fragments and leather detailed designs stand out as rebellious friends of denims.
Short models with zippers, generally called motorbike, are on the agenda.
While the strong air of the skin is again complete by black pieces; chiffon long blouses, sparkling sweatshirts provide a sportly appearance.
In the old days, young people wore clothes and wanted to get lost in the crowd.
It was supposed to save the day.
Now young people want to carry on a piece that emphasizes style as well as comfort.
In this respect, it is possible to say that Loft correctly understands the target audience with his collections and complementary pieces.
Little step for Banksy, big step for "global"
The world premiere of the collection "The Art of Banksy", which incorporated works by mystery street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
The first exhibition of the Global Karaköy building, the product of the artist's 15-year work, where 85 original works met for the first time.
Mysterious street artist Bansky's first exhibition in Istanbul opened in Global Karaköy (Street Street) the previous day.
The world-renowned artist, who hid his identity and used a patron name, of course, wasn't at the opening.
We don't know if he came to Istanbul.
But the curator of the exhibition, Steve Lazaridas, says Bansky doesn't even know about this exhibit.
There's no reason to ask him for permission.
Because Bansky and Lazaridas, an old friend, left after 12 years.
Some of the exhibited works were collected from Lazaridas and some from collectors.
But there are things that the Bansky followers are curious about.
What would Banksy think of the "The Art of Banksy" exhibition where his 85 works were put together?
What would he say if he saw the small store that was created at the end of the 800-square-foot gallery?
Would the Red Balloon Girl, the Cleaner, the Rose now make a sound that her work, noting the world’s wounds, was printed on cloth bags, wallets, necklaces were made?
The fact that the exhibition of an artist with an anarchist spirit who conceals his identity has become such a consumer ingredient, is disappointing for Banksy followers.
That's not Banksy's style.
But you still get the limited number of tickets before they run out!
For Banksy, the great exhibition for the small, globalized world "The Art of Banksy" can be seen until April.
They're mean, cruel.
Why don't you go dig a ditch?
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has continued his reaction to academics signing the statement.
"They are cruel, they are despicable."
Indeed, those who are with the wrongdoers are wrongdoers.
"They committed the same crime because they were with the murderers".
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who left carnations instead of the explosion in Sultanahmet, said, "In this act in Sultanahmet Square, a place of peace that smells like history and civilization -- and not least near the German Fountain -- I have shared our regrets with the German President and the German Chancellor for the death of 10 German friends in such a region.
And I would like to express my condolences to all the German people first to the families of those who died."
"Our fight against terrorism will continue decisively".
Erdoğan, who continued his reaction to the academics who signed the declaration, said: "I particularly condemn the academics who stood up in the face of all these terrorist incidents and signed a black declaration under those massacres, and I strongly condemn them."
Just because our nation understands who's who — a professor, a professor — doesn't make anyone enlightened.
These are dark people.
These are the unjust, and these are the low ones.
They committed the same crime because they were with the massacrers.
So, in the incident in Cınar, where will these dark academics put the three-year-old Mevlüde, who died with his father?
How do they fit their consciences to stand by his murderers?
I invite all judicial authorities, the senate of universities, to serve because of these actions contrary to our constitution and laws.
Yesterday, I said the steps needed to be taken quickly.
Whatever they're gonna do, they're gonna do it there.
Those who want to make politics, let them make politics in parliament.
But if they can't do it in parliament, let them go, dig a ditch or go up the mountain.
I'm being so clear.

'I found 26 men looking for two wrestler children'
Mete Gumurhan's second documentary, "Young Pehlivans", 66.
It was the first Turkish documentary to be selected for the "Generation Lplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival (11–21 February).
Gumurhan, originally Edirneli but a production company in the Netherlands, described why and how he filmed the documentary, which he completed his filming in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Pehlivans", which tells the story of six Amasian boarding school students who aim to become world champions in wrestling, will compete in the Berlin Film Festival's "Generation Kplus".
Young Pehlivans, the first Turkish documentary selected for this episode, is one of the nominees for the Crystal Bear award.
Born and raised Dutch, but originally Edirneian director Mete Gumurhan.
When he was a kid, he heard stories of oil wrestling from his grandfather in Turkey, where he came for summer holidays, and watched the competitions.
"There are not only political problems in Turkey."
I wanted to tell the world what else happened in Anatolia.
"For example, wrestling from our ancestral sports is unfortunately not known," he wants to meet with six directors and prepare a documentary project.
This project is inconclusive, but one day the magazine news he reads on the plane opens the door to another project to Gumurhan.
'We're encamped in the sugar factory'
Mete Gumurhan, a 10-11-year-old wrestler who traces the article mentioning two younger brothers, goes to Samsun, where the family lives.
The children's father won't allow filming for the documentary.
Gumurhan describes how he overcame this challenge: "I've been thinking about what I can do all day.
Because support from the Ministry of Culture could have been withdrawn."
The father was talking about a boarding school in Amasya where the kids were going.
I thought of going there.
While I was looking for two children, I met 26 kids who were interested in wrestling at school.
We started filming in a week and finished the permits.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We were encamped in the sugar factory's dormitory."
The biggest challenge to the director of the documentary, which was completed in three weeks, was language.
"I didn't know what to expect when I was shooting," said Gumurhan, who said that three different languages were spoken on the set where the foreign cinematographer and the voice maker worked.
"They didn't speak Turkish either," he says.
Young Pehlivans focus on the story of six of the 26 children wrestlers.
Raised by his grandfather and having a weight problem, Baran, unable to participate in training because he broke his arm, Aaron, ambitious but with health problems, Bethlehem, the school's lovely boy Umit, the youngest champion Ahmet, and Muhammad, who kept the group together...
Mete Gumurhan describes working with children as: "I left them completely natural."
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
The first week and a half I was shooting at practice.
I wanted the kids to pretend they didn't have cameras.
"It's a good thing they got used to it."
It was a surprise to be elected to Berlin.
Mete Gumurhan, who said he did not expect the Young Pehlivans to be elected to the Berlin Film Festival, said, "We had preparation but it was a surprise that we were elected to Berlin."
Young Pehlivans are not a sports documentary, but a production that tells about children's struggles and conveys cuts from their lives.
"I wanted to highlight stories of children with family problems able to deal with their efforts to find identity and problems".
Support for academics from the art world
Following the declaration of the "Academies Initiative for Peace", the storm was due to investigate and detain academics yesterday, while statements of support are coming in one after another.
The first support came from literary people, including numerous famous names.
The other day, filmmakers and theater actors announced their support.
In a statement signed by 138 dramatists, "..as artists working in the field of theatre and performing-show arts, we stand beside this honorable meeting of academics calling for peace, declaring that we are on the side of freedom of expression, equality, right of life, and unconditional peace."
"We add our voice to the academics' call for negotiation and peace with our conscience and all our hearts".
More than 400 filmmakers including Deniz Türkali, Attila Özdemiroğlu, Nadir Sarıbaçak, Özcan Alper, Serra Yılmaz, Onur Celebrity, Yeshim Ustaoğlu, Pelin Çarşar, Tolga Karaçelik said, “We are on the side of free thinking and art.
But without but if: "We will not be a party to this crime!"
We are with the Academics Initiative for Peace," he supported the academics.
The Film Writers Association (SİYAD) also said, “We are with academics who have been made the target of the lynch campaign”.
The Academics for Peace Initiative called for peace and negotiations with the government on January 11th, with concurrent statements in Ankara and Istanbul, and issued a statement titled "We are not a party to this crime".
The text was signed by 1128 academics at 89 universities, as well as thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar, who had a worldwide reputation for his theories and books.
President Erdoğan and Prime Minister Davutoğlu have criticised the academics' declaration as "support for terror" and called for the authorities to do their duty.
Following this call, some universities had sacked academics, while the prosecution had launched an investigation.
A large number of academics were detained yesterday.
I'm a fan, please help!
Hürrem Sultan's red hair, Beren nose, Justin hair...
Trying to look like celebrities is considered to be normal to some extent, but it's seen as a psychological disorder after the point where it starts to affect life completely.
'Celebrity world system', a.k.a. 'sympathetic worship syndrome', is a topic that has already become an academic subject in the world, and we have just been spoken of.
Running into hair salons with famous photographs of ladies is only so normal.
But let's not forget the year of the Sultan of Hürrem, when all the teenagers were walking around with Irish red hair.
It's already been reported that Beren's nose was the lead in the plastic operations we left behind in 2015.
It's no different on the gentlemen's front.
At one point, dressed as Polat Alemdar was just a matter of manners.
Now it's the opposite wind.
We're surrounded by Justin Bieber's copy of teenagers.
So much so that this useless information that we quoted was read on the Internet thousands of times: "First, when you go to the barber's, cut the sides of your hair, the sides of your ears and the circumference, to the top of your head."
It'll be short on the side.
Once the cutting is done, you must shape your hair with light water.
Once the transmutation is done, stabilize your hair with spray help.
"Justin, to get the hair, you have to shape it when it's damp."
All of this has already become an academic subject in the world, and we have the newly spoken "Celebrity world syndrome", a.k.a., "worship of the proud."
Celebrity fans are seen as a ball of love in us.
Artists brag about their fan numbers, how much it affects them.
Fortunately, psychology doesn't see it that simple.
It is particularly controversial for adolescents to decide what to eat, what to listen to, what to wear, according to celebrities.
Excessive devotion to names presented as unreachable, role modelling is described as mental illness.
Expert psychologist Sumeyye Demir admits Turkey is behind in the work in this area.
However, he also does not miss that families are slowly becoming aware: "One of the main issues of psychology science is that one is at peace with oneself, that one finds peace within oneself."
At first, it wouldn't have been taken seriously to fill the children's room with posters, disguised as someone.
Well, that's changing now.
His parents feel the need to intervene.
"Fast devotion to one is a sign that something is wrong with the young man's life."
Fans riding the emotional roller coaster
The interest in celebrities is safe, provided it's not overkill.
Not wanting him to marry, jealous of his wife, preferring his clothing, Iron suggests paying attention to symptoms.
We're talking about famous people.
It's only natural to worry about them, to be interested in their lives.
But when the expert psychologist agrees, the young people who have missed the cantar's knob are in the majority: "When there are no names in family or surroundings to represent the child at the point of virtue, good behavior, that gap is definitely filling."
There aren't always good examples.
"He's copying the inability."
When we consult them on how to approach them, Sumeyya Demir begins the talk by reminding the celebrity that passion syndrome is more experienced in adolescence.
The problem is more comfortable, given the fact that adolescents can be insecure.
On the one hand, while complaining about the limitations of their families, on the other hand, we face young people who expect support and compassion: "We are obliged to consider their emotional ups and downs."
New research reveals that they were forced by changes in their brains.
"It is also natural for a young man who rides on an emotional roller coaster to be passionately bound, to be treated gently."
It's possible to change behavior.
Specialist psychologist Sumeyya Demir reminds the parent of the duties to overcome celebrity worship syndrome:
Recognise his emotional distress, make sure that you are calm before entering the matter.
Never let him suppress his feelings.
To encourage independence, show respect for his admiration.
Instead of teaching by scolding, set a good example, discuss names that will become role models for him.
Try to discuss the role of celebrities in our everyday lives together.
Reading books about the real world of celebrities together will help.
Make sure you turn your communication into an adult form.
Remember, addiction and motivation use the same methods in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are opportunities for change, accept it as it is.
Make sure you get expert support on fanfare.
The one who's angry and the one who's envious
He needs help and help from someone else at the root of celebrity worship syndrome.
Unblockable love is actually a cry for help.
Unfortunately, that's not how it's perceived.
Moreover, this problem is so common that it is impossible to limit it to a country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyaoglu notes that there are certain names in every country that occupy television.
The syndrome is more about commitment to these celebrities: "They're extraordinary."
The general majority does not have their means.
Those who have it don't live like them.
Either they don't embrace it or they don't dare.
"But those who have no means and those who have no means to live as they do, continue to follow."
There's no difference between those who envy or those who are watching with a fit of rage.
They both have deep admiration.
They make easy money, they're on the magazine's agenda.
That's enough to raise the fan.
Another advice from expert psychologist Sumeyya Demir is to question the reality of those lives at this point.
It must not be overlooked that artificial lives are at stake.
That's where the support of the environment comes in, the person who's passionate about the celebrity.
However, one insists on admitting that the celebrity he is a fan has problems like himself.

Should I have gallbladder surgery?
Dr. Fevzi Özönöl answers questions in his column in Square Newspaper.
I have a rock in my gallbladder, and every morning when I wake up, after meals, I go to the bathroom two or more times a day with a stomachache.
Could that keep me from losing weight?
I'm using alkaline right now, but I'm not losing any weight.
He's been like this since I was a kid.
What should I do?
Do you think I should have gallbladder surgery?
ANSWER: The gallbladder stone is often accompanied by an infection.
These abdominal pain complaints that develop right after the meal are a sign that when you eat, you contract the gallbladder and drain the infected gall into the intestines.
Intestinals that are disturbed by inflammatory bile quickly attempt to expel this gall.
That's why you go to the bathroom so often.
And because you go to the bathroom a lot, your food gets thrown out before it's digested, and your weight loss is slow.
I think you need to get this treated.
If you go to a gastro-enterologist, and the situation I said is detected, you can use antibiotics to get out of this situation.
But sooner or later, you may have to have gallbladder surgery.
Alkalene probiotics can reduce your complaints a little, but they won't.
Whatever happens, I suggest you keep using alkalene probiotics.
Because this is the probiotic powder that helps you weaken.
I eat a lot when I'm stressed.
Teacher, when I'm stressed and nervous, I eat and gain weight.
How am I supposed to deal with this?
ANSWER: A craving for excessive food actually means that the need for energy is not fully met.
This may be because they are undereat or because they are skipping morning and lunch.
Another reason is that you can't digest the food you eat.
To do that, your digestive system needs to work healthy.
If you don't have an ulcer or a reflux or something like that, the easiest way is to use a good probiotic drug.
You'll see it's good for you.
I can't gain weight. The doctors don't know why.
There's usually information in your corner about weakening.
It all makes perfect sense to me, but my situation is a little different.
I can't get any weight.
And most importantly, I don't know why.
The doctors don't say anything.
ANSWER: The techniques we practice are not only to weaken, but to restore the physiological work of the body to its ideal measurements.
Fatness and weakness are the same kind of disorders.
Not losing weight in fat and not gaining weight in weakness is treated by the same technique.
You get weaker when you eat sweet and pastry foods.
I think you've figured that out by now.
You can also be stimulated by carboxypuncture and gain weight by eating healthy food.
So you've gone away from your ideal body by weakening.
Our other patients got fat away from their ideal bodies.
You'll gain weight and reach your ideal body, and they'll lose weight.
If the system goes away, you gain weight, they lose weight.
But first, the system has to work properly.

The boy who feels worthless gets stuck in 'hate'
There are certain feelings that are born in the human world of emotion.
Fear, sadness, happiness, surprise, anger, anxiety...
But feelings such as hatred, hatred, revenge come along in children over time and some misbehaviour.
Every person needs to be an individual, including his childhood.
So if the parent or his social circle respect their decisions, ask for his opinion on matters that concern him, and make him feel valuable.
The provision of these constitutes the basis of a healthy personality structure.
For example, actions such as deciding what to wear, what to eat, what to ignore the child’s wishes, and what to insist on his own truths instead (to be sent to an instrument course) mean not respecting the child’s personality.
Since the child, who is not respected for his self and existence, has lost the freedom to be 'self', the defense mechanism reveals a sense of anger and hatred to protect him.
"Because, in fact, anger and hate are the opposite of acceptance," said psychologist Hilal Arslan, saying that the boy hated what had been done to him, trying to tell both himself and his surroundings that he was valuable.
The boy's refusal to accept the situation and react this way is a positive development in terms of his personality development, the expert psychologist said, "The hatred here means 'I'm in', serving the purpose of keeping the boy's respect for himself."
He says, "If the child is allowed to be an individual, hate will be removed."
The child seeks to protect his own self by taking refuge in anger and hatred
At an early age, at times both physically and spiritually most vulnerable, children’s parents say that exposure to verbal and emotional violence by their surroundings can cause negative feelings in the child, but with neglect, Arslan says, it will make the child feel invisible, invisible.
"It can sometimes be that its needs are not only met in an emotional sense (to caress your hair, to hug and kiss, to care for your school or other needs), and sometimes not to provide for your physical needs (such as food, drinking, housing, school needs, etc."
This is a growing attitude that leads to hate.
In emotional and verbal violence, there are acts such as insults, insults, contempt, rebukes, unnecessary and severe punishments, feelings of worthlessness, shouting.
Since these actions are directed toward the child’s personality, they touch a deep place.
"The child either loses self-respect by accepting them, and spends his life struggling with the feeling that he is worthless, unworthy of love, and inadequate, or trying to protect his own self by resorting to anger and hatred."

Addressing the situation of President Fikret Forest and its staff, 1990-born Brazilian stoper Douglas Silva Bacelar, the 64-year-old trainer noted that his student Stuttgart of Bundesliga was also interested.
Meanwhile, details of the official offer from River Plate were revealed to Argentinean player Jose Sosa of the Black-Whites.

"The path of judgment is now over."
Regulars can apply, too.
The Board of Inquiry had to decide in three months.
According to the Board of Inquiry Working Directive, the rational decision had to be announced in three months.
