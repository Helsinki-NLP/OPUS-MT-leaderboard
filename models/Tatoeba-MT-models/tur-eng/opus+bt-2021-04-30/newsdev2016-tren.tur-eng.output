Norway's akfisk: Is this the world's most scented fish?
Five million people in Norway enjoy the highest standards of living, not just in Europe, but in the world.
Could the secret to the country's success be linked to the local appetite for some over-smelling fish?
Pick up an expired cheese pick.
Place them in the middle of a dirty, wet football jersey.
Leave it for a week.
Now you have one of the great Norwegian flavors that will numb your nose, the smell of rakfisk.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, great view – and that smell, it's always hanging in the air.
Rakfisk is fermented trout for up to a year, depending on how much you like salted and fragrant fish in the water.
When it gets dark and cold, Norwegians gather here for a festival dedicated to this most fascinating dish.
"You eat this raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter and so-called "Rakfisk General".
People around us eat little fish cubes and make plenty of booze.
"Some people love aquavit more than arakfisk," says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'm trying out a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing under your nose, it's not bad – it's no different than a sushi slice after a slightly long bus ride.
Rakfisk is a very different product of the famine times before Norway's refrigerator, when fish are kept waiting in water and salt in airproof water barrels in the fall.
Then, deep in the winter, when fermented, it is taken out and eaten — no doubt by alcohol - devastated senses.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their countries in search of work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Now the population is expanding rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants drawn by work abundance, high salaries and a comprehensive care system.
People from Sweden, who are former competitors and very recently much richer than Norway, are flowing for work.
Rakfisk represents something important, a vital part of Norway's past, even though it smells a little bit.
It's one of the most expensive foods you can buy.
However, everything is expensive – you pay £9 ($14) per small glass of beer or sandwich.
Norway often doesn't come to the global news agenda – and that's how most people like it.
The people here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who killed 77 men, women and children with guns last year.
Instead, the killing is called the July 22 incident.
Norwegians find it hard to believe that one of their own could commit such cruelty and murder in peaceful countries.
Under Norway's present wealth lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we're so good," says our waitress Anna Nordik, as our waitress Anna Nordik, with her long blond hair and creepy blue eyes, distributes her timely rakfisk trays.
We are, how do you say, a humble people.
His English, like most people here, is perfect.
We're not too flashy, we don't like to show off.
Norway has managed oil wealth very carefully – all but a small percentage of money from the industry are being invested in a private fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone else was throwing out the money they didn't have, in the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway was firmly tied to the ropes of its purse.
"We're happy as long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer," says Anna.
"And as the akfisk eats," he adds with a comfortable laugh.
I stand in the snow and wait in line for something to eat – I've had enough rakfisk.
Now an elk burger is definitely something different, and it tastes better.
But there's more smelly fish in the evening.
One of the few venues I'm staying at is the hotel akfisk dinner, where guests vote for the best – and perhaps the most challenging – fish.
There's a live television link on a bow tie server surrounded by Rakfisk plates.
It's like a Eurovision singing contest.
"How many points do you have there for the best fish in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here are our pins, Havard."
There's applause, there's laughter.
A man falls out of his chair, maybe under the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the smell of all these fish.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto faces a rough start
Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, is preparing to move to the office, while BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his people.
Right now, Mexico's traffic is particularly bad.
While a cramped city at the best times, it has emerged to a steel ring that has cut various main routes in the capital since Monday, causing chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will take over the presidential generation and take over as head of the nation.
He's facing a difficult task.
Under the ongoing Felipe Calderon, Mexico had a good economic performance, but the country was in control of a drug war that led to an estimated 60,000 deaths over six years.
Mr. Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office this week, "My government has a big commitment to the people of Mexico to reduce violence."
I will present a new security strategy that will help us achieve this goal.
Prior to shouldering it with the president of the United States, Mr. Pena Nieto's previous political experience was as governor in his own state of Mexico.
The crowd surrounding the capital, in this growing state, is divided into views of the new leader in his former location.
He's an honest man.
For example, he is fondly remembered in the rural town of Valle del Bravo.
Residents here credit him for reviving tourism at the resort and creating infrastructure.
To reach the town, you can go through Mr. Pena Nieto's new highways, a major improvement through the altered cracks and bumps.
Also named plaques hang outside the modern sports center and the impressive interactive climate change museum.
"We are looking at him to bring about real and permanent change," says Mr. Pena Nieto's friend and political ally, state congressman Gabriel Olvera Hernandez of the PRI party.
Especially in terms of security and economics, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs very much.
After 81 years of continuous power, PRI was overthrown by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, there is much expectation of Enrique Pena Nieto at the party.
And he refuses to dismiss the opposition's new president as lacking in essence.
An outspoken man, dedicated by his vision of a great country.
He's a great statesman, and above all he knows how to listen.
But that's not the idea that many people on the other side of the state have of their former governors.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, contrast could not be sharper with the parke-stoned streets of Valle del Bravo.
Under highway overpasses is a suburb of Mexico City in many respects.
And the problems in the municipality are difficult and urban.
This year, the military was called up to help fight drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly severe.
The body of dozens of women killed in the last two years alone was dumped on an empty piece of land near a large waste burial site.
Over 1,000 women were killed in the Mexican state during the time that Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, much more than the city of Ciudad Juarez, known for the murders of violently famous innocent women.
Mr. Pena Nieto's critics say that even when he's on duty at best, he hasn't been able to get close enough to the problem of female murder.
At worst, they accuse him of ignoring his administration.
In a typical concrete house in the Köhne neighborhood, Irinea Buendia tries to fight her tears as she shows me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, his family believes he was killed by his partner.
"When I got to his house, his body looked like it was washed," he remembers, Senora Buendia.
There were traces of him being beaten, and the rigor mortis had already begun.
As her mother recounts the story, a picture of Mariana looks down from the wall, next to a pilgrimage with one word on it: Justice.
But that's exactly what this family says is denied.
State officials treated me like an old gossip, troublemaker, nag.
What they want is for people to simply accept what they're saying and shut up.
"But with so many disorders and shortcomings, that can't be true," he says.
President Pena Nieto comes with heavy responsibilities on Saturday as he buys the sash.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and have pledged to give them priority during the new presidential post.
PRI congressman Olvera says in Valle del Bravo, "I hope the governor is a president as he is."
But this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
The prosecutors claim Bradley Manning didn't complain about misbehavior.
Prosecutors are trying to counter Bradley Manning's abuse allegations.
The trial focuses on Manning's time in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case closed on the grounds that Manning's imprisonment was harsh.
Privates in the army are accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
Prosecutors tried to state on Friday that Private Bradley Manning in the military, charged with the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, had missed an opportunity to file multiple complaints about allegations of misbehavior during military detention.
While Ft. Meade cross-examined prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein Manning at the pretrial hearing in Maryland, he revealed that as long as he was in custody for nine months in Quantico, Virginia, he did not show any complaints about the mistreatment of his weekly visits with unit officers.
The cross-examination in the defense movement for the end of Manning's case on the grounds that his imprisonment was harsh and he was fined enough came a day after he expressed his thoughts on suicide while Manning was in custody.
The military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was later released online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein examined forms filled out by officers after a meeting with Manning while he was in custody in Quantico military prison where he was held with an increased prison sentence from June 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning reported that the behavior made by his guards was "excellent" and that the behavior at the entire facility was "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of mistreatment, although officers ask Manning questions about direct conduct, Fein claims.
Manning responded that he expressed his verbal concern about the issues and that visiting officers spoke about their concerns and would turn to them, but they did not record the issues.
Manning said that "'it's okay' they wrote (after talking about their concerns) and that doesn't mean he didn't say anything."
Judge Lt. Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why she did not complain to the board about her behavior, which examined her suicidal thoughts which she had expressed months earlier during the January 2011 meeting.
Manning responded by saying that his intention at the meeting was to "prevent the wound" situation.
The military said they put him in a restricted situation one step below suicide watch to protect him and others.
"I wanted something to know that I was okay, and I wanted to get out of the POI situation ... to enjoy an improved quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq on Thursday and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for about two months before being transferred to the military prison at Marine Base Quantico in Virginia in June 2010.
He said he was thinking about suicide in Kuwait and that he passed out there once because of the heat.
He said it was stressful not to let him know what had happened to him and what had happened in the outside world.
"My world shrunk to that cage, Camp Purgatory" Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning said that when he got to Quantico, he spent most of his days alone in a small cell for at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours.
Manning said only one bed, blanket, flip-flops, some clothes, and glasses.
He said he was trying to move because it was against the rules to sleep and even lie down during the day.
Manning always said he slept with the light in his eye from outside his cell.
When he got back at night, the guards said they woke him up and brought him back if he couldn't see his face.
Manning's lawyer formally objected to the conduct of Manning in January 2011.
Manning moved to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
At the same time, a claim he made to Judge Manning in his testimony on Thursday asked questions about being forced to sleep naked one night in his cell at Quantico, being forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning census.
Manning testified during the count that he was not given the chance to cover himself with a blanket.
In the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he had to throw a blanket at the guard's order that could wrap him, but no one ordered him to.
Manning testified on Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before due to his attempt to show the officer that there was no danger to him.
Manning told the officer that his underwear could hurt himself using waist tires or flip-flops, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were taken from his cell that night.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his experiences in prison and greatly reduce his sentence if he is convicted in a military court, which is expected to take place at the beginning of next year.
The defense said they planned that Manning would plead guilty to lesser crimes and fight crimes that were too extreme.
The trial was scheduled to continue at the end of this week, with prosecutors expected to discuss the fact that the detention situation was guaranteed.
Pentagon stated Manning was being held in accordance with the rules regarding all maximum detainees in Quantico.
Those involved in assumptions against Manning, helping the enemy, causing intelligence to be misrepresented online, transmitting national defense information, and theft of public property or records.
If convicted of all assumptions, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican American identity crisis
He says a lot of people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity here.
Mexicans tend to condemn those who leave; they remind Mexicans of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a close trip to Mexico City, I barely made it through the crowd to the immigration processing area, and I was stunned.
The signs showed two rows: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners")
I stood there for a few seconds, not sure where to go.
I've been called "Mexican" all my life because I grew up in central California.
In this ethnic shorthand, my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian."
Then I decided on the Mexican American.
But that was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's hometown, there was no need for shorthand or hyphenation.
I was simply American.
I speak Spanish, I'm good enough to direct both sides of a conversation in this language.
But I don't have the native words and I can't get rid of my American accent.
That's why I got my U.S. passport and lined up for Extranjeros.
I thought about it this week when Enrique Pena Nieto, the elected president of Mexico, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
As always, when the leaders of the two countries meet on the agenda: migration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth in the Mexican economy, the reason his Mexicans were likely to remain in Mexico as well as now trying to enter the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
Pena Nieto has vowed to continue Mexico's war on drug cartels, although he does not suggest anything specific.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complex and negative.
Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced their leaders to give up half their land at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans who think for centuries, not minutes, reminders are everywhere.
So the minute a U.S. official says something a little critical about Mexico, you start to hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the elite that Americans are raping their neighbor's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's children go to war.
And yet, the really challenging relationship for Mexico is with over 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about negative feelings?
There's plenty.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people that the country created opportunities and people it didn't create.
The only reason a lot of people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree, maybe a parent or a grandparent has to stay out of opportunity in Mexico and go north.
And often this person fits a profile – dark skin, little education, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
It's not Mexico.
And even though we're not living the American Dream now, we can never miss the fact that it's not Mexico, it's the American Dream that we've been to good schools and found good work.
Our identity may sometimes be vague, but our loyalty is clear.
To the United States.
Besides, we know most of the elite Mexicans in the executive class don't like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat, and they look up at us as if we were a subgroup not enough Mexicans.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico are never strong enough.
Our existence is all about failure in their eyes.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain, well-living souls in the United States, but still lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, came to the United States legally when she was a child, reminding me that there was a dispute between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because the Mexicans held harder on who they were and because Mexican Americans resented it.
Despite being a U.S. citizen, he considers himself part of the two countries.
At the same time, most Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of either.
We love listening to both the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both worlds, but you're not rooted in any of them.
We're considered Americans in Mexico.
We're considered Mexicans in the United States.
Now, as I learned on my journey to complicate the relationship further, some Mexican leaders and some of the intellectuals want to reconnect with Diaspora.
To show their interest in the United States, Mexican Americans want to work as temporary Mexican ambassadors.
We tell Americans like us what a beautiful country it is to visit and force political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much negative emotion.
And with income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, most of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I'm afraid you guys are on your own.
That's fair.
At least if some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for its behavior to Mexico a century and a half ago, then some Mexican Americans still have to admit that they hold a grudge for behavior to family members much sooner than that.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old wars, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas can be a non-probable basis for peace.
Is there ever a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood spill suggests such a hope was in vain.
Among the usual inconclusive debates about who started it, numerous buildings turned to rubble, killing more than 140 Palestinians and six Israelis, most of them civilians, and for the first time missiles from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's great city, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, while the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab spring lifted the pieces into the air, and like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis were caught in regional turmoil.
Maybe it'll make their struggle more bloody than it used to be.
However, there are reasons to think that this could disrupt their deadly stalemate.
No winning, no losing war
At first glance, it seems very difficult to justify optimism now.
Although the ceasefire adopted on 21 November continued, this week's war strengthened hawks on both sides.
The Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 will claim that Hamas leaders have forced Israelis to retreat, although Gaza has been defeated.
Although they killed some of their leaders and kept 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the world's worst and most populous corners, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Of course, Hamas, the other part of Palestine, currently led by its major rivals in Fatah, is winning the more central Palestinian fight in the West Bank.
Furthermore, Hamas' leaders may also conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas made powerful and wealthy friends.
The regional force, Israel's once closest Muslim ally, has taken the aim of Turkey Hamas, and so has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamics in the Gulf states.
The joyful Hamas people say that the growing Islamist slope from Lebanon, led by the Hezbollah military party around Israel, curved towards Syria, where it could overthrow Bashar Assad, and landed in Jordan, where Hamas' allies threatened the king.
Above all, the rise of the Muslim Brothers under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, which was by far the most populous and important among the Arab countries in the southern wing of Israel, changed the balance of the region.
By his fall in 2011, the secular tyrant Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years, had little time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is Hamas' cousin and their leader are becoming more of a public issue.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as an actor who cannot be prevented even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel's conservatives will have adverse results.
Militaryly, he was put back in the Hamas box.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system proved its value and most of Hamas' missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep better for a while.
Diplomaticly, America is more determined than ever, and most European countries have blamed Hamas for starting recent violence.
Above all, Israel grew up under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has barely survived suicide bombers due to the barrier that landed in the West Bank, the main part of the desired Palestinian state, which continues to expand despite its violations of international law.
Mr Netanyahu, who merged with Avigdor Lieberman's even more pro-war group as the Likud party heads for the election on 22 January, is at ease.
Why should these lying Palestinians be spoiled by giving their own state?
If they really run the West Bank, won't they fire rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them when they raise their heads.
Maybe the conservatives win, but the Arab spring can still change their accounts.
Although Islamists gain power in Egypt and other places love Israel very little, their priority is to struggle with difficulties in their homes.
Israel's defence budget is larger than the combination of Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpowers doesn't help the new Arab governments much to improve their economy.
Pragmatic Mr. Mursi worked with Barack Obama to provide a good-looking truce, and perhaps they can make the beginning of something.
The Israelis must look forward to the long term.
While the rest of the Arab world is more democratic, depriving Palestinians of autonomy rights constitutes a powder keg that is inevitable to explode in Israeli-occupied territories one day this week, like a bus exploding in Tel Aviv.
Pressure in the Jewish state is already undermining democracy and the demographic flares up as the Arab population grows.
In every few years, bloody missions against Gaza to overthrow Hamas will reach a growing diplomatic cost.
It needs external incentives on both sides.
The answer remains declared by most outside worlds from both sides and reasonable people who are this newspaper: the two states in which Israel represents the region for security.
A small hope in the short term is that the ceasefire will give a little more pressure to foreigners who force this goal.
With Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, which now must begin to stop the flow of arms to Gaza, is in a better place to convince Hamas to accept the idea of the Jewish state based on the borders in 1967 with land exchange and common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs must force Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would be more useful in creating a Palestinian state than the upcoming offer of virtual government in the UN.
Mr. Obama plays a role in bringing Israel to the table.
In the first period, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
He seems reluctant to be brought in at the White House.
This is painfully blinding.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians.
Cigarette-free packing laws are enacted in Australia
Cigarette warnings and diseased organs are placed in plain green boxes for all tobacco brands
Australia's first laws on smoking and tobacco came into effect, replacing brand logos and colors with depictions of children and babies who are ill because of the general olive green coating, creepy pictures of diseased organs, and their parents smoking.
Except for various health warnings and images, the only difference between packages is that brand names, which will be mandatory from Saturday, are printed with the same small font.
It's the strictest regime in the world for packing tobacco.
Australia's federal government says the goal is to get young people out of the habit of being attracted to smoking.
This is based on research that shows that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26, 99% of the time, they will never start.
"From a very young age, you can see that children understand that tobacco companies are trying to sell through brands," said the federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that show that children relate the crown logo to the idea of becoming princesses, for example.
Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, and although changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries consider similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the law.
Tobacco companies said they would support the black market trade and lead to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia said, "The Legislature will have serious undesirable consequences."
Forgers from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say the law has increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, nearly jumped up from zero two months ago when your silicon sheaths to mask unpleasant packages, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco in England, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the challenge to laws in the Australian supreme court.
He says Zico has made more than 6,000 sales at wholesale locations and is expecting new stock.
It's a good job for us.
Experts say the potential disruption is the popularity of social media in the demographic targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banned television commercials and sports sponsorship and asked most vendors to hide cigarettes from visible locations, the tobacco market moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising from local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas sites.
Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney, said, "If you are in the tobacco market and there is only this small window left to promote your products, the place you must attend is online."
Freeman said the brands had an increase in "average human" reviews on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
What we need to ask is, is it a civilian who really likes Marlboro cigarettes and bothered to make a video, or is a marketing company in there?
British American Tobacco said the Australian industry is focused on dealing with new rules rather than marketing.
The industry has advanced to paying Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules, which claim that trade has been unfairly restricted, although none of the countries in the World Trade Organization have significantly traded with Australia.
A WTO decision is likely to come out in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government is negotiating with other countries considering similar packaging decisions.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to impose photo warnings.
Now these have spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More strict laws are being considered in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Most smokers in Australia are challenging.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm ignoring them.
"Take a cigarette and put it back," Victor El Hage said while buying a package with a picture of a mouth tumor.
To be honest, there's only one reason I should quit, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who runs the King of Packages tobacco shop in central Sydney, said single-type packing made it difficult to stock shelves.
Yu said, "It used to take me an hour to unload a delivery, now it takes me four hours."
"The government should have banned it from the whole, then OK, well, we'd say we're done, we'd close the shop," he said, raising his hands.
Being Bored in a World That's Always Plugged Up Is Not Too Bad
On this Thanksgiving break, when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane, I spent five unexpected hours at the airport.
So I had a lot of time to think about being bored.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting for a plane for half a day at the airport is quite tedious, although distractions such as books, magazines, and iPhones (not to mention unsung shopping).
But increasingly, some academics and child development experts praise boredom.
They say it's okay for us and our kids to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go to interesting tangents and perhaps enhances creativity.
And most of us don't experience the benefits of being bored because we're plugged in from one screen to another.
So we should embrace boredom?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First of all, I assumed that being bored with more free time like most people coming out was a relatively new concept.
Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University in Canada, and author of "Bore: A Live History" (Yale University Press, 2011), says he is not.
"The boredom actually has a very long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii is a first-century Latin graffiti about boredom.
Then comes the question of how to define boredom.
The problem is that this has been described and discussed in many different ways, says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and putting the idea ahead of a focus group of about 100, Professor Eastwood and colleagues described boredom as being "unintentional but unsatisfactory with the event".
He said the thing that separates boredom from sluggishness is that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
He said there's no urge to do anything about it.
The core experience of boredom is "the disruption of the process of interest with low mode and the feeling of slow passage of time", he said.
Boredom can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that people who are bored tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, but people in depression see the problem as themselves.
Sometimes we think we're just bored when we're having trouble concentrating.
Professor Eastwood and colleagues pointed to an old experiment published in September in the journal Viewing Psychological Sciences, where participants listened to the recording of a person reading a magazine article in their work "Unbusyed Mind: Definition of Boredom from the Interest".
Some bands heard a loud and unrelated television show in the next room, others heard it very little noticeable at a very low level, but the third group never heard the sound.
Those who heard low-level television reported more boredom than the other two groups, having difficulty concentrating, but were unsure why, and associated this difficulty with boredom.
Mark J. Fenske, one of the authors of the study and a professor of neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario, said that when you try to focus on a difficult or busy task, the disruption of interest causes distress.
On the other hand, when you read something boring, "like looking at bad vehicles on a factory tape, distraction music can help you not get bored."
In fact, convulsion and defamation, often seen as a sign of distress, can make people more physically sober, making them struggle with it.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to be mobile learn more and learn more from them than children who are forced to stay still," Professor Fenske said.
We all experience adversity at some point, the delay of my flight, a monotonous speaker, a boring film.
But some tend to be more bored than others.
To help measure this, researchers developed a "Strength Trend Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale contains questions like "Most of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "I have a lot of interests, I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, said using such scales, researchers discovered that men tend to be more bored about needing more and various external impulses, especially than girls.
But mostly teenagers are a very lazy group.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment where he communicated seven or eight times a day through a pager with about 400 adolescents and parents.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers were bored at school and doing homework, but 23% were bored when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson now said he didn't know if the bored percentages would be higher or lower in 21 years.
However, he said that he knew that "adolescence is the peak period of boredom", since children and adolescents were not given too much control over what they wanted to do.
So I go back to my first question: is it good for a person to get bored?
Sometimes no, because research shows that as a way of reducing it, it can lead to ridiculous physical risks, gambling, or substance abuse.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who has worked on the issue for more than two decades, said many philosophers and writers have discussed the connection between boredom and creativity.
Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at N.Y.U., said, "Borement is your brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else."
But the brain doesn't always know the right thing to do.
If you're bored and you're using that energy to play guitar and cook, it'll make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it might make you happy in the short term, but not in the long run.
So when your child is bored, if you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he won't learn to entertain himself or organize himself, Professor Fenske said.
And he said, "This transfers from one self-regulation situation to another."
Your child learns not only to amuse himself, but also to control himself more in other areas.
I don't think we really want to be bored.
We shouldn't be too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to be comfortable away from constant chatter about activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood has joined.
"We frame it as we need to be more bored, but boredom is the desire to be connected to something painful, uncomfortable meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for is a way to get off the hook and enjoy the free time, he said.
"It is difficult to find ways to be busy when sound is off in an environment where we are constantly overly warned," he said.
No Screenplay for New Marijuana Law in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, 19, a district college student and football player in southeastern Colorado faces charges for something that will soon be legal in the state: carrying several pieces of marijuana and pipe to drink it.
Mr Orozco said that one day in September he and his friends were stopped driving in the plains near the Kansas border in Lamar.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a call for minor offences, transport and drugs device, each with a fine of $100, and was given a court date.
"We have been treated like criminals," said Mr Orozco.
But is he like that?
In the uncertain weeks of Colorado's vote to legalize a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of small drug cases depends more on the location than the law.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases are already being closed here and in the state of Washington, which approves a similar measure.
Police units have stopped charging adults aged 21 and over for small-scale transport that will be legally approved when the laws take effect in the coming weeks.
However, prosecutors in more conservative areas in Colorado have vowed to continue their current marijuana cases decisively and are still calling people to court for transport.
At the same time, several towns from the Denver suburbs to the Western Mountains vote to prevent the opening of new state-licensed retail marijuana shops in their areas.
"This thing is growing so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief of Aurora east of Denver.
And the regulators in Washington State are scratching their heads.
And they're looking for guidance on how to build a licensing system for production, manufacturing, distribution and sales, which date back to December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado's first medical use is now ahead of most states in terms of marijuana regulation in recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regular market, so they will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Drinking Control Board.
But no place or system can do more than suggest what works, Mr. Smith.
"There is no real example for us to follow," he said.
Washington's law, called I-502, will take effect on 6 December, leaving a year of uncertainty in which the state licensing system does not yet exist but legal transport will occur.
There are tough mechanical questions that need to be solved during this time, like how the state can offset its "sufficient access" directive to marijuana licensed by its restrictions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, children's parks, or children's care centers.
Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly formed research group Legal Hemp Center, said, "It can't be harder to have a licensed hemp business anywhere than city areas, especially the Seattle big city district."
On 21 November, Chief Oates in Aurora sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that "it is about to come into effect immediately" that the city attorney would not sue minor marijuana violations for anyone aged 21 and above, and that police would stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would introduce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and they would follow drug traffickers and dealers again.
In the Weld region of northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a more rigid view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to monitor marijuana transport cases, mostly as a way to force users into treatment.
Currently, 119 people are accused of carrying two ounces or less marijuana, while many face other charges.
Mr. Buck said in a statement, "Our office has a duty to sue crimes that are criminal during their time."
Even in such places as the rural Mesa District, where the voters rejected the marijuana initiative, the response became complicated.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the region, no longer sue adults for small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to close pending transport cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time following the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it would never be easy to bring recreational marijuana into the government and legal system.
And the controversial reactions that are common in the state raise a profound dilemma among local authorities about the great green experiment of the state.
The Denver lawyer representing marijuana advocates and local spokesman for the Marijuana Laws Reform National Organization Sean McAllister says this is a "cultural barrier" with district attorneys.
"They've spent so much of their lives suing people, so they still don't admit it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are ready to become national test cases on legalizing drugs.
Lawyers and state officials are planning a new frontier for legal sales while also anxiously awaiting direction from the federal government, which plans to approach the sale and production of marijuana as a federal crime.
Legalized marijuana lawyers hope the Justice Department will withdraw.
Despite high-profile arrests by medical marijuana patients and dealers, the federal government has often allowed medical marijuana businesses in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Former drug policy consultant Kevin A. Sabet under Obama said drug agents would probably not punch doors to catch a small drug bag, but it is likely that they would stop them from allowing recreational marijuana shops organised by the state, which are permitted by new laws.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to take action.
Even before Election Day, some local governments agreed to debt delays by new marijuana shops, which were about another year before they could open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose imposed a six-month ban and is likely to be adopted next week.
"We don't want to give someone a license and be put in a position where this is a major federal problem," City Council member Bob Nicholson said.
Our territory voted against the change.
We're looking at a vote against the state's vote.
That's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was removed from Oxford because I was conservative.
Just today's students aren't being attacked by their opinions.
I can't remember a time when I didn't dream of winning a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been found in my dream in the modern wine red Greek symposium, the world's best teaching place, where two pillars of civilization were encouraged by freedom of thought and tolerance.
But in the late '80s, when I took my place at Worcester College to study history, I packed my bags, started the first scandal of my life.
My father was devastated and cried.
Friends are baffled.
The Evening Standard agenda claimed that I left because I objected to my undergraduate friends having sex in the room next to me.
Writer A N Wilson announced that I had left because I was humorously forced to drink from a broken cup.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was faced with systematic teasing and intimidation.
It's not because of my name or because I came from private school.
I was only tried for one reason, and in the cradle of this so-called enlightenment this was both backward and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was Margaret Thatcher's high-profile advisor, and I was supporting the Conservatives.
You might want to ask me why I brought this up.
Recent reports indicate that the next generation of right-based students draw from similar trials.
At Oxford, he institutionalized and increased hatred of conservative students so much that last week they demanded the same equal rights as a group of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's third-class common room (JCR) claimed that because of their political views, they were "frequently left alone, personally attacked and felt what they were not wanted".
They want to create a publication on the university's equal opportunity committee so that their views can be published freely.
The new BBC Two documentary Wonderland also did not help the situation: It made the Young, Bright, and Conservatives on Student politics seem strange and neo-Nazi on the Right.
The Association of Conservatives (OUCA) of Oxford University saw the alumnus Joe Cooke walking around in a silver suit and silver-headed cane with Rolls-Royce.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "sacrifices" for their rising tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, Vice President of the University of Nottingham Conservatives Association told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a left wing discrimination growing in universities."
"Before we meet, people think we're like the Bullingdon Club."
In Corpus Christi, who proposed the move for better protection, history student Samuel Roberts, 21, says such an environment is "uncomfortable", but Stephanie Cherill, 19, the elected president of OUCA, says that there is a disruption in the attitudes of JCR members toward right-based people.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate and the presence of members," he says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a one-man minority.
In September 1986, at the age of 18, I went as a disturbingly shy person.
Hatred against the Conservative Party was at its hottest time.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny the honor rating of its former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in higher education payments.
This atmosphere made a pro-Stalin tremble with fear.
On the first few days of the first week, while the students socialized with each other and with the teachers, I tasted the pain that would come.
I would see the teachers enjoying the ridicule of conservative students, as well as ignoring them.
Opposition politics to sanctions against the mining strike, privatization and the government's secession South Africa had been brought to the wooden panelled rooms of education.
The first was about me translating 18th-century French texts into English, and I was unprepared for what came next.
"Mrs. Wyatt, please translate the first paragraph," said lecturer Harry Pitt (died).
I stumbled on it.
Pitt, a little man with a face like cake dough, had a lot of setbacks.
He asked, "Do the Thatchers refuse to learn French or are they just idiots?"
Other undergraduate students giggled.
The tears hurt the back of my eyes.
"If you're not too busy socializing in your spare time, I suggest you take basic French lessons," said Pitt.
I walked back to my room with a painful face.
That evening, I sat alone at a college dinner, and then I felt a slight touch on my shoulder.
This was a sophomore English student named James, who identified himself as an OUCA member.
"I know who you are," he politely said.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being conservative is being dealt with.
This is bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most conservative freshmans pretend to be pro-employees.
Then, at a local bar, I tried to fake it like a coward.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
This tactic proved its failure.
"You are the daughter of a fascist pig," said a first-class PPE student who was ironically present in Eton.
You're dirty.
The other students held back.
I was a pervert. I was dirty.
Someone asked, "How do conservatives have sex?"
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt like gay people would have felt it before the liberal life of the '60s.
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Was I forced to meet people who agreed only when it was dark?
Go back to the working party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years ahead of me lie like a purgatory of exile and loneliness.
Norman Stone was the only openly conservative Professor of Modern History at my university.
He was hated for being both conservative and one of Thatcher's foreign policy advisers and textwriters.
He was barely there.
He was disgusted with it because it was small and provincial and because of its commitment to the Marxist need-to-know view of history.
In 1997 he began professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
He said, "You won't be happy there."
I started going back and forth from Oxford to my parents' house in London, taking refuge in my more open-minded big-city friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
In the 40s, all political views were accepted in his time.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said in a pathetic way.
They don't do that, not in my dream towers.
Even my communist friends always had excellent manners.
His moist eyes began to cloud.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure this is all a joke.
If you leave, it'll break my heart.
My emotional resilience, tired of frequent visits to London, was weakening.
A conservative boyfriend of mine submitted to pressure and rejected his faith.
The next week, during an education, another history lecturer said that I was a total and total public enemy, so I decided to do the same thing.
I confessed to being "brained by my parents", shy of shame, and I called them "old fools."
The breathing was short.
My father nailed the coffin of my Oxford career.
Then, every week, Murdoch was writing two columns on his broadcast.
My door was locked.
I snuck in, and five minutes later, the guys who were after me gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
Call me a whining wimp.
However, no 18-year-old should be subjected to such intimidation and sarcasm in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that Oxford has released both 14 conservative prime ministers and is hiding behind the reputation of equality and freedom of thought which he has not so far deserved.
Flood in Trabzon swallowed two
Two Su creeks overflowed due to torrential rainfall, which was effective in Yomra County, Trabzon.
Two women who were taken by the flood in the village of Taşdelen disappeared, while Sayvan village road closed to transportation.
The body of one of the two women missing in the flood has been recovered.
Precipitation was effective in the high part of Yomra around 3:00 p.m.
When the two creeks moved, about 200 metres of the road connecting the Two Village to Sayvan Village was flooded.
"The road has been closed for 3 hours.
We're experiencing the same thing every time it rains.
We've notified the authorities, but no one's coming or going.
Citizens are miserable.
We go through this every year.
When the trees block the stream, the water is on its way."
TO THE DEATH OF A PERSON
Yomra Mayor Ibrahim Duğıoğlu has reported that one of the two women who disappeared in the flood caused by an effective downpour in the district has been recovered and that the search for the other person is ongoing.
Duğığoğlu reminded that a flood struck due to yesterday’s impact in the district, two women who collected nuts in the village of Taşdelen lost their way into the floodwaters.
"One of our citizens' bodies have been recovered from the ground as a result of the work of the municipal machinery, the search for the other is ongoing," he said, stating that late night search work has been restarted early in the morning.
Noting that the rain had lost its impact, it had been replaced by sunny air, Duğimoğlu added that the search for the missing person and the work on closed roads had been conducted in peace.
As the search for the missing women continued, the road to the village of Taşdelen was reportedly opened.
"The Stone Won't Stay On The Stone"
Citizens in the village of Taşdelen in Yomra district of Trabzon are trying to heal the injuries of the flood and landslide disaster caused by the torrential downpour.
Derya, one of the residents of the village of Taşdelen, stated that the rain lasted for about three hours continuously, saying, "It's not rain. It's not rain. It's like disaster."
"We stopped collecting nuts, which expressed that many people had evacuated their homes against landslide danger during the rain.
Later, such a disaster occurred.
The missing bride and mother-in-law were picking nuts during the rain.
They were then caught in a landslide on their way home."
Taşkara added that electricity was cut off in their villages and their water was not flowing.
Hasan Selim stressed that he had reached 60 years of age and had not seen such rain until this age, saying, "If the rain had continued for another hour, there would have been no stone here."

There's no way there's a match here.
"Now we have a tough Bursaspor away.
Matches aren't easy to win.
We don't see our opponents as a piece of cake, and the Ghaziantepspor match is proof of that."
Who's got a disability? How do you get a month?
I'm going to try to make a contribution to all of you valuable readers of Freedom to the solution of your problems in working life and social security from now on, or to all of the things they're curious about, and to pass on my experience to you.
Our readers, both written and visual, are facing hundreds of stories in the field of social security and working life.
From now on, I will present to you the truest, healthiest, and most reliable news in the newspaper Hurriyet and Hurriyet.com.tr.
First, I'd like to discuss a very public disability case.
We will discuss these articles in episodes, which will continue in the form of a series of articles.
In our article, you can find answers to all questions about disability in its outline.
You can send questions that you do not have the answer to and which concerns you in private from the alipek to@hurriyet.com.tr.
I'll be working hard to respond to you as soon as possible.
What's a disability pension?
MALULEN is the opportunity to retire early, which is recognised by the SSK and Bind-Kurd insurance policy, regardless of the retirement age, provided that they meet the insurance requirements counted in the SGK law, so that the SSK and the Insurers who have lost their workforce by at least 60 per cent but are unable to work.
It is also the case that public employees can be retired in cases where they lose the power to gain in a profession that they cannot do their duty, apart from those mentioned above.
Who's a cripple?
I write from Diyarbakir, my name is Mehmet Gültekin, I have 920 days of insurance and 540 days of military debt and 1460 days of insurance.
Besides, I have kidney disease.
I'm connecting to the dialysis machine.
I still work in a workplace.
Can I get a disability allowance?
- Mr. Mehmet, first of all, feel better.
This is the first time you haven't mentioned when you got a job.
However, let us briefly explain to you how to make a disability allowance.
First of all, the most important of the terms specified in the law is that it has been insured for 10 years and you have to have a total bonus day of 1800 days.
In addition, you are considered a disability when it is determined that you have lost at least 60 percent of your workforce or in the profession as a result of a job accident or occupational illness.
However, since you're here with dialysis, you provide the 60 percent requirement that 1800 premiums can't be connected monthly because you don't fill out the number of days.
Of course, we don't know how many years you've worked.
It will be connected to you monthly if you apply to the SGK on the day you complete 10 years together and the day you complete 1800 days.
Under the circumstances of disability monthly rights
Can't anyone retire without 10 years and 1800 days with a disability month requirement?
- 1800 days of premium payment must be completed.
However, there is only one exception; for those who are determined to be in need of someone else's constant care, the disability monthly is linked by the record of meeting other conditions without a ten-year requirement of insurance.
The subject of what diseases or ailments will be referred to in the next part of our article.
The condition of the disabled before they start working
I'm Ahmet Guler.
They told me that even though I carry all the conditions in the NGO law, you can't get me a disability month because I was sick before I got the job for the first time.
I'm too much of a victim.
It's not fair.
How can I retire?
Mr. Ahmet, you have written that you provide all the conditions in the law, but it is imperative that the disease, which is essential to the loss of work for the SSK and Binkur insurers, which are one of the main conditions, does not exist before entering the job.
The disability month cannot be attached because you do not have this condition.
However, you can retire if you carry pension conditions in the coverage of old age insurance.
- I've got 3980 days and I've been insured for 16 years.
My disability was determined by the SGK before I took the job.
They told me you couldn't retire.
So what am I gonna do?
I won't be able to retire.
Will you show me the way?
- Yeah, you heard right.
You can't retire.
However, the SGK law also has a pension prescription for you.
Well, there are two situations before and after October 2008.
If you first started working before this date, if the SGK determines that you are disabled before you work, you can receive a partial seniority month with an insurance period of at least 15 years and a 3600 premium number of days.
Therefore, we suggest that you apply for a monthly extension by applying for a close call to the SGK Directorate.
- Well, if you'd taken a job after October 2008, then you could've gotten an old age pension, on the condition that you'd been insured for at least fifteen years and at least 3960 days of disability, old age and death insurance premiums had been reported.
Do you have to quit while applying?
I still work as a driver at a job.
When I got to the hospital, I was diagnosed with cancer.
I want to retire.
In that case, do I have to leave work?
Can't I apply for disability for the month before I leave?
I don't want to be out of a job until I'm tied up monthly.
- That's right.
You must quit your job to submit a monthly commitment petition.
However, before you apply for a monthly allowance, you need to be considered maul under the SGK law.
However, if you are disabled, it will be connected to you monthly, along with other conditions.
There's no point in petitioning for a monthly commitment without disability, there's a risk of being unemployed.
That's enough to have 1,800 days.
When you go to the CDC and file a petition to determine my disability, the SGK will refer you to one of the authorized hospitals.
When you bring the health board report you will receive here to the SGK, the SGK will evaluate it on its own Health Board, and if it decides that your cancer affects your workforce loss by over 60 percent, there will be a reason for you to apply for a monthly commitment.
However, if you also need to fill in the ten-year insurance period for your monthly commitment, you will be able to be connected monthly.
So let's just say that it's not rational for employees to apply before the S.E.C. Health Board sees the "you're disabled" decision.
But if insurers who don't work at any job carry all the conditions, they can ask the SGK to determine the disability status and to connect them monthly at the same time.
If this is malfunctional and carries other conditions, it may be useful to him for his monthly start a little earlier.
Would the bond-worm lender retire?
I'm a bond-worm insured.
I'm carrying all the terms.
But they said you can't retire because you owe me money.
What should I do?
- I'm a valuable reader.
Whoever told you told you the truth.
You haven't written down what the other conditions are, but if you think you're carrying these terms, it's a legal obligation to pay your 4/b bonus debt.
But I can give you a special tip.
Since you'll be paid, I suggest you pay your debt by making a vehicle for banks or such.
The sooner it's connected monthly, the more months you'll get, and the sooner you'll pay your debt.
It will be easy for you to be in debt because these organizations have cut you off from your monthly allowance.
What status does the disability month depend on?
I worked as a subject to both the SSK and the Bond-Kurd and the Retired Ark.
When I earn a month's salary, how does it get attached to me monthly?
- My dear reader, if you've worked in multiple statuses as a Bond-Kurd, SSK, and an officer, your disability allowance will be tied up according to your last insurance policy, so if you're most recently insured as an SSK, you'll get a monthly allowance from the SSK if you're on leave and carry other conditions.
Hospital reports that apply to the SGK
How do you apply for disability?
What hospitals can I get a medical report from?
For health board reports, you can only apply for social security or social security centres that you are affiliated with.
The SGK will refer you to the Ministry of Health training and research hospitals, university hospitals (except private university and foundation hospitals), military hospitals affiliated with the Turkish Armed Forces.
However, if these hospitals do not exist in your municipality of residence, a transfer can also be performed to the full-fledged hospitals of the Ministry of Health.
Isn't it possible to transfer to a private hospital?
- It's possible, but there are conditions.
The former arrangement will include the transfer of patients who are in intensive care and vitally risky patients to the hospital where they can also be transferred to the private hospital where patients who have been treated in intensive care and who are at vital risk will be transferred to another hospital, with the new regulations that will now be enacted with the SGK at 01.09.2013.
What are the conditions for the transfer?
It takes 1,800 days of premiums to ensure that a referral can be carried out to determine the disability status of an insured person who has asked for love.
Hospital costs for disability detection will be paid by the SGK.
Besides, there's not going to be a 10-year insurance period.
According to the health board report, it finds that if the disability allowance is tied, the ten-year insurance period, which is amongst the conditions for care-deprived disability, is only enough 1,800 days without seeking insurance.
Therefore, when the first person comes to determine his disability, the SGK is only looking at 1,800 days of disability, in case he may be in need of care.
Nargile operation
He began police inspections for the bans that began to be applied to bongile cafes.
As a result of the weekend's inspections, many businesses had to stop selling bongs.
The police have begun to conduct operations with the notification, which has entered into force at bongile cafes in Istanbul.
The operation that carried out the bongies in the Beşiktaş region and the sale of non-licensed businesses were halted.
While almost all bong cafes are affected by inspections, fines will be fined in the first phase to operators who continue to sell bongs.
Businesses that continue to sell will be sealed off.
THE SAILS HAVE BEEN STOPN
The Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Agency (TAPDK)'s "Responsibility on Hususes That Need to Be Sleeped in Operating These Places" was published in February.
With the announcement, bongile cafes were given five months to move at least 200 meters from the schools.
And no bongs in closed spaces.
The first operation for businesses that did not comply with the notice began from Beşiktaş as of the other day.
Al Faker in Babel, Istanbul's most popular bong venues, also had to stop their sales, especially the Ikram Nargile Cafe in Ihlamur Kasri and Mis Nargile Cafe in Beşiktaş tsar.
The sentences start at 23,000.
The police will issue fines starting at $23,000 if unlicensed venues continue to sell bongs.
The three-time fines will be sealed.
Currently, about five operators in Istanbul have a bong cafe license, allegedly.
Warnings on bottles
TAPDK had made it mandatory for operators to ‘warn’ their bong bottles as of July 27. According to the notification issued, health warnings had been cylindrical or conical based on the shape of the bong bottle.
Warnings are being implemented to begin with in the mouth section of the bottles.
Blue, red, yellow, and black colors can be used for printing health warnings.
Currently, there are warnings at several bong cafes.
Critical warning to families from the police
The Security Directorate warns families of activities organised by illegal organisations under the name "summer camp", "student camp" to gather supporters.
The Anti-Terror Branch teams have unveiled a new plan of organisations, including the DHKP-C, MLKP, TKP, TKIP and some of the legal structures that have been collected in 17 provinces.
Security forces, who have determined that terrorist organizations are holding camps for young people under the name "summer camp" "student camp" to gather fans, have warned families not to send children to these camps.
The terror police, who determined that terrorist organizations were planning to organise 41 camps in different provinces, contacted families and asked them not to send their children to these camps.
350 families have stopped sending their children to camp
In particular, the terror police, who determined that terrorist organisations such as DHKP-C, MLKP and TKIP intended to bring young people into the organisation using legal extensions, warned the families they were meeting against activities organised under the camp's name.
Taking into account the warnings issued by the police, 350 families gave up sending their children to the camps in question.
Following the warnings of police, 14 of the 41 camps that organisations were planning to organise were cancelled.
Terrorist organisations have carried out 20 camps, despite declining participation.
Security forces said 2 camps are still ongoing and 5 camps are scheduled to be held in the coming days.
The Police Department also sent a warning letter to relevant units in all provinces regarding these camps.
Young people are being set up
The 20 camps carried out by terrorist organizations were organized in İzmir, Kocaeli, Balıkesir, Çanakkale, Niğde, Eskişehir, Bursa, Bartın, Artvin, Mersin and Hatay, while the camps of Army, Samsun, Trabzon, Bartin, İzmir, Bolu and Adana were cancelled.
According to police reports, these camps are mostly attended by young people who have just graduated from college.
Illegal organizations entrap young people with their propaganda at the camps, bringing them into the organization.
These camps also promote the commitment of young people to the organisation by providing organizational training to young people who have just joined the organisation.
These camps, under the image of summer camp, are trained on topics such as organizational training, as well as how "actions can be transformed into violence".
The message that came out half a century later
A bottle thrown into the Atlantic Ocean 50 years ago by a boy named Dennis Komsa found the owner in the U.S. state of New Jersey.
The glass bottle came out of the wreckage around a house following Hurricane Sandy, which occurred last year in the United States.
In the bottle, "To the person concerned, please answer the following questions and send them to the address below.
This is a scientific study by Dennis Komsa (12)".
In the article, the person who found the bottle is asked to describe where, when, and how.
The bottle also contains an envelope and a coin to cover the postage fee.
The bottle, dated August 16, 1963, was recently given to its owner, located about 35 kilometres from where it was dumped on the New Jersey coast.
Komsa, 12 years old in 1963, said it was a surprise to see the bottle she threw into the ocean after about half a century, saying, "I had thrown it in the water thinking that someone would find it, but I never thought the bottle would return to me."
♪ Sound makes the frequencies fall in love ♪
One of Turkey's first sound engineers, Süden Pamir, told me what can be done with sound frequencies.
When you say sound technologies or sound engineering, you're pretty sure everybody's thinking about sound systems.
Did you know that sound technologies and terrorism can be prevented, perfect murder by point-of-frequency pulse, you can make anyone fall in love with you, you can get a secret confessed, or you can adapt to the rhythm of the world?
Süden Pamir received an audio engineering degree from SAE college in England after completing the University of Bilkent Department of Internal Architecture and earned a master's degree in audio technology at Middlesex University.
Beyoglu also teaches audio engineers at the Communications Technology Music Academy ITM, which he founded in Galatasaray, and teaches such classes as music technology, sound technology, performance technologies, electronic music and advanced recording techniques.
Subliminal message to terrorism
"What exactly is sound technology?" is my first question.
"A technology that can be used in many fields around the world.
Our brain perceives everything through electrical currents.
The sound frequency is also an electrical current of some kind, energy.
You can use that energy to change people's perception, make them move at any command you want."
One of the most important subdivisions of sound technology is the subliminal message.
Inside the music or song is placed a message sung on a frequency outside the human perception limit, which cannot be defined by the upper memory but goes to the lower memory.
For example, when a terrorist attack is reported, a music broadcast can be broadcast in that area, according to Pamir.
If a message like "Don't do this attack" is placed on the released song with a changed frequency, the terrorist notices this message selectively in perception.
He doesn't understand what he's hearing, but his lower memory perceives it, and inside, it feels like he said, "Don't do it."
He considers it to be a reminder from Allah.
However, in the world and Turkey, such messages are strictly prohibited and punishable from being used outside community security.
Suden Pamir is a subliminal message at a conference at Istanbul Technical University just once, so that she can tell students about it.
"I played a music for the students during the conference.
I put a sound frequency in the music that begged for 'Suu'.
At the end of the presentation, I asked the students if they were thirsty.
Surprisingly, they all said they were very thirsty," he says.
According to Pamir, there are those who use subliminal messages as fugitives, "Some radio stations in our country have been identified as doing so, but details are not yet known.
There's a channel in Germany called 'The Radio of the Black Voice', a frequency of radical Islamists.
Subliminally, it emits overly aggressive, religiously involved, calls for jihad, commands drug use.
The German police and Turkish police both know this, but it cannot be dealt with because they constantly change frequencies," he said.
There are also dangerous messages in the music world.
Especially in the songs of some heavy metal bands...
According to these allegations, there were no terrorists on the planes that entered the towers, the attack was carried out directly by subliminal commands addressing the lower consciousness of the pilots.
Concierge table
Sound technologies can also be used in criminal cases.
In the U.S., it's particularly used in bank robberies.
For example, as soon as the police make phone contact with the robber, audio engineers are able to identify the person from the voice on the phone in the bank, in which room he is.
When a voice hits metal, wood, plastic, wall, or any other substance, its echo is different.
According to the way the sound echoes, it's possible to determine the size of the room it's in, even the shape of the room, how many corners it has.
Thus, it can be determined which items were found in the voice of the offender, the size and shape of which he was in a room.
There was also a computer program used for this, which Pamir even made drawings of an opera building from Tatarstan with which he said, "I calculated that wherever 175 speakers were placed in the building, the perfect sound set could be provided.
It's not expensive technology either, it's worth $45,000," he said.
Sound frequencies are also used in architecture and decoration.
Pamir has a lot of work to do about it.
For example, in a restaurant where businessmen go to high-end tender meetings, he makes a setup where voices can't get out of the meeting table.
Only those on the table can hear what they're saying.
Two steps away, someone else can't hear anything on the table.
The general system of these types of devices is, "If you want to destroy a sound, you collide it with another sound at the same frequency as the opposite of your own molecule structure, and you destroy the existing sound energy and turn it into heat.
Nobody would have gotten on the plane without this system anyway.
Because aircraft engines are too loud to tolerate.
On the plane, these voices destroy themselves by being subjected to each other.
With this system, even if your windows are open, you can create a peaceful environment in your home, free of noise."
The pyramids of Egypt were made with sound?
There are other interesting things that Pamir, one of Turkey's first sound engineers, has done.
For example, he built an outdoor disco in Ayvalik where music can't be heard from the outside.
The sound can't go beyond the boundary drawn, it's being compared to another sound frequency and destroyed.
Even in a room if you want to, you can make it quiet after a certain line.
Pamir also made a school gym suitable for both sports and concerts.
It's double-use.
Because when you play basketball, you need an echo, but there's no reverberation at concerts.
And in outdoor concerts, it's possible to provide a sound quality that only music can be heard.
"We use frequencies that destroy unnecessary sounds that are perceived as noise, correct human perception, allow music to perceive more clearly.
MTV's way ahead of us.
He holds outdoor concerts and sounds like a studio recording in the audio area," he says.
Tübitak had an experiment like this.
Separate the two aluminum plates from the sound frequencies.
There were scientists who claimed that Egyptian pyramids were also made with sound.
They think the stones could have been lifted and planted by sound.
I ask, "Isn't the sound convenient for bad purposes?"
"I was already terrified when I read about York University's work online, or if others read it.
Because even if the writing is tried by well-meaning people outside lab conditions, it can have incredibly bad consequences," he answers.
"Pray effective in Arabic"
Süden Pamir, who said noise pollution will also affect you negatively, explains why: "Because all the sounds that the ear hears are being transmitted to the brain.
Although one hears the sound of one concentrating alone, but the other sounds are transmitted to the brain and lead to fatigue.
You need to empty the brain, so it's good to walk naked in the soil, take nature walks.
I think that schools should be set up to absorb noise.
So the student concentrates on the voice of the lonely teacher and can concentrate longer."
Pamir, who says she believes prayers will also be effective if read from her Arabic because of the features of the audio frequencies, notes that Arabic has a very rich range of frequencies, noting that the sounds in the words are arranged to leave very positive effects when side by side.
"But you have to say the prayers out loud. I tremble when I read the Yasin period."
Frequency and love recipe
"Is it possible to make a person fall in love with the sound frequencies?"
Pamir's lovemaking, or rather the frequency description of one's emotions, is as follows: "First you have to find the dominant frequency that the person you want to love uses to talk.
You can influence it by using a higher frequency than this frequency.
Consider, for example, the dominant frequency of the person is 300.
And when you're with her, you want to play music that will stimulate her feelings.
If you lower the power of the one-digit ones from the frequencies above 300 frequencies of the music you're going to play and make the two-digit ones dominant, that person's impact capacity increases.
Maybe this way he'll fall in love with the person he's facing."
Pamir also mentions that politicians in the world have special sound systems so that they can speak more effectively, and when bass sounds are brought to the forefront, the politician is very strong, and a stage artist can be made to feel like a supernaturally magnificent being.
"There is a wall sound in Japan that is now believed to be blown by Michael on the day of the apocalypse, how do you think that would be?" Pamir replied, "I think it is a sound close to the human voice because the sound that affects man most is the sound close to his own voice.
For example, what is a magnificent instrument, as if it were produced from human breath."
'Gold prices will rise'
Canadian Jennings Capital Inc.'s Senior Gold Analyst Dan Hrushewsky stated that governments are struggling to reduce their debt through lowering the value of their currencies, so that gold prices will rise from its current level, stating that "Gold will continue its role as a safe-saving tool."
With the increase in global demand under last week's highest-grossing investment vehicle, Hrushewsky gave assessments to AA reporter on the rise observed in prices, stating that investors in China and India appear to be providing support for prices through low-price purchases of gold, saying, "The demand for gold from China is rising in relation to India, and Chinese investors play a major role in it."
Recalling that India is traditionally the largest gold buyer, Hrushewsky said, "I believe that the government's attempts to manage its current accounts by restricting gold imports are no longer in demand.
People will find a way through this framework."
Hrushewsky advised investors to invest in gold in the long run, saying, "Gold will continue to serve in the role of being a safe-saving tool.
The rising levels of debt from the 'disiplin deficiency' owned by many Western governments are being forgotten.
Governments are working to reduce their debt through devalued currencies.
Therefore, gold prices will rise from their current levels," he assessed.
"In the long run, gold improves its ability to reduce market risks"
Marcus Grubb, Director-General of Investment for the World Gold Council, said that gold is a physical entity that offers the ability to be simple, transparent and reliable in increasingly complex and volatile financial markets, adding, "In the long run, gold is improving in terms of its ability to reduce its basic developed properties and market risks.
Gold portfolios of small amounts proved to be much more durable and better at dealing with market ambiguities, showing that income stability has improved."
"The gold represents less than 1 per cent of total global investment assets.
This means that market opportunities for growth in gold investment are still very important.
In this quarter, strong capital entries to gold and coin, which increased 78 per cent compared to last year, show that investor interest in gold is protected."
"India must increase national gold stock to support economic growth"
Answering questions about the world's largest gold market India and China, Grubb quoted the decline in gold prices as promoting demand for jewelry, bullion gold and coin in the second quarter of the year, adding that this increased the investment appetite of consumers in Asia.
Grubb reminded me that the demand for jewelry in China increased by 54 per cent and in India by 51 per cent.
"In terms of demand for jewelry, China would usually be quiet in the second half.
Following the unexpected decline of gold prices in April, demand has risen and the jewelry store stocks have quickly run out," he said.
In addition to the government's restrictions on gold imports in India, Grubb stated that the Central Bank of India has taken many measures to support the falling rupee and reduce exchange outputs, stating, "In the nature of gold demand, it seems difficult to conduct restrictive demand practices at the retail level of gold, and therefore demand may meet unauthorized channels.
The World Gold Council believes India should see gold as a strategic investment entity, in accordance with its policies.
In addition, it should increase national gold stocks in support of economic growth in terms of long-term policy goals."
Global Golden Trends
According to the World Gold Council global Golden Trends report announced last week, global gold demand in the second quarter of this year had also been 856.3 tonnes, global coin and bullion gold investments of 508 tonnes.
In the second quarter of the year, a significant increase in the country's demand for jewelry was observed, compared to the same period the previous year, the demand for jewelry had risen by 54 per cent in China, 51 per cent in India, 38 per cent in Turkey and 33 per cent in the Middle East.
At the time, consumer demand in China continued to grow strong, with the prospect that prices would increase in the coming period, gold purchase increased 87 per cent compared to last year's quarter, reaching 276 tonnes in total this year.
In India, the government raised taxes in order to prevent the rise in gold imports in the first quarter, but consumer demand rose 71 per cent compared to last year, with 310 tonnes.
A warm Black Sea film: The Butlers of the Hill
The director is a doctor in Trabzon...
The actors are the lovely, red-cheeked, smiling residents of Flowery Plain Village, where the film was shot.
Love Free
There's no line, lots of improvisation and laughter in the film, which is only made on a $400,000 budget.
Under the leadership of Ismet Eradın, who is in love with cinema, today's film, "The Footmen of the Hill 1980", was intended to show everyone a true Black Sea story.
The premiere of the film "The Footmen of the Hill 1980", which was shot in the Flowering Straight Village of Akchabat, all of which consisted of amateur actors, also caused entertaining footage such as the film itself.
The attention of the press members to the gala, which took place at the Forum Mall Cinemas of Cinemaximum, was remarkable.
Having a rather crowded gala night, the team signed off on a spectacular night with the horons, the Black Sea songs.
The gala was attended primarily by Deputy Minister of Environment and Urbanism Muhammad Balta, Trabzon Mayor Dr. Orhan Fevzi Customscuoğlu, Provincial Police Director Ertan Slow, Provincial Director of Culture and Tourism İsmail Kanzaz, Akchaabat sub-Governor Abdul Rauf Ulusoy, Akchaabat Mayor Şefik Turkmen and several guests, as well as the directors of sponsor firms, national and local press representatives.
The film stars Samet Karahasanoğlu, Ayşe Öztürk, Koral Koç, Selahattin Çakır, Free Saral, Adem Eradın and Vahide Eradın.
Released today with 61 copies, the footmen of the Hill were first used in Turkey in 1980 to better understand the Black Sea accent.
The shining star on the hill!
Samet Karahasanoglu, a leading actor in the film, is only 18 years old.
From Samet, who lives in Trabzon, you watch what's best in the name of acting.
With an amateur theatrical background, the actor successfully gets up from under scenes loaded with comedy and drama in the film.
Samet Karahasanoğlu, who deserved the applause to the end, grabbed the phrase "one of the future's most wanted players" from the audience with his huge performance.
Comedy and drama together!
In the Flowery Plains Village of Trabzon, the subject of the film is as follows, which was happening at a time when the coup d'état of September 12, 1980 was imminent.
"The film's main character is young Hikmet's father working in Germany.
One of Hikmet's greatest dreams of continuing his winter school and shepherding during the summer is to complete his studies and become a doctor.
But it's not much to study and study.
Especially when his love for Zuleyha, the daughter of the richest family in the village, is added to it.
Against Hikmet, who has decided to tell Züleyha about this love he has kept within him for years, with the suggestion that he has received from his friends, there is a formidable obstacle, such as Zuleyha's father, Sabri Agha.
Sabri Agha has other plans for his daughter.
On the other hand, the 'top' on which surrounding villages unite and match is one of their biggest obsessions, and it has waged a war against the villagers over this hill."
Long metraja from short film...
In the Gala, the film's screenwriter and director, Dr. Ismet Eradın, made the following statements about the Hill's Servants 1980, which they filmed on a very small budget:
"When we started this film, our goal was to make a short film.
But the footage of the first shots got so much attention on social media that we started to get excited and attracted to feature.
When we went to Istanbul to the distributor, they said, "Do you have a celebrity player?"
And I said, "We don't have any glory, but I have 86 Black Sea players you can't find anywhere."
To date, very bad accents have been used in films and shows made, and the Black Sea man has been misrepresented.
You're about to see 86 original Black Sea people in the next movie.
I tried to make a Black Sea movie.
I wish someone else would have done it before me so we could have seen a non-curious comedy.
If the Black Sea wasn't misrepresented, I wouldn't have made this movie.
It's the first time we ever put a Turkish subtitle in a Turkish film.
That'll be a first.
We did it so the Black Sea accent would be better understood.
We also put a subtitle in the film that translates the English speech scenes into the Black Sea accent.
When we made this movie, whoever we turned the camera into turned out to be an actor.
The footmen of the Hill is our first film.
I may have my faults, my shortcomings."
Don't miss this warm film that brings a new breath to the Black Sea movies!
Beware of Selecting Your Perfume!
You are sensitive to taking care of your personal care, and be careful if you are one of those who exaggerates and walks around with a bottle of perfume.
The perfume you use can cause skin diseases.
We spoke with Dr. Funda Ataman, an expert in Civatte Poikilodermia, which is more common in women and comes from various cosmetics, especially perfumes.
The sideparts of the Civatte Poikiloderma are revealed to be skin coloring disorder seen in the neck and breast cleavage (the area below the chin that the chin shaded is untainted) by Uzm. Dr. Ataman; ‘It often arises depending on staying in the sun in light-colored people.
It is seen in the form of brown red stains.
The skin is thin, veiny, and hair roots are prominent.
Pulse dye is one of the options for laser treatment and protection from the sun.
Another is the use of creams containing retinoic acid.
These creams need to be used for a long time.
The rash, which can appear during use, to the dry, the itch is not a side effect or allergy.
In this case, treatment must be continued intermittently.
Because it can be family, those with Civatte Poikiloderma in their parents need to be conscious of protection and treatment early in life.'
Huge decrease in cigarette consumption
The amount of cigarettes smoked in Turkey in the first six months of this year declined by 10 per cent compared to the same period last year, down to 41 billion 779m.
The amount of cigarettes smoked in Turkey in the first six months of this year declined by 10 per cent compared to the same period last year, down 41 billion 779m 190,560.
According to information from the Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Agency (TAPDK), the Global Adult Tobacco Research (KYTA), carried out by the Turkish Statistical Agency in Turkey to obtain information on the state of adults using tobacco products and to create a data source for decision-makers and researchers on the issue, has been completed.
According to research results, 31.2 per cent of individuals aged 15 and higher across Turkey (16 million people) used tobacco products daily or occasionally in 2008, which fell to 27.1 per cent (14.8 million people) in 2012, and the frequency of tobacco use decreased by 13.4 per cent.
41.5% of men, 13.1% of women use tobacco.
The proportion of tobacco useers fell from 47.9 per cent in men to 41.5 per cent, and in women from 15.2% to 13.1 per cent.
According to the study, 6 out of 10 tobacco users are considering quitting smoking.
The proportion of those planning to leave the tobacco product within a month was 12.9 per cent and the rate of those planning to leave it within 12 months was 35.4 per cent.
In the evaluation section of the study, the following opinions were included:
"The net conclusion in terms of consumption of tobacco products indicates that tobacco control laws and the National Tobacco Control Program and Action Plan are effective in Turkey.
Thus, the number of tobacco consumers has decreased by 2 million 200,000 people from 2008 to 2012, with the frequency of use reduced by 4.1 percent.The most significant reduction in smoking use has been in prices-sensitive areas such as young people and undereducated people.
According to the World Health Organization's 2013 Report on Global Tobacco Convulsion, Turkey was the first and only country to achieve all criteria by achieving high level success in terms of tobacco control.
The report asked other countries to follow and imitate Turkey."
The ban on smoking in closed spaces continues to take effect.
During the first six months of this year, the amount of cigarettes smoked declined by 10 per cent compared to the same period last year, down 41 billion 779 million 190,560.
This figure was located at 46 billion 325 million 44,100 levels during the same period of 2012.
The walls will be touch screens now!
Ubi Interactive has put Microsoft's 'Kinect' technology on sale for a very interesting product.
Microsoft had incorporated Kinect into the Kinect Accelerator program last year to support projects that would use it on Windows.
The software giant provided money, location, hardware support for these companies.
One of the most interesting software demos to come up through the Kinect Accelerator was shown by Ubi Interactive.
In the demo, an ordinary projector meets with Kinect for Windows, and the projection on the wall is turned into a giant touch screen.
According to a new post on the Kinect for Windows website, there are several companies testing this technology.
The software tested by over 50 institutions during the special beta process is now being sold to everyone by Ubi.
Prices are available on Ubi's website.
For a 45-inch touch screen, you have to give up $149.
A 100-inch touch screen that can detect 20 points of touch will cost you $1,499.
Ubi's software and Kinect for Windows are included in the prices, but you need to buy the projector separately.
Another innovation to the Android!
With this patent Google has received, it will make it even easier to send files.
Among the mobile operating systems, Android and Android, Google, who was by far first, patented a new interface technology that would often benefit those who shared files with their friends.
The function for content sharing through wireless technologies such as NFC and Bluetooth is actually not very different from Android Beam and Apple Airdrop samples.
The last innovation that carries Google signature is that it allows it to spread this function to user groups around the area instead of one-time sharings, and by drag - let alone offering its convenience to users.
The new feature appears to be in future Android versions...
Here is Turkey's first domestic smartphone
Turkcell got into the smart phone business.
The factory of smartphones to be co-produced with China will be in Turkey.
It's called T40.
Turkcell introduced Turkey's first domestic smartphone.
The TCELL design will release its smartphone T40 in Turkey, which will also be produced in Turkey along with China, at the end of September.
Turkcell General Manager Süreyya Ciliv said they planned to offer the smartphone T40, developed in collaboration with US chip manufacturer Qualcomm and introduced in February as the Gebze project, for sale in all nine countries Turkcell operates.
Ciliv, who gave a presentation at T40's launch, also said they were having talks with Turkish manufacturers, saying "Some of the T40 will be produced in China; it will be produced in Turkey by the end of the year in 2013."
APPARENT EXPLOSION
Ciliv said they would present the phone at an appropriate price, saying they would announce the final price close to the sale.
Ciliv said they aim to increase data usage by offering the market a smartphone at a more accessible price than benefiting from the sale of devices with the T40.
Ciliv said that 1 million of Turkcell's T-series phones for sale from 2010 had been sold, which drew the foreign trade deficit down to $500m.
He'll be dead soon.
Turkcell Director General Süreyya Ciliv said T40 would have features such as noise blocking, high resolution sound, round sound, and adjustable user interface.
Ciliv said the price of the T40 would be announced before the phone was released, the price of the phone would be appropriate.
5 MILLION DOLLARS GO OUT EVERY YEAR
"57% of the calls to Turkey are smartphones.
Because of this increase in rate, the average price of phones sold came to $300.
We import $5 billion in phones from 15 million each year, and my concern is that this is going to increase."
The T40, which will run on the Android operating system platform, will have a Qualcomm double core processor and 1 GB RAM feature.
They're all imam orators!
Registration of students studying at normal secondary school was renewed as imam orator secondary school students
The MEB had converted all primary schools located in Turkey last year as elementary schools, secondary schools and imam oratory secondary schools following a 4+4+4 arrangement in education.
After a year of training, the ministry turned several schools into imam oratories in the direction of the re-established "need", and was found to have signed a new scandal during the conversion proceedings.
The "transformation" scandal, which could interest current students of all schools translated into imam oratory secondary schools in Turkey this year, was raised during conversion and registration renewal procedures at Sugar Middle School in Meram district, Konya.
A year of normal secondary school
Sugar Elementary School was converted to secondary school early last year following a 4+4+4 arrangement.
At school, elementary school 3rd and 4th graders who would transition gradually to another school under the system were studying together in secondary school 6, 7th and 8th graders.
Serving as a normal secondary school for one year, the school was converted to imam orator secondary school with the end of the 2012-2013 school year.
The school, translated into an Imam orator, first accepted 5th grade students as "Imam orator students" to the school this year.
However, last year, records of students who were in the 5th grade at the regular middle school and who were to move to the 6th grade this year were automatically renewed as an imam orator secondary school student in electronic environment.
‘Another school that doesn't want '
Upon learning the situation, parents complained by coming to school.
However, according to instructions from the provincial national education directorate, the school board told parents, "Parents who do not want their children to continue in the imam oratorium can move their enrollment to another secondary school."
An interesting statement from the Konya Provincial National Education Directorate has been made.
"By considering preferences with student and school numbers, we re-transmitted some schools with the possibility of the Governorate of Konya.In this scope, 15-20 schools in Konya were also turned into imam oratories.
Schools access the ministry's e-school system with school codes.
However, when the school is turned into an imam orator, the code for the old school is deleted from the system.
The new school code needs to be opened to register students in the system.
Those schools also transferred students to imam orator secondary school using the new institution code so that both students and teachers would not be victims.
Any parent can take their children's transfers from these schools and give them to other schools."

Prosecutor called the ministry ‘dispute'
The family ministry's request was denied
SYYME NATIONAL / VATAN ISTHIBARAT
In the case of Abbas Şahin, who killed his wife Pınar Şahin, who filed for divorce, the prosecutor dismissed the request of the Ministry of Family, who demanded involvement in the case, on the grounds that there was no violence.
The first hearing of the trial in Bakırköy 5th Heavy Penal Court was attended by Abbas Şahin, Pınar Şahin’s mother Ayşe Twin, her older sister Gift Twin.
