Wales Parliamentary Members are afraid to "look like puppets"
His proposal to change titles as a member of the Wales Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament) has sparked concern among some members of parliament.
This concern came from a plan to change the name of the council to the Wales Parliament.
Parliamentary members in the political spectrum are concerned that this name may be considered ridiculous.
One of the Labour Parliamentary Members said the party is concerned that the name rhymes with "Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales, in Welsh, "twp" is crazy, and "pwp" means pooping.
A Plaid Party member suggested an alternative, saying the party's "not pleased" in general.
One of the Gal Conservative Party members said that people at his party were "open-minded" about the change of name, while the MWP said there was a little word play for Muppet.
In this context, the word "w" in Gaelic is pronounced like a "u" in Yorkshire.
"The final decision on describing what to call members of parliament will surely belong to the members of parliament," the Parliamentary Commission, which is currently drafting a bill for name changes, said.
With the government of 2017, the Welsh Parliament was given the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission issued public opinion results on proposals that have been greatly supported in naming the parliament's name as the Wales Parliament.
Regarding the titles of the parliamentary members, the Commission was in favour of the Wales Parliament Members (WMP), while the MWP was the most supported option for public opinion.
The members of parliament are clearly making different options, but consensus could give Elin Jones a headache, who is expected to submit the bill on amendments in the coming weeks.
The law on innovation will include some changes in the way parliament works, including the rules, including the disqualification of members from parliament and the order of the committee system.
Members will decide which name they will take when they discuss the law.
Macedonians to hold referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
This vote was brought to an end to decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, a neighbouring country in a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its neighbour's name represents his claim on the territory of the north, but has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the public vote on the change of name, said he would not consider the vote.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Are Silent Like Churches in the Harlem Problem
"The old people I've been talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
"Now they're both gone."
Adams says it's understandable that bars are missing.
"Now people are socializing in different ways," he said.
"Bars aren't regular neighborhood halls anymore."
As for churches, Adams is concerned that the money obtained by selling goods will not be enough for the leaders as long as they expected, and that they will "return to where they began sooner or later".
He added that churches would be replaced by apartments of people who would not help the rest of the neighborhood’s temples.
"The majority of the people who buy apartments from these apartments will be very white, so it will speed up the closure of all churches together, because most of the people who move into these apartments are unlikely to be members of these churches," he said.
Both churches were built by white communities in 1870 before the Metropolitan Community, and ten years later before the black metropolitan city, St. Martin's.
The original white Methodist community moved in in the 1930s.
A black community in the area took possession of the building.
Father John Howard Johnson led the boycott against stores that resisted hiring and promotion of black people on the 125th Street, which was a main street for shopping in Harlem, and took over a black community that led St. Martin.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson's followers ordered a bell set because they were planning to rebuild it.
Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, Father David Johnson, proudly described the bell set as "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who rang the bells in July gave the team another name: "A cultural treasure" and "an unprecedented historical tool."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that this team was the first bell to be played by a black musician in the world, and this was Dionisio A. Lind, who went to the larger bell team at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What's been happening in St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story, some of which are outside the church, some of which are found by the diocese, where architects and contractors play a role.
In July, the governing body of non-priest leaders of the church sent a message to the diocese, worried that the council would "stretch on them", even though it had no part in hiring architects and contractors sent by bishops.
Some of the congregation complained that there was no transparency in the church.
In California, the shark injured the 13-year-old who dived for lobster.
According to authorities, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy diving in California on the day of lobster season on Saturday.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. off Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that half an hour after he started diving with his friends on Saturday morning, he heard the boy screaming for help and went to the boat with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought the kid was screaming in the excitement of finding lobster, but then he realized, "He bit me! He bit me!"
He told me.
Hammel told me what he saw when he went to see the boy, "The entire foam bone was open."
"I told everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition was determined to be critical.
The species of the attacking shark is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles informed the press that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
For 48 hours, authorities sealed off access to the coasts in the region, from the Ponto coast in Casablanca to the Swami coast in Equinitas, for research and security reasons.
Giles said there are about 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's includes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, with department store-style beauty departments and specialist staff.
As Britain's fashion and household goods sales drop, it will continue to grow as part of a strong entry into the 2.8 billion-pound cosmetic market, with larger cosmetics in 11 stores across the country being tested, and if it succeeds, it will be moved to more stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics comes from supermarkets looking for ways to fill shelves previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's presentation of Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw said it would be the first time that the number of cosmetic products would be 3,000.
The brands from L'Oreal to Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be more available, as are the brands found in stores such as Boots.
At the same time, the supermarket re-sells the Boutique makeup series so that most of its products will become vegan products that are increasingly demanding by young customers.
Also, the Fragrance Shop, a perfume salesman, will be at two Sainsbury's stores that will open in Croydon, South London, and Selly Oak, Birmingham this year.
With my willingness to shop online and buy daily meals from small local stores, supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury's General Manager Mike Coupe said the sales points would increasingly resemble department stores to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount stores, which provide more non-food services.
Since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, he's been putting Argos stands in hundreds of stores, including some Habitat stands, and he says it supports market sales and raises profits.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals department was a failure.
Sainsbury's tried to open a joint store with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after they had a disagreement about sharing the revenues of pharmacies in their supermarket.
After selling Sainsbury's 281-store pharmacy company to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds pharmacy chain, a new strategy emerged three years ago after selling it for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds is said to play a part in the plan by adding luxury skin care brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
"We changed the appearance and feeling of our cosmetics in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in special trained colleagues who are ready to give advice.
Our branding series was designed to meet all needs, and our attractive environment and convenient positions mean that we are a cosmetics salesman who is challenging the old shopping style," he said.
Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the £11 million deal made Peter Jones angry.
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, left the program "indignant" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a life-style deal for £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Really's Homewear and Accessories.
The work of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
This Morning's 37-year-old server quit on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby raged against Dragons' Den's star Peter Jones, leaving his lifestyle brand job at the last minute to focus on his new lucrative contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, when Marlow, the golden daughter of television, admitted at a nervous meeting at the centre of the business empire in Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that their new £1.5 million deal meant that she no longer had enough time for household clothing and accessories to spare Truly, Jones was "infuriated."
The firm was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and it was said that Willoughby doubled his estimated wealth of £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, explained on Instagram that he had left Truly, Jones took his jet to one of the vacation homes outside of England.
One source said, "Truly was clearly first among Holly's priorities.
He would have a long-term future to support him for the next 20 years.
Holly's decision to withdraw completely shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, he was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods ready to sell at Marlow HQ."
Experts believe that the departure of the British's most box office-maker, This Morning program server, could cost the company millions of pounds, due to serious investments in various products from pillows to candles, clothing to household clothing, and the potential to be released late.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones became president in March 52.
Couples are on vacation together, and Jones has 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be M&S's brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin, the host of the I'm A Celebrity program on ITV.
"We don't comment on his business issues," a source close to Jones said last night.
"We fell in love while we were talking hard."
He made a joke about media criticisms that some would find "insubordinate to the presidency" and because it was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded by pretending to be the news anchor:
"I haven't given up on anything."
After Trump described his first call for a meeting in Singapore as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament in June, he said Kim was interested in a second meeting.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have been interrupted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had "no response" to previous disarmament moves from the United States.
Instead, he said, the United States is continuing its sanctions to continue the pressure.
Trump showed much more optimism in his rally speech.
He said, "We're great with North Korea."
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were going to die.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that developing relations with Kim brought positive results, such as finishing rocket tests, releasing hostages, and returning the rest of the American soldiers home.
He also defended his extraordinary approach to talking to Kim about his relationship.
"It is very easy to act in a presidential manner, but instead of 10,000 people trying to enter this narrow space, there will be 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing out to the crowd in front of him.
In Indonesia, Tsunami and Earthquake Hit Island, Hundreds of People Die
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were said to be unneeded.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population were located, no national disasters were reported as a prerequisite for facilitating international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not want international help, so it is difficult," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children has assembled a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether the foreign team will be able to work on the field.
National disaster agency spokesman Sutopo said Indonesian officers evaluated the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid.
Given Indonesia's constant earthquake, the country is not prepared enough for nature's wrath.
There are no tsunami shelters in Aceh, but there are no such studies on the other coasts.
Although there was a warning on Palu, it is possible that the absence of tsunami warning sirens caused the loss of life.
Even in the best case, it's hard to travel between many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area affected by the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made developing Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure the most important part of the election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But financing the deficiencies has forced Joko's administration because next year there will be a reelection.
Joko also faces pressure from sectarian conflicts in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority embraces a more conservative belief.
The conflict of Christian and Muslim gangs, using knives and bows and other primitive weapons in the street, killed more than 1,000 people and led to tens of thousands of people's homes.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a draw against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved his team from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London in the 89th minute.
Sturridge took a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 yards from Chelsea's goal when his team was down 1-0.
He took the ball lightly to his left, and then he shot at the far post.
The shot flew over the penalty area as it went to the upper right side of the castle.
Finally, the ball hit Kepa Arrizabalaga and hit the nets.
"I was just trying to get the ball and find a position. Players like Shaq always go as far as they can. I tried to buy as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once, I shot without thinking too much."
In the 25th minute, Chelsea scored the goal with Belgian star Eden Hazard, leading the first half 1-0.
Before Blue's striker ran from midfield to Liverpool half-field, Mateo gave Kovacic a heel pass in the game.
Kovacic made a quick hit and run in midfield.
Then he passes a nice pass and brings Hazard to the penalty point.
Hazard crossed the defense and left-footed Liverpool player Alisson Becker with a shot through the back of the net.
Liverpool will play against Naples at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will meet Videoton in London on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in the UEFA European League.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami increased to 832.
Indonesia's emergency response agency said early Sunday that the country's earthquake rose to 832 deaths in the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the representative of the agency, said at a press conference that the earthquake that hit the country on Friday (7.5) was reported that many people were under construction debris, causing waves at 20 feet high.
With more than 380,000 populations, the city of Palu was flooded with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation was launched this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street with stab wounds, and a 32-year-old male was detained for suspected murder.
The police wanted people in the area to come forward who had heard or seen anything about it.
"The investigation is under way, but I call on anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also call on taxi drivers to contact us, especially those who may have been able to capture something with road cams, because they may have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a native of Birkenhead, who was found in a private property.
This afternoon, some friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene this morning asking questions about the whereabouts of the victim.
Investigations continue as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A cab driver in Grayson Mews just tried to break into his apartment, but the police said no one was allowed inside or outside the building.
The driver was speechless when he found out what was going on.
I've just been told that it will take hours for the residents to be allowed back into their homes.
It was heard that a police officer told another man that the entire area was now a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She kept repeating, "It's so terrible what's going on."
At 2:00 in the afternoon, two police vans were in the cordon, and another was just outside the cordon.
A couple of police officers were standing in the cordon watching the apartment buildings.
Anyone with information is asked to write in private to @MerPolCC or to call 101 or contact 0800 555 112, the special and secret line of stopping crime, without naming it, from 247 of the September 30th journal.
The Cromwell statue in front of parliament was the last target in the debate on "renew history"
The banishment of the statue would be divine justice for Cromwell's fanatical Puritan followers, who have destroyed many cultural and religious monuments in England.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said, "In the current debate over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell figure in front of Westminster Palace was the target.
The iconism of British civil wars was not carried out by Cromwell, nor were these wars fought by his command.
Perhaps a false Cromwell would have been sacrificed instead of his ancestor Thomas from the previous century.
The great representation of Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is proof of 19th century vision, and Cromwell is a figure that is still a part of history writing that many people consider worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph, "Cromwell is seen as an advocate of the monarchy in his case, perhaps more than most in the 19th century, against the pressures of the outside.
It's an ongoing historical debate whether that's exactly the right statement.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known figure representing a side of this conflict.
His achievements as Guardian Lord are also worth celebrating and celebrating."
Murderer Pig Beats Up Chinese Farmer
According to the local media report, a farmer was attacked and killed in a marketplace in southwest China.
According to the South Chinese Morning Post on Sunday, the man identified only by his last name "Yuan" was found near the pigsty in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, covered in blood with severed arteries.
On 30 May 2005, in Qinghai, China, a pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig pen.
It's said that he and his cousin left the neighboring state of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs in the market on Wednesday.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
His cousin said there was a large male pig in the pigsty with blood on his mouth.
The coroner's report confirmed that a giant pig of 550 pounds had beaten the farmer to death.
According to Guiyang Main News, his cousin, last name called "Wu", said: "My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed."
Security footage shows Yuan entering the mall Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed him wasn't Yuan's pig or his cousin's.
While the police were gathering evidence at the scene, one of the mall managers told Main News that he was being shut down to prevent a pig from attacking someone.
It is said that Yuan's family and the authorities in the mall are negotiating compensation for Yuan's death.
Even though it's rare, the cases where pigs attack people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked her and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig trapped a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
A farmer from Oregon was defeated by his own pigs in 2012, and a Manitoba farmer told the CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that blood tastes can be a "trigger".
The farmer said, "The pigs are just joking.
They're curious clamps... they're not after hurting you.
You just need to respect them enough," he said.
What's left of the Rosa storm brings heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
According to the weather forecast, hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves on colder waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods to the north of Mexico and to the northwest of the United States.
As of 5:00 p.m., Rosa, the 1st Category was a hurricane, and the wind was 85 miles per hour, and on Sunday Eastern time, the hurricane was 385 miles from the southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to leave north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure strip is formed along the Pacific Ocean, moving east towards the west side of the United States, and on Monday, Rosa will start pushing deep tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the United States as it approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm.
On Monday, Rosa will make it 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, the tropical humidity will interact with the approaching low pressure strip, creating a large amount of precipitation in the southwest in the coming days.
Regionally, rainfalls from 1 to 4 inches will likely lead to ground shifts in the desert, in addition to rapid floods, debris flows.
The deep tropical humidity will bring the rainfall rates closer to two to three inches per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest regions, especially in most of Arizona, there is expected to be enough rain to reach two to four inches.
Due to the disorganized nature of tropical rain, rapid debilitating conditions are likely to flood the water.
On a tropical rain warning, it is extremely dangerous to risk going to the desert on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and the borrans can bring dust from the local winds.
The approaching low pressure strip will leave some heavy rains on the southern California coast.
It is possible to develop a total of half-inch rainfalls that could cause small debris flows and roads to get slippery.
This will be the first rain in the region.
By the end of Monday, before the rains spread to broader areas on Tuesdays, some tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday, early Monday.
Heavy rainfall will spread through the Four Corners district on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, while the poles cool, some heat emissions can be seen throughout the United States due to the fact that tropical belts remain quite warm.
Sometimes this can lead to sudden temperature changes along small distances.
There's a great example of sudden temperature changes that formed across the middle United States on Sunday.
There's about 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, Nebraska, and there's the same difference between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the late summer temperature will rise and try to spread again.
In many parts of the Middle and East United States, along with October, the 80-degree latitude is expected to feel a temperature starting from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City can see 80 Fahrenheit, about 10 degrees above normal.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests high probability of temperatures for eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
In an exciting statement Thursday, the Supreme Court's candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who allegedly accused him of sexual harassment in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, were watched by more than 20 million people from six different television networks.
Meanwhile, his non-politicism continued with the broadcasters' regular schedule on Friday, a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct the FBI's investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford told the U.S. Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh was 100% certain that he was trying to touch himself while he was drunk at a high school party and take off his clothes.
Kavanaugh said he's 100% sure there's nothing to be said in his exciting statement.
According to Nielsen, it is possible that more than 20.4 million people will watch the trial on Friday.
The company calculated the average number of spectators based on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of other networks showing the trial, including the Fox Business Network, was not immediately reached by the C-SPAN.
Moreover, Nielsen is often having trouble calculating the number of people watching things in the office.
In other words, this number of spectators was the size of a qualifying match in American football or the audience of the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose idea servers strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, has left all the Aghas behind with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the day's trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second in line with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, CNN by 2.52 million.
After the trial, high attention continued.
In Friday's drama, Flake was the face at the center.
After the moderate Republican office announced that Kavanaugh would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Kavanaugh caught CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning when he was booing protesters while trying to take the elevator to the Justice Committee trial.
Standing in front of his head for a few minutes while he was severely rebuked, it was broadcast live on CNN.
A woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"You think he's telling the country the truth?
In its shape, Kavanaugh was told, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office made a statement before the elevator closed, that he had more to say at the committee's hearing.
After hours of cable and broadcast networks, the Justice Committee moved Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate for the vote.
However, Flake said, only if the FBI investigates crimes against the island during a week, which is required by minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after he talked to Coons and some senators.
Flake's election had an effect because it was obvious that Republicans couldn't have the number of votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politicising" over the Brexit issue
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticised Britain's plans to leave the European Union of "making political materials" and damaging national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, right next to May's front page interview, former foreign minister Boris Johnson strengthened May's move against his so-called "dating game" for Brexit, saying May's proposal, which is to collect the taxes of Britain and the EU, was "all nonsense".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as suspect in the death of the player playing LSU (Louisa State University)
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims in LSU.
Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for second-degree murder.
Authorities released video footage of Sims and Simpson facing Sims, police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS's WAFB, the cop who took the glasses from the crime scene said that Simpson's DNA sample was found on the glasses.
After we questioned Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde dead.
The defendant's bail was set at $350,000, he said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner's office issued a preliminary statement Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot fired from the neck.
The department has handed over the Louisiana State Police arrest squad, the state police murder lab, the South University, and the people of the region, to help with the investigation that ended in the arrest.
LSU sports manager Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement forces on behalf of their efforts "in search of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
His father Wayne's six-foot six-inch striker, played for LSU, grew up in Baton Rouge.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "harmless" and "shocked" with Wayde's death.
Wade said, "That's what you've always been worried about."
The volcano sprayed ash on Mexico City
Ashes erupting from the popotepetl volcano have reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after its crater. In 24 hours, 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded.
The centre watched a lot of shaking and thunder.
Social media footage showed that Mexico City covered the windshields of cars in thin layers of ash in neighboring cities like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists also detected an increase in activity in the volcano 45 miles south of the capital since the earthquake rocked central Mexico with 7.1 violence in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with separatist Catalans prior to the anniversary of the independence game
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, the arrests followed the agile clash of pro-independence protesters, and thousands attended opposition demonstrations to celebrate the first anniversary of the polarizing game for Katalunia's departure.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the riot forces, who poured eggs at the police and threw dust paint at them, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
At the end of the day, the struggle broke out as the police used their baton to contain the fight.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups have read songs against Union protesters who cried "Long live Spain", saying, "No forgetting, no forgiveness."
Fourteen people were treated as a result of minor injuries in the protests, local media reported.
The tension remained high in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1st referendum, declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the separatist Catalans.
Voters chose to remain overwhelmingly independent, but the turnout remained low, as those opposed to separation boycotted voting.
According to Catalan officials, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent people from going to their voting points with violent conflicts throughout the region.
The pro-independence groups set up tents on Friday to block a one-night show of support for the national police.
The show started, but he had to follow a different course.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in the separatist protests with his wife, said he is no longer hopeful that Katalunia will gain independence.
Narcis: "We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying because they could vote, but now we're stuck."
Although they were able to achieve a small but crucial victory last December, the Catalian separatist parties had difficulty maintaining momentum this year because they were either in forced exile or because they were awaiting the hearing in custody for their role in organizing the declaration of independence that followed it through a referendum.
Recording the protest against police support on his phone, 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig said the debate was played by politicians on both sides.
Joan Puig said, "The situation is getting more and more tense."
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were in prison before trial last year, announced he will compete in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Becoming a candidate for elections in Europe is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values, the pressure we see from the Spanish government," Oriol said.
Londonderry: Some men were arrested after a car hit a house
Three men between 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
On Thursday, the incident occurred at Balllynagard Crescent, approximately 7:30 p.m. in the summer hours of England.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the doors and the building.
At some point, the car could have been shot with a crossbow.
Livingston beat the Rangers 1-0 with Menga's shot.
Dolly Menga's first goal brings the win to Livingston
In 18 matches, Livingston became the manager of the Ibrox club, he shocked the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard a second taste of his defeat.
While the difference was Dolly Menga's shot, Gary Holt's team moved up to second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team still hasn't won an away victory at the Premiership this season, and will face Hearts, the leader who is eight points behind next Sunday.
Before this match, the Rangers will host Rapid Wien at the European League game on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, scored six games in the league of invincibility, and Holt, head coach, hasn't met defeat since he took over from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston has missed positions in front of the dull guest team.
Holt's team gave the Rangers all kinds of trouble with his open play, and he could've been ahead long before he scored.
Scott Robinson made his move, but his effort wasn't enough to score, and then Alan Lithgow's ball went out in a different way to meet Craig Halkatt's head shot.
The home team let the Rangers take the lead, knowing they're gonna have a hard time with the guest team.
That's how the big score came in.
The Rangers gave the team a free kick, and in Livingston's organization, Declan Gallagher and Robinson threw the ball at Menga, and Menga scored by hitting the ball in the middle of the penalty box.
At that point, the Rangers were more likely to have the ball, but the homeowner was having a hard time getting past his defense, and Liam Kelly, the goalie, didn't have a big problem,
This game model continued until the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save one.
As Scott Pittman stood in the way of the Rangers' goalie Allan McGregor's feet, Lithgow threw the ball out in another Livingston's tackle.
While all the middles of the Livingston penalty zone were suspended, Halkett's involvement in backup player Glenn Middleton and a hand play was rejected by the referee.
"Extraordinary" Match by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
An extraordinary performance and result for Livingston.
Every player on the team was perfect, and as a result of their release, they continued to exceed expectations.
Game style and staff haven't changed much since he got back to the top of the league, but Holt, who's been firing the team since his arrival, deserves the biggest credit.
Holt had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett led a great defense that was organized, and Menga harassed Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall during the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've fallen far behind on their good performance from time to time under Gerrard.
They failed the last ball, and they only made it past the opposing defense once, and this could be a wake-up call for Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the league.
Erdogan receives both good and bad in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) when Turkey and Germany's leaders met for breakfast in Berlin, there were smiling faces and blue skies.
The meeting took place on the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to restore ties between NATO allies.
Two countries have had disagreements about human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne and opened a new huge mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters around the nearby area were ready to see the president.
Hundreds of opposition protestors, mostly from Kurds, also announced their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to host him in the country.
Opposite protests show how a visitor, who was considered a hero by some Turks living in Germany, and some viewed as dictators, led to a rift.
Car accident in Deptford: Bicyclist killed in a collision with car
In London, a bicycle rider died in a collision involving an automobile.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British Summertime.
The car driver stopped and the paramedics intervened, but the person died at the scene.
Saturday's accident occurred a few months after another cyclist was hit and killed on Childers Street, about a mile from the site.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify him and notify his family.
Road has been blocked, bus routes have been changed, and drivers have been advised to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers wounded in turmoil
The prison administration said six prison officers were injured in a disturbance in a high-security men's prison.
On Sunday, at around 9:30 p.m. in Worcestershire, the confusion emerged and continued in Long Lartin, at His Majesty's Prison (Every Majestic's Prison (HMP).
The authorities of the "Tornado" have been brought in to deal with the disturbance involving eight prisoners and one wing stopped.
Authorities with minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
"In order to solve the ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin, special-edited prison workers have been assigned.
Six staff wounds have been treated.
We cannot tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are determined that those responsible will be sent to the police and remain behind bars longer."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the warden was treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, rioters were called to the prison to resolve a serious disturbance in which officers were attacked by billiard balls.
Due to Hurricane Rosa, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, flood danger.
It's rare that a tropical depression hit Arizona, but the energy left by Hurricane Rosa earlier in the week has led to flood hazards across the southwest desert.
The National Weather Predictation Agency issued floods Mondays and Tuesdays for the region covering Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, all the way to West Arizona and South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah.
Rosa is expected to approach by rain at the end of Monday to adopt a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday.
"Since 1950, only ten tropical hurricanes, tropical storms, or depression have created a situation around Phoenix 200 miles [200 km] around Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest National Hurricane Center models estimate a two to four-inch precipitation along the Arizona Mogollon edge, with a total of six inches.
Other regions of the Southwest Desert, including the Middle Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, can receive 1 to 2 inches of rain and can reach 4 inches of volume in isolated areas.
Rosa's rains can be a blessing in areas that are not at risk of floods because of drought in the region.
Although the flood is a serious problem, some of these rains may be useful now that the Southwest is experiencing drought conditions.
"A little more than 40 per cent of Arizona, according to the United States Dryness Observatory, is experiencing extreme drought problems, at least the second highest category," Weather.com reported.
First of all, Hurricane Rosa's road is moving through Mexico's Baja California peninsula for the first time to contact land.
At 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, Rosa, Punta Eugenia, still in hurricane power, is located 385 miles south of Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is getting faster because it encounters colder waters in the Pacific.
Therefore, Monday afternoon or evening the tropical storm force is expected to reach Mexico soil.
Severe rains in some parts of Mexico could pose a significant risk of flooding.
Weather.com reported that "a total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected between Batha California and Northwest Sonora, and it is possible to reach 10 inches."
Rosa will then follow the tropical storm north of Mexico, reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then entering South Utah late Tuesday nights.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is that it causes a very intense oil in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the Southwest desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Centre said.
These rains are expected to cause floods that could threaten life, mud currents in the desert, and land slides in mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three young children and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found wounded with a knife in Somerset.
The young boy was found injured in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace district on Saturday around 4:00 p.m. British Summertime.
He's been taken to the hospital, and his condition is "stable."
Four men, 17 years old, 18 years old and 20 years old, were arrested in the Redstock area at midnight, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
Authorities have turned to anyone who might have had a video on his cell phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh was the victim of the Democratic Party's "failure and anger".
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and excessive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
During Kavanaugh's candidacy process, he said, the Democratic Party was "the victim of humiliation and anger".
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he had sexually harassed both of them when they were young.
Ford testified at the trial about his own claim.
"The American people saw Kavanaug's light, quality and courage that day.
A vote that approves of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that will approve one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with valuable achievements in public service."
Speaking of the importance of Republican turnout, the president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's candidacy.
"One of the most important choices of our lives is five weeks away.
I'm not running, but I'm really running."
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claimed the Democrats were taking over the "resistance and obstruction" mission.
A senior Republican Party deputy executive told CNN that the first major vote for Kavanaugh's candidacy in the Senate is expected on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds died in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, the balance sheet is rising.
At least 384 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi on Saturday, authorities said, and a large number of people were caught in huge waves hitting the beaches.
On Friday, as it was dark in Palu, the waves reached 20 feet [18 m] high, hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach and destroyed everything that stood in its way as the waves dragged many people to their deaths.
There was a tsunami after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When yesterday's tsunami threat broke out, people continued their activities on the beach, they didn't immediately escape and were victims of the incident," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB agency in Indonesia's disaster reduction agency, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"It wasn't just a tsunami; it dragged cars, trees and houses along with it, and it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was travelling at 800 km/sa (497 km/sa) in the open sea before reaching the coast.
He said some people climbed trees and survived to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 headquarters in Palu.
Photos from the air released by the Disaster Agency found that several buildings and shops had been destroyed, bridges had been bent and a mosque had been flooded.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued in the coastal city.
One after another, earthquakes were felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Applications (BPPT) said the energy generated by Friday's massive tremor was nearly 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It was said that the geography of the city at the end of a narrow and long bay could have enlarged the tsunami size.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide-scale" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He added that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing, saying some of the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of broken buildings.
Nugroho said the number of wounded and damages could be greater along the coastal region of Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, 300km (0 km) north of Palu.
In Donggala, Nugroho noted that communication "has been completely paralyzed and no information has been received".
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said, adding that staff and volunteers are reaching affected areas.
"Even in this state, it's a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Despite authorities saying the waves were coming during the warning, the agency received extensive criticism on Saturday that the tsunami did not report hitting Palu.
On social media, amateur camera footage shows a man upstairs in a building screaming furiously to warn people about the approaching tsunami on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the beach, putting buildings and vehicles in front of it.
Reuters couldn't verify the camera footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami made it difficult for authorities to co-ordinate rescue efforts, causing a massive power outage around Palu.
According to authorities, the military has started sending cargo planes carrying aid from Jakarta and other cities, but those who have been evacuated are still badly in need of food and other basic needs.
The city's airport is reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
In Indonesia, the Tsunami Balance exceeded 800.
It's too bad.
According to Mr. Doseba's statement, World Vision's team in Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, crossing the scene of destruction along the way, and the workers are staying in tarp tents in the garden of their offices.
"They told me they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," Doseba said.
It's too bad.
Even if aid groups make a relentless effort to launch disaster relief efforts, there are complaints that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise are prevented from going to Palu.
According to regulations in Indonesia, money, supplies and human aid from abroad can only flow if a disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
This ad hasn't been made yet.
"This is still a disaster at the level of the region," said the Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Arriani.
"Okay, this is a national disaster," the government said, "we can be open to international assistance, but there is no such status yet."
After Friday's earthquake and tsunami, on the second night in Palu, families and relatives of missing persons still hope that their loved ones may be miracles that disrupt the unpleasant stories of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue teams pulled out a woman trapped under a pile of rocks from the flood for two days, along with her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, Gendon Subandono, was running two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
According to Mr. Mandagi, the rest of those trapped at Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
He said, "I'm taking on my own emotional burden as a veteran in the paragliding field."
Gendon explained how he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu contestants who attended the beach festival during the hours of news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel between the paragliding community.
Instead of a double blue sign of approval, however, their message remained a gray sign of approval.
"I think that means the messages aren't transmitting," he said.
The thieves received $26,750 U.S. in the ATM loading process at Newport on the Levee.
According to a report by the Newport Police Department on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who filled an ATM at Newport on the Levee.
In the news, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported that the driver had emptied the ATM at the entertainment facility and was preparing to load more money.
While the guard was busy, another man stole a bag full of cash to load to an ATM, "run after a Brian employee."
According to the report, witnesses said there were multiple suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved.
Those with information on their identities need to contact Newport PD on phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapist changes his name to Ye
The rapper, Kanye West, changes his name to Ye.
He announced this change on Twitter on Saturday, saying: "The person officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been using the Ye malas for some time now, and that's what he named his eighth album, released in June.
The change was made before being on Saturday Night Live, which was expected to introduce his new album, Yandhi.
According to the program producer, he's replacing Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for emotional reasons.
West said that the word was not only short for the current professional name, but also for himself in a religious sense.
When West was talking to the radio host Big Boy earlier this year about the name of his album, he said, "I think 'ye' means the most used word for the Bible and 'you' in the Bible."
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The only thing that means that Kanye is the better, the worse, our confusion, has turned into Ye, a reflection of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's just one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs had various aliases, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, who used to work with West, uses his name as either hyphenized or hyphenized or capitalized or lowercase.
Mexican AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, swore that the country would never use military force against civilians when it approached the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obador pledged Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza that "he would never take advantage of military power to keep the Mexican people under pressure".
On October 2, 1968, military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people during a time when left-wing student movements took root in South America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly aid to students and opening up more free state universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the AI funds.
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence practitioner who used to work at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said the United States should double its spending on research in this area, as China has increasingly increased its effectiveness in artificial intelligence.
After the United States announced artificial intelligence from various public institutions, comments came that the United States does not even have an official artificial intelligence strategy in general.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to become number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"When all other countries are far behind the United States and we're looking for the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence, it would be a good start to double the artificial intelligence research budget," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that double funding would double the probability of the next great AI success in the United States.
"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, one of the most important artificial intelligence companies in China, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.
In the 1980s, Carnegie worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top American Othello (Reverse) player at Mellon University, and then headed the Microsoft Research institution and Google's Chinese branch.
Lee commemorated the U.S. government's earlier technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Association's Robotics Struggle, and asked when the next challenge would be to help identify the next visionary.
Lee said it usually takes a lot of work to get government support in the United States.
"Academic leaders don't get China, companies do," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring intellectuals from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. work on artificial intelligence, Lee said.
"I think people who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should be automatically given a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Ministry published the New Generation AI Development Plan.
Lee said the National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China has funded academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other public institutions distribute to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint A.I. Centre for the participation of partners from the sector and the academy, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee for the Selected AI.
This month, DARPA announced it invested 2 billion USD in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests 100 million USD a year in artificial intelligence research.
On the other hand, there has been no action regarding US legislation that has requested the establishment of the National Security Commission for A.I.
Macedonians vote whether to change the country's name in referendum
In a referendum Sunday, Macedonians voted whether to change its name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia" as a move to resolve the years-long dispute with Greece, which blocked European Union and NATO membership applications.
Greece, a region called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbour's name means a claim on Greece's territory and vetoes its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the new change would damage the ethnic identity of Macedonian Slavs, the majority of the population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about reaching the 50 per cent required for the referendum to hold.
The question on the referendum's ballot is, "Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the price for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after Yugoslavia's disintegration, is worth the price of admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today for the country's future so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, which expresses safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would comply with the vote to finalise the decision.
The change of name requires a majority of two-thirds in parliament.
The state election commission said no violations were reported until 1 p.m.
However, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, 66 per cent of registered voters voted, turnout remained only 16%.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voter in Skopje, the capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and her son Dushko voted in Macedonia to change the country's name and pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, in front of parliament in Skopje, was preparing a small scene and lifting chairs in front of tents set up by boycotting the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have honor.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to other options such as China and Russia and join Eurasian integration."
NATO membership will bring much needed investments to Macedonia, which has a higher unemployment rate than 20 per cent, Prime Minister Zaev says.
"I believe that a large majority will vote positively because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are pro-EU and NATO," Zaev said after using the vote.
He said "yes" would be a "sure our future."
Last Monday, a poll by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies suggested that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters would participate in a referendum (under the necessary turnout).
In another Macedonian poll conducted by Telma TV, 57 per cent said they plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of these said you'd say yes.
In order for the referendum to succeed, turnout has to reach 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum will be the first serious blow the pro-Western government has taken to its policy since it took office in May of last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes the entire Brighton defense and scores.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling disbanded Brighton's defense on Saturday, when Manchester City won 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero was able to make his goal look funny in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine striker scored a midfield pass.
After running through three Brighton defenders, he reached the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
First he went after a defender, then he left a few more on the edge of the Brighton penal court.
Then he sent a pass to his left and found Sterling.
The British striker returned the ball to Aguero with his first touch on the penalty field, and Aguero took down Brighton goalie Mathew Ryan, with his right foot on the right side of the castle.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems at his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing with him for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at the time."
But Sterling was the first to gain the upper hand in the Premier League fight against the Sky Blues.
That goal came in at 29 minutes.
Aguero met the ball at Brighton Field in that game.
He threw a nice ball at Leroy Sane on the left flank.
Sane made a few touches before he led Sterling to the far post.
Sky Blue's forward sent the ball to the nets before it slipped off the field.
City will compete with Hoffeheim on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 p.m.
Scherzer plans to break the game against the Rockies.
With the Nationals' farewell to the qualifiers, there's not much left to push for a new beginning.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to sweep the field against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, if there's still a chance for Rockies to win more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in West NL.
With 5-2 wins against the Nationals, Rockies has at least strengthened his right to participate, but he's still trying to win the first-league championship.
"Even if we have no purpose, we can do our best here in Denver, knowing that the overwhelming atmosphere and the rival team will play at the highest level I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but in such a case, it is reported that Scherzer may be allowed to take the shot.
Scherzer, who's about to start his 34th day, has a warm-up practice on Thursday, and he's gonna pitch at his regular spot on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed player averages 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts during 2202/3 hits this season.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia.
Speaking of the importance of Republican turnout, the president referred indirectly to the situation in which Supreme Court candidate Kavanaugh was facing.
"Everything we do is in danger in November.
One of the most important choices of our lives is five weeks away.
It's very, very big. I'm not running, but I'm actually running, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
"You see this horrible radical Democratic group, you see what's happening now.
They're determined to take back power by every means necessary, their cruelty, their grossness.
They don't care who they hurt to get power and control, who they're going to step on, and that's why they want power and control, but we're not going to give it to them."
He said the Democrats adopted the mission "resistance and obstruction".
"You've seen this for the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as angry and ruthless, disgusting and lying.
When he named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking judge of the Senate Judges Committee, higher boos than the crowd.
"Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Ah, ah, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one.
The Business Party is no longer a free thinking platform.
There is no tolerance for those who speak their opinion.
I'm not surprised when the Momentum activists at my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I'm the last person to be told that we're not welcome because we've given our opinions among the Labour MPs.
My parliamentary friend Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she was determined to take a stand against anti-Semitics.
In my case, the censorship motion was criticizing me for having a disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
A responsible economic policy, national security, the importance of Europe, similar issues that Jeremy had a disagreement with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labor meeting on Friday, it said, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of my eight years as a local parliamentary member of the Labour Party were exactly like this Friday night GC meetings.
Unfortunately, today, it's not the style of many meetings, and even if there was before, the promise of a "kinder" policy has long been forgotten.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party has not tolerated different views and has been judged on whether each idea will be accepted by the party's leadership.
This came out shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my friends, whom I thought I had a similar political view before, asked me to do a U-turn on matters like national security or the EU common market, and to take a stance that I would never accept.
Every time I speak in public (it really doesn't matter), I get a series of insults that call for decommissioning on social media, condemning the centre's policies and telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
I know I'm luckier than some of my friends because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I respect and admire the professionality and determination of my friends who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day and never pull themselves back.
One of the saddest things about this political era is how the levels of insult are normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn suggested last week that Labour should feed a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer that platform of free thought, and with every "insecurity" motion or amendment of election rules, the party is narrowing down.
In the last two years, I've had a lot of advice not to get mixed up in beef, keep my voice down, and then everything will be fine.
But that's not why I joined politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student who acted on the failure of the Thatcher government's comprehensive school class, I have worked to offer better public services to those who need it the most as a local councilman or minister.
I never hid my policies, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has ever had any confusion about my political position and the areas where I have been conflicted with the current administration.
All I'm going to say to those who support Friday's motion is that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will harm household economies, businesses and public services, I can't understand the desire to spend so much time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour administration.
But the message I really want to give is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, who are members of the Labour Party and who are not, and I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that you will not stop me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.

Also 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Separation takes first place
Two recent trials may have slightly altered the final outcome, but Ayr was definitely the winner of this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They're at the top of the league right now, and they're the only team of ten that hasn't been beaten.
In the end, the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every right to be pleased, thanks to their excellent defenses as well as their luck.
"So far we've tested our games, and we still haven't been defeated, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Congratulations on leaving, they had better luck than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute essay by Frazier Climo put him on the lead, but with the yellow card that Scottish captain Rory Hughes saw, the Warriors' play was released, so Melrose made the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot caught an untranslated test.
With a penalty, Climo made the point as he entered the middle of the circuit and translated a solo attempt to take the break 17-5.
But Melrose started out well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggot reduced the difference to five points.
Then there was a long pause during Ruaridh Knott's serious injury and stretcher removal, and when the match began again, Ayr opened the gap between a Stafford McDowall trial, translated by Climo.
Also, the captain of the game, Blair Macpherson, saw a yellow card, and Melrose once again used his advantage with an untranslated Bruce Colvine test at the end of a hard push.
However, the home team returned after Struan Hutchinson had seen a yellow card because of his intervention with Climo in the ballless field and MacPherson's touch on the penalty line to ensure victory.
Kyle Rowe picks up the ball after David Armstrong's boxing kick, sends the home team's fifth tester, Gregor Henry, and then Climo, once again, takes the connering shot from the starting line.
Still Game star looks like he's about to step into a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game's star Ford Kieran is getting ready to enter the food industry, and it turns out he's the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in his popular BBC series, which he wrote with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next season of the ninth season would be the final season of the series, and Kiernan apparently began to plan on how to move on with his life after Craiglang ended.
According to official records, the actor appears to be the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The player refused to comment on the issue, but a source reached by the Scottish Sun implied Kiernan was planning to be thrown into Glasgow's "growing restaurant sector".
"The sea is ours": without the coastal shore, Bolivia hopes the court will give us a way back to the Pacific.
Marines are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz equipped with arms.
There's an ocean blue flag flying through public buildings.
All naval bases from Lake Titikaka to Amazon are covered with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to take this right to heal."
The memory of the shoreline lost to Chile in the 19th century in a bloody spring struggle continues to live in the memory of Bolivian people who have no waterfront, and once again the desire to sail into the Pacific Ocean has not been extinguished.
Nowadays, Bolivia's hopes have increased more than ever in recent years, and the country is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which will be held on October 1st after five years of talks.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla used the phrases, "Bolivia is waiting for results with energy, unity and unity and calm and, of course, a positive perspective."
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the ICJ's decision on the big screens. After decades of irregular talks, Bolivia has been forced to negotiate to give Bolivia an independent piece of land for transport to the sea. Bolivians are hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will accept Bolivia's request.
The local charismatic leader of Bolivia, Evo Morales, also relied on Monday's decision. Morales faces a fierce fight for re-election next year.
Morales made a promise at the end of August, "We are so close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
Some analysts, however, say the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favour and that even if it decides in its favor, there will be no serious change.
The UN agency in the Netherlands does not have the authority to give Chile's territory to Bolivia, and said the institution will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
According to the Chilean international law expert Paz Zárate, the ICJ's decision to reach only six months after the final defences were made shows that the case is not "complicated".
Moreover, the talks held over the past four years may have been more against you than supporting Bolivia's motives.
"The issue of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
According to Zárate, Morales' aggressive remarks also exhausted Chileans' last sense of goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will return to the table at a certain point, but from now on it will be very difficult to conduct negotiations.
Neither country has sent ambassadors to each other since 1962.
The former president and Bolivia's representative at The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, denied allegations that the court took the decision at an unusual speed.
Veltzé said Monday would give Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era with Chile" and that it would "end 139 years of conflict with both sides with benefits".
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the sea issue for his political interests.
According to Morales, "Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific Ocean."
"This decision is an opportunity for us to resolve past issues."
North Korea will not release nuclear weapons until it trusts the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has announced that they will never give up nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Ri gave a speech on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to fulfil promises made at the summit in Singapore between leaders of the two countries.
Ri's statements suggest that three months after talks with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting the deadlocked nuclear diplomacy talks.
Ri described the idea that the ongoing sanctions and the US's appeal to the declaration to end the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees only as a "empty dream".
Until Pyongyang takes the important steps of disarmament, Washington is wary of signing the declaration.
Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are widespread doubts that Pyongyang is serious about giving up nuclear weapons as the only way to ensure security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Soon, the newest giant hat collections you'll see in store displays appeared at Paris Fashion Week.
If you want to add bigger hats to your collection or block out the sun completely, it's easy to find the right hats for you now.
The designer Valentino and Thom Browne have introduced incredible types of accessories for the 2019 Spring/Summer collection on the podium, which has also fascinated the names that have determined style trends in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the instagram was ravaged by unusable hats, and the designers of these hats put their dazzling designs on the podium.
One of Valentino's outstanding designs was an exaggerated beige hat, decorated with featherlike details, covering the entire head of the model.
Other large-sized accessories include watermelons decorated with gemstones, a wizard hat, even a pineapple, but of course, these accessories aren't designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne presented another collection of strange masks, and this collection was very suitable for the spirit of coming Halloween.
Most of the colored masks were sewn shut, and the masks reminded me of Hannibal Lecter rather than haute coupure designs.
One of the designs resembled a fully tubed diving equipment with snorkels and sea glasses, while the other reminded me of a melted ice cream cone.
You're lucky to be following the giant fashion trends.
Style experts say these giant hats can soon be in store displays.
The big hats quickly trended with a collection of "La Bombshells", and we saw very large-edged straw hats all the way from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
This brand, behind the unusual hat fashion spread on social media, presented a larger design in his fashion show: the straw beach bag he carried appeared on the runway in a bathing suit almost as large as himself.
The prominent design of the La Riviera 2019 Spring/Summer collection, which Jacquemus set up for Paris Fashion Week, was a case of dark orange with a white leather handle, decorated with tassels on the shelf.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL about these designs: "I expect great hats and beach bags to be in store windows next summer. The designer has made such an impact that it will be very difficult to deny demand for large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are of great importance to citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have an academic background. In 2018, this success was carried out with extraordinary test results supported by sports, art, music and other civil society studies.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), have over 30,000 students in Scotland, are working to provide the best services to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their next education and higher education, for their chosen career and for becoming a citizen of the world.
As educational institutions that can create a special curriculum for students and apply it, modern languages continue to be a popular and necessary lesson in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in the language he understands,
If you speak the native language, you speak the heart."
If we want to connect with people from other countries and establish mutual trust, it is a powerful reminder that we should not rely solely on English.
Based on this year's final exam results, we can see that language courses in independent schools are at the top of the scoreboards with the highest passing grades.
This year, 68% of students taking foreign language courses passed their courses with a high A.
According to data collected from the 74 member schools of RSIS, 72 per cent of students taking Chinese courses, 72 per cent of German fields, 69 per cent of French fields and 63 per cent of Spanish areas passed with A.
This data shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language courses as basic skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Language courses, which are elective courses, are now associated with FeTEMM (Fen Sciences, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and other schools.
A study conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons employers suffered when hiring new employees in empty positions were related to a lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills are becoming more mandatory in preparing young people for their future careers.
Since more employers are required to speak languages for possible jobs, these skills have been key skills in the globalized world.
If a person knows a second language regardless of the career he has chosen, he will have a real advantage in the future because he has the skills he can use for a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from abroad automatically puts more than one language ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, 75% of the more than 4,000 people living in the United Kingdom do not speak enough foreign languages to communicate, and none of the languages, other than French (15%), reach a two-digit number.
Therefore, investing in language education today is of great importance to future children.
Being able to speak more than one language, especially the languages of developing economies, will increase children’s chances of finding a suitable and reasonable job in the future.
The languages taught in schools in Scotland vary.
Certain schools offer more traditional modern language options, while some schools teach languages, such as Chinese or Japanese, that are thought to be important to the United Kingdom in 2020.
Your child may choose a variety of foreign language options taught in independent schools by specialised teachers.
Scottish independent schools aim to provide a teaching environment that will prepare children for the future and provide them with skills for success.
There is no doubt that in today's global work environment, foreign languages continue to be vital to the country's future, and that should be reflected in the real education life.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "national communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer the youth of Scotland this option, diversity and success.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward, Director of the Board of Independent Schools in Scotland.
LeBron will be wearing his Lakers uniform for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait for LeBron James to play the Los Angeles Lakers' first game will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced on Sunday that James will be on the field at the opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll play yet.
Walton said on the Lakers official website that "this time will be more than a minute, less than 48 minutes".
According to a tweet by Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell, James is likely to stay in the field for a limited period of time.
After practice this week, James was asked about the Lakers' six-game pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-season games to prepare for this stage of my career," James said.
Trump's West Virginia rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts his big rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This rally will be the first of the five rallies Trump will hold next week, and there are break points in the program that will be friendly to Trump, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump's vote for approval of the candidate for the opening of the U.S. Supreme Court member body has been suspended. Trump aims to gain public support for the Republican Party, which is facing the risk of losing its superiority in Congress in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled to be held on Saturday (September 29, 2018) at 7:00 p.m. Eastern (US and Canada).
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on the YouTube channel below.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearing on Brett Kavanaugh, whom he nominated for a Supreme Court membership, where sexual assault allegations and the expected approval vote in the Senate have been suspended for a week or so during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of this intense rally programme is to help the Republican Party, which is at risk of defeat in November elections, gain momentum.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign speakers said the five rallies to be held next week were aimed at "the act of volunteers and supporters to protect and expand the superiority of the Republican Party in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Congre's control is so important to the president's agenda that the president will visit as many provinces as possible during the intense campaign," a spokesman for the Trump campaign told Reuters, who refused to give his name.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the rally scheduled to take place tonight at the Wheeling Wesbanco Arena "can attract supporters in Ohio and Pennsylvania states and be in the media in Pittsburgh."
Trump will be visiting the state twice in the last month at a rally on Saturday, and the president of the United States won the 2016 election by a greater percentage than the crack.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate who's left behind in the Republican Party's polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and support Morrisey in the polls," Reuters quoted political scientist Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia as saying.
Ryder Cup 2018: As the US team approaches the single match on Sunday, the US team remains determined to keep its hopes alive.
The four (foursome) matches, which took place Saturday afternoon after the three one-sided match, gave Ryder Cup a boost.
The constant transition of momentum from one team to another during the competition is a completely made-up sports concept, but athletes believe in it from the heart, especially in games like this.
And who does the players think has the momentum right now?
As Jordan Spieth finished the day, he said, "They started six points ahead, and that difference is now down to four, so I can tell you we've gained a little momentum."
Of course, the European team, which is four points ahead and can win another twelve points in the match, ended the day with an advantage.
According to Spieth, Americans feel they're taking the wind behind them, and many factors encourage Americans, especially when Spieth and Justin Thomas are in shape and they both get three points out of four holes.
Spieth set an example for everyone from the beginning to the end.
During Spieth's round, the cries of victory from the throat grew stronger and stronger, and after losing points from both holes with Thomas, Spieth took the crucial putting shot to bring the score to the draw.
The putting shot at the 15th hole, which won the American team, brought the same shouts of joy, which showed that Spieth believed that the American team was still fighting.
"You have to push yourself and think only of your own performance," Spieth said.
Right now, all the players need to think about it.
There's 18 holes left where they can make a difference.
In the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the two most undisputed players of Ryder Cup, who scored more than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's two different but lovely, four of the four holes have scored points and made no mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only two that didn't hit the bull's-eye on Saturday afternoon, and they also avoided bogey hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning, and Friday morning, at the last nine Grandmas.
It's that their performance and energy rush into the crowd, and the power they get from the crowd supports their idea that they're going to win on Sunday, probably as the day ends at Le Golf National, Fleetwood or Molinari will be the most popular players to ensure a potential European victory.
Preferably, both are expected to bring this victory at the same time in different holes.
But it's too early to discuss the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning football games, and Alex Noren.
In the first nine pits, a bogey and two doubles made the Spanish and Swedish player fail to make it to a bad score until the end of the match.
But on Sunday, no one can help change the bad score.
It's a fascinating experience to be able to watch their football and four-way games closely, to see the interaction between couples, to see the advice they give each other or to hide from each other, and to see that strategy can change instantly.
Europe has performed better as a team so far, and has entered the final day by a serious margin, but these four matches have shown that the US team, especially the US team, has not lost its resolve to fight, and the US side has removed doubts.
Europe leads Ryder Cup's final day 10-6
On Saturday, the European team, which finished the football and four-way against the US team 10-6, is taking a huge advantage of Ryder Cup's last day.
The exciting duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, have won two victories against Tiger Woods to score four points at Le Golf National.
Two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team, which aims to win the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, won the series 3-1 against the American team, which failed to hit the target in the morning's football match.
The U.S. has won two games, with more resistance in the match match, but he has not been able to break the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while Molinari became "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, and he was the second couple to score four points in the history of Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the team games, the pale Woods and the American rookie were perfectly prepared to defeat Bryson Dechambeau with a much more effective 5&4.
Woods, who drags him through two games on Saturday, shows occasional bursts of perfection, but so far he's lost 19 of the 29 games in the four-game tournament, and has a seven-game streak.
Justin Rose, who rested for the four ball games in the morning, joined with his partner, Dustin Johnson, and Brooks Koepka, and took 2&1 defeats.
Still, Europe couldn't run things the way it wanted on a nice, airy day in the south of Paris.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three majors, set criteria for Americans on Saturday with two points.
After winning a tough 2&1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in Spain, Poulter and Rory McIlroy lost the first two holes in the four-way game, but they lost 4&3.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only one team is down by four points, but as the winner of the trophy, the Furyk team has to win a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being second best for two days, a counter-attack appears to be far beyond their powers on Sunday.
North Korea says there is no "no way" for a unilateral disarmament without trust.
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that embargos in the country deepened distrust of the United States and that under these conditions, the country would never, in any way, give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the world's annual General Assembly that North Korea received "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, removing nuclear test space and promising not to produce nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Even so, we are not getting its reward from the United States," he added.
"He will not be able to have faith in our national security without any confidence in the United States, and under the circumstances there will be no way for us to single-handedly disarm ourselves first."
Ri's testimony seems important because he has not unilaterally rejected the removal of nuclear weapons as Pyongyang did in the past, while re-explaining familiar North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance against a "strength" approach, which North Korea will be rewarded for taking gradual steps.
Ri pledged to work with the president of the United States and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th at a summit where Trump promised to "reconvene the Korean peninsula", while sending joint statements of Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un at a summit where Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is looking for ways to officially end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington was also resisting calls to loosen difficult international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on the first nuclear removal and raises the level of pressure with sanctions to enforce its objectives. In fact, it opposes the declaration that the war is over," Ri said.
"The perception that productions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that continuing sanctions strengthen our insecurity."
Ri made no mention of a second summit plan to take place between US leader Trump and Kim, which was highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed and added three talks between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months: "If the problem of decontamination was not the United States, but South Korea, the problem of decontamination of the Korean peninsula would not be such a blind knot."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different last year from the UN General Assembly last year when Mr. Satan President Trump said that North Korea's rockets were destined to target the U.S. mainland after Kim called him a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump, who threatened to "extremely destroy North Korea", praised the United Nations this year for having the courage to take steps to disarm Kim, but said there was still a lot of work to be done, and sanctions must continue until North Korea is free from nuclear.
"It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months," Trump said on Wednesday.
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue with violence and without failure until the full, final and confirmed nuclear removal is carried out."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 to stop funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri during the UN General Assembly, then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Hours after leaving Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, North Korea condemned him as suggesting "mafia-like demands".
North Korea has promised to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "reciprocal measures" at a meeting with Moon this month.
Moon said that the "responsible measures" Kim was looking for were Trump's security guarantees in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking enough rest classes.
A new class at Harvard University this year leads all of its students to sleep more to combat the growing macho culture of 'all nighters' studying through caffeine.
When it came to taking care of themselves, one academic found that the students of the world's number one university were unaware of even the most fundamental information.
In the United States, the lesson he believes is the first of his kind was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep therapy at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He received the lesson's inspiration from a speech about the impact of sleep deprivation on his ability to learn.
Professor The Telegraph said, "At the end of the talk, a female student came to me and said, 'Why is this all happening to me now, in my senior year?'"
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me."
This year's first lesson explains to students how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic performance and also improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the general director of health care at the university, said the university decided to open the course after realizing that the students were seriously asleep during the week.
An hour of lessons involves a series of interactive tasks.
One chapter includes a picture of a dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors, and books about how coffee and light impacts and athletic performance are affected by sleep deprivation and how regular sleep will be told about it.
In another chapter, participants are told how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map containing interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know students don't change their behavior immediately.
However, if you have the right to learn how to smoke, we believe that they have the same right to learn," said Prof. Czeisler.
He added that the increasing pressure on modern technology and students, the lack of sleep, is a growing problem, and said that "the pride of working all night" still exists.
To get enough sleep and good quality of sleep to help students cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, even to avoid gaining too much weight, because sleep deprivation makes the students feel hungry all the time while they're putting the brain into hunger mode.
Raymond So, 19, who studied chemical and physical biology from California, took Professor Czeisler's class last year in his first year of school, helped design the course, helped Professor Czeisler.
He said the class opened its eyes and inspired him to create campus awareness.
At the next step, he hopes to ask his undergraduate students to complete a similar lesson before joining competitive institutions.
Professor Czeisler advises the students to set an alarm on the time they're going to wake up, as well as the hour they're going to sleep, and warns them of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that cause the problems of falling asleep by disrupting the daily rhythm from electronic screens and LED lights.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeats Gerrard's men
While Dolly Menga's hit took Steven Gerrard's disorganized team to the 1-0 loss in Livingston, the Rangers suffer another dissipation.
The Ibrox team has been trying to win their first defeat since the 4-1 win of St Johnstone's in February, but Gary Holt's team dropped Gerrard's team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts, subjecting Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the low-spirited Rangers 11 never looked like they'd wake up.
Now as the Rangers fell to sixth place, Livingston rose third, just one goal behind Hibernian.
And it looks like more trouble is on the way for the Rangers after the foreign substance clearly dropped from the far end hit by a side referee Calum Spence and the injury to the referee's head was treated.
Gerrard replaced eight players on his team to get Ayr out of the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, who scored one point last week at Hearts, made no change on Livingston 11 and would be happy to see his solid team breathing down their neck at every opportunity.
Although the Rangers dominated their opponent in the field, Livingston managed to do better with the ball they had.
Menga's first short pass, Scott Pittman, should have scored within the second minute of Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed this big chance.
Later, a deep Keaghan Jacobs free kick found Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate, Alan Lithgow, hit the rear pole.
Even though the Rangers took over, their games seemed to have more hope than faith in the last 30 minutes.
When Steven Lawless and he fought the last 15 minutes of the game, Alfredo Morelos believed that they were definitely getting a penalty, but the referee Steven Thomson didn't listen to the Colombian's objections.
The Rangers managed to send only two of their first rounds to the goal, but former Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly Lassana was not forced to take out the head shot of Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria's calm shot.
Although Livingston's first 34 minutes of play has ruined the game, no one can deny that they won the win with their hard work.
Again, the Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' deep ball.
While Declan Gallagher was sending the ball towards Scott Robinson, who was sending it to Menga for an easy finish, Scott Arfield made no move.
Gerrard took out Ryan Kent and replaced him with Coulibaly, and while the change immediately showed its effect when the winger sent the ball to Morelos, the influential goalie jumped out of Kelly's castle and blocked the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to drag his guests into the game that Lithgow and Halkett had enjoyed playing with the long cannons they sent one after another.
Holt's team could have raised the difference in the final stages of the game, but McGregor stood up to block Jacobs before Lithgow hit a wide head off the corner.
Ranger backup Glenn Middleton fought Jacobs at the end of the game, but the referee Thomson ignored the request, even though he wanted another penalty for his team.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger Sayaci
And now a page from our "Sunday's Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years before today, and the day future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a way to detect and measure radioactivity, which would eventually bring the device known as the Geiger counter with it.
Since then, Geiger Sayaci, one of science's indispensables, has become one of the indispensables of pop culture, as in the film "Bells of Coronado", starring cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who apparently don't seem to be the 1950s.
Man: "What in God's name?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms distributed by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Seriously, now they're definitely exploding!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the name of his invention continues to exist.
The new cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to "see" malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to "see" and kill malicious cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches your immune system to recognize malicious cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from patients and replacing them in the lab.
These cells can "see" the protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and are being re-injected.
The test vaccine presents promising results for patients with cancer at varying levels.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to identify malignant cells saw ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cell from the patients, reassembling it in the lab, providing them with a protein called HER2, which is found in many cancer cells, and re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said, "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
Her2, including breast, uterus, lung and colon cancers, said Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to "teaching" how to take immune cells from patients and target cancer cells has worked in treating some form of leukemia.
After Kanye West came out of SNL in a MAGA hat, Trump Supporter Participated.
It didn't go well for him.
Kanye got booed in the studio after her inconsistencies with US President Donald Trump during the West Saturday Night Live and said he would sit in the presidential office in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, Make America, wearing a Great hat, "Ghost Town", he rant about Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I've talked to a white man many times and they said to me, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I had concerns about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch star Matt Damon starled, and the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony against Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment charges against the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Although it wasn't published, the footage of West's speeches was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by uploading the video.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time backstage because of the hat he wore.
"They bullied me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go on stage with that hat."
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place," said Washington Examiner.
West went on and said, "Would you like to see a swamp?" And he said, "I'm going to put on my Superman cape, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
According to Variety, West's comments were booed at least twice by the audience, and the SNL cast players seemed embarrassed, one person from around the press said, "The whole studio is buried in dead silence."
West, when ex-boyfriend Mac Miller died a few days ago, he was called in at the last minute instead of the singer Ariana Grande, who couldn't make the show.
West surprised a lot of people with his song "I Love Mutt", disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from TPUSA president Candace Turner, a conservative group, with this tweet: "Thanks to one of the bravest souls:
But Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was "no one but him and that was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose not to reward someone who I believe has adopted and distributed the ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his art).
He's a free man.
So are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced that he had changed his name on Twitter, and now he is an "officially known entity as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion, who, of course, was named Prince, a music legend who passed away and became an artist known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington criticises toxic virility
Kit Harrington is known as the warrior Jon Snow character at HBO's fantastic Middle Ages of Thrones, which includes scenes of violence.
But the 31-year-old actor gave harsh criticism about the macho hero cliché, the famous actor said that the introduction of such roles on the screen often makes young men feel compelled to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times cultural crop, Kit said he thought "some things didn't work out" and questioned how to fight #MeToo during the Toxic Manhood Problem.
Kit, who recently married his role partner in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who was 31 years old, said he was considering "deeping" in the way to address this problem.
"I'm thinking deeply about this right now personally. What did we do wrong with masculinity?
From the perspective of this problem we're having right now, what do we teach men wrong as they grow up?"
Kit believes television may have a role in strengthening toxic manhood because of too many masculin characters.
"What was born, what was taught?
What are young men taught on television and on the street that these young ones feel compelled to have certain characteristics of manhood?
I think one of the most important questions of our time is: How can we change it?
Because it's obvious for young men that things have gone wrong."
In his interview, Kit said that after the end of next summer, he would not play in episodes or further episodes of drama characters, and that he was "tired of battlefields and horses".
Kit will play Sam Shepard's Wild West play, re-acted in November, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor had recently announced that the most beautiful thing that Game of Thrones added to him was to meet his wife, Rose.
Kit said, "I met my wife on this show, so in a sense, the show gave me my future family and my next life."
Rose played the girlfriend of the Jon Snow character that Kit starred in the Emmy Award fantastic series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, the virus affected more than 880,000 people in the country.
More than 40,000 new cases reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Unlike the past cases, most of the new cases were reported to have been transmitted through sexual intercourse.
In the past, the HIV virus spread rapidly as a result of infected blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said the number of HIV infected through transfusions has dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people each year.
The HIV virus transmitted through intercourse poses a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality is said to have continued discrimination against LGBT individuals, even though China was dismissed as a criminal in 1997.
Studies estimate that 70% to 90% of men who have sexual relations with men marry women because of the conservative values of the country.
The disease is often transmitted due to the lack of adequate attention during these homosexual relationships.
The Chinese government has pledged to provide general access to HIV medicines as part of its combat efforts from 2003.
Maxine Waters criticised "dangerous lies" and "comployment theories", denying one of her employees had leaked data belonging to Republican senators.
US MP Maxine Waters denied allegations Saturday that one of her employees shared personal information on the Wikipedia pages of three Republican US senators.
The allegations are supported by "extreme right-wing" political commentators and websites, Democratic Party MP Waters said.
"Lies, lies and even lower lies", Waters said on Twitter.
The shared information includes the home address and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
This information about members of Congress was posted on the Internet Thursday by an unidentified person during a Senate group hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address for the source of the shipments was linked to Waters' office and released information from one of Waters' employees.
"These unfounded allegations are completely false and completely false," Waters said.
"My employee, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these false and unfounded allegations, is not in any way responsible for the leak.
These unfounded claims are completely false and completely false."
Waters' statement attracted some people's reactions online, and the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, was among those who expressed their reaction.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer said in his statement.
"It shows that Waters doesn't have the right to be a congressman.
When someone's accused of a crime they didn't commit, he shouldn't get angry.
He must not show any intolerance to critics.
The accuser shouldn't question his intentions.
He needs to be calm and relaxed."
Fleischer compared Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to Waters, who was criticized by the Democrats for appearance of extreme anger at Thursday's session.
On Twitter, Republican Omar Navarro, who ran for Waters' seat in the midterms, voiced his thoughts:
"If it's true, the earth will move."
Waters said in his statement that his office "reported the relevant authorities and police department on these false allegations".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they will answer in front of the law for these dangerous acts that could harm all my employees," Waters said in his statement.
Johnny English reviews Again: Rowan Atkinson's inadequate agent parody
Now it's become a tradition to associate all British-made new films with Brexit, and we can continue this tradition for the Johnny English action comedy parody, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to the white screen in 2011 with Johnny English's Return.
Is our country going to have a new export opportunity?
At least, the incompetent Johnny English character, who points out his exploding eyes and moving gestures, has renewed his license to screw things up once again. In fact, even the name Johnny English shows that the character is an inclusive comedy element developed in terms of film lovers who don't speak English.
Johnny English is an absurd undercover agent inspired by a character who, in spite of his strangely confident and friendly charm, is a bit of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a little bit of London 2012 at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics, was inspired by Chariots of Fire promotional music.
In fact, the role of this undercover agent is inspired by an international mystery traveler, who is now forgotten in Barclaycard TV commercials, played by Atkinson, and ultimately created chaos at the end of everything he's done.
You might run into some funny scenes in this new Johnny English movie.
I liked the scene where Johnny English came close to the helicopter in his medieval battle armor and hit the helicopter fan's helmet and made a sound.
Atkinson's physical comedy skills fill the eyes, but I find the humor element in the film very weak and strangely unnecessary, especially given that "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible have a very confident way of putting comedy material into their scripts.
The sense of humor in the film seems more likely to be intended for children than for adults, and I don't think that Johnny English's strange misfortunes are as creative and thought out as the character of Atkinson's silent film comedy as Bean.
In this series, the issue is that Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cyber criminal infiltrates Britain's top-secret spy network, exposes the identities of all the agents working in the field in England, and terrorizes the night watcher, and unfortunately, we only see Kevin Eldon in this small part of the film, who plays the character of the sentinel agent.
This is the last straw for a stuck-up, self-righteous prime minister whose political popularity has come to an end: Emma Thompson has done her best to revive this character that resembles Theresa May, but the script does not offer a text that can be studied and developed.
The prime minister's intelligence advisers tell the prime minister that all active agents have been identified and that he has to assign a retired agent to do so.
And this retired agent is Johnny English, who, after retiring, teaches at a school where rich students are teaching, and also teaches how to become an off-the-book secret agent: these scenes where English founded a School of Rock spy academy, there were some funny jokes.
English is on his way to Whitehall Palace for an emergency briefing, and he's reuniting with Ben Miller's former altruistic assistant Bough.
Bough is married to a submarine officer, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays Bough's wife, has been a little wasted in this role.
The two, known in Her Majesty's Secret Service as a terrible mess, are back on the adventure, and they meet the beautiful femme fatale character Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister is under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problem: this evil character, Jason Volta, is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventures of absurd fun: they dress up as waiters and start fires in a luxury French restaurant, causing chaos while trying to sneak on Volta's luxury yacht. English causes total chaos to learn the plans for Volta's home.
All of these events connect to a point at the end of the script, but the film has a sense of humor in children's television shows, no matter how charming and hilarious it is.
Jokes are pretty mediocre.
I couldn't help but think, like in the other Johnny English movies, that the British film industry can't really give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
Labour rejects allegations that Britain has developed a plan to start working four days a week and charge five days a week
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to develop a radical plan involving employees working four days a week, with no cuts in their salaries.
Rumor has it that the company wants its bosses to extend the week's holiday one more day and benefit workers from the savings acquired through artificial intelligence.
According to the plan, employees will receive the same fee, which will be three days of the week's vacation.
Sources said the idea "fits" the party's economic agenda and its plans to direct the country to useful policies for workers.
The British Unions Congress also supports the offer to work four days a week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
"A policy review is expected by the end of the year.
This is not a plan that could happen overnight, but the idea of working four days a week is in line with the party's policy of balancing the economy in favour of workers and the general industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to suggest this idea. The Green Party has pledged to work four days a week in the 2017 general election campaign.
This request, however, is not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
"The working plan for four days a week is not among the party's policies and is currently not evaluated by the party," a Labour spokesman said.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell detailed his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party conference last week.
McDonnell said he is determined to get power back from "unidentified executives" and "ranters" in public services companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that the current shareholders of the water companies will not be able to get their share of the company back, as the Labour Party government can make "cuts" if it is concluded that corruption has been made.
McDonnell also confirmed plans for workers to take part in the management boards of the company. The Shadow Chancellor plans to create comprehensive Property Funds so that private sector companies can hand over 10% of their own capital to employees. Ten per cent means a 500-year deposit at most.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy announced on "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation would not change their minds about Kavanaugh.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has led to a delay in the final vote for the judge's nomination for Supreme Court membership by at least a week, which raises the question whether Republican senators will withdraw their support because of the findings in the FBI report.
In Sunday's "60 Minutes" interview, reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible to find out if they could change their minds in the FBI investigation.
Kennedy seemed more open to changing his mind than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course,
I talked to Judge Kavanaugh on my way to the hearing.
After this bet was made, I called him and I said, "Did you do that?"
Kavanaugh was brave, determined and clear," he said.
On the other hand, Graham seems less likely to change the game.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and I need a very serious accusation to change my mind," Graham said.
Graham addressed Christine Blasey Ford, who made the claim, saying, "Dr. Ford, I don't know what it is, but I do know that Brett has absolutely rejected this claim."
"No one Ford named after can confirm that claim.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think you have anything new to change."
What Is the Global Citizen Festival, and What Has It Done to Decrease Poverty?
New York will host this Saturday's Global Citizen Festival, a music event held every year when very impressive stars perform, and the event's mission is as ambitious as the artists on stage: ending poverty worldwide.
Tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park this year for the seventh Global Citizen Festival, watching the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and increasing awareness of the mission to end extreme poverty by 2030, the main target of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project (Project for Global Poverty), an international pressure group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively struggling with poverty.
If those who wish to attend the concert do not want to pay for the VIP ticket, they must perform certain tasks or "actions" to win a free ticket to the event. These include volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, calling certain people or raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
How successful was the 12 - year Global Citizen Festival to accomplish its goal?
Does giving people free concert tickets really convince people to want to take action, or is there a situation called "clicktivism" that makes people feel like they're really making a difference by signing a petition or tweeting on the Internet?
The Global Citizen movement said its supporters were at 19 million "actions", where many different goals were demanded to be achieved from 2011.
According to the Global Citizen group, these actions contributed to the world leaders' statement of commitments and declarations reaching a total budget of more than $37 billion, and are intended to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group said that 390 commitments and declarations were announced and that at least 10 billion US dollars had already been paid or collected as a result of the actions of supporters.
Global Citizen group estimates that the secured funds have directly affected the lives of about 649 million people worldwide so far.
Among the major organisations in the commitments are the British-based "The Power of Nutrition" association. The association has pledged 35 million dollars to help the country end the malnutrition problem after receiving 4700 tweets from Global Citizen supporters, which aims to "help children grow by fulfilling all their potentials".
At a live concert in April 2018, Tracey Ullman, the envoy of The Power of Nutrition, told viewers: "With the help of the British government, the donors, the national government, and the support of Global Cities like you, we can eliminate a social injustice of malnutrition."
After calling on the British government to take action on improving mother and child feed, the government announced it would finance the Power of Nutrition project and will reach 5 million women and children through feeding interventions.
"Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like every civil rights movement and anti-discrimination movement before us, we will succeed together because we are stronger.
In New York this year, artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will also perform at the event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The Interior Minister said he could use US Navy for a "obluka" to block Russian energy exports
US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said they could use the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy sources from reaching the world markets, including the Middle East, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's Syrian intervention is an excuse to explore new energy markets, but Russia is implementing its operations in Syria on the call of the legitimate government.
"I think the aim of Zinke's intervention in the Middle East is to make energy agreements, such as in Eastern Europe and in the south of Europe," said Zinke.
He also suggested that there are various ways and means to combat it.
"We as the United States have the power to keep the sea roads open because of our Navy, and, if necessary, we can close these roads so that Russian energy doesn't reach the markets," Zinke said.
Ryan Zinke addressed participants at the event in the United States, which described him as the voice of an energy consumer, and was organised by the non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance.
During his speech, Zinke compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran to almost the same situation.
"One of the economic options on our table about Iran and Russia is to pressure them and replace them in terms of energy," Zinke said, describing Russia as a country "successed in one field" with its economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements were based on the mission initiated by the Trump administration to replace Russian natural gas, which is a much cheaper alternative for European consumers, and to increase exports of liquidized natural gas to Europe.
In this mission context, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are working to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into Moscow's "temporary".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project is just an economic project, which will double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres.
The Kremlin says Washington's strong opposition to the project is that there are only economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy cannot be used as a means of applying pressure and consumers should be free to choose the supplier they want," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance attracted the reaction of Germany, which reiterated its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Federation (BDI) -- one of Germany's leading institutions in the industrial field -- called to the United States, demanding that there be no interference in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am deeply uncomfortable with third-party companies interfering with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Federation, following a recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren indicated that she would consider running for President in the 2020 presidential race "Exclusively".
Massachusetts Senate Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that following the inter-election, she would consider running for president "exclusively".
Warren, who attended the city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, confirmed that he would consider running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and correct the corrupt government system, and a woman has to go to the top for that," Warren said in Hill.
"After November 6th, I will consider the presidential nomination thoroughly," Warren said.
Warren, who also commented on President Donald Trump at the city council meeting, said that Trump "has led the country in a wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," he said.
Warren, Trump and Trump have voiced their criticism of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet he shared on Monday, he said, "Of course, the FBI has to investigate before the vote."
Meanwhile, according to a survey released Thursday, most of Warren's supporters do not want him to run in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Centre for Political Studies/Boston Globe, 58% of the "possibility" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support him for running.
The poll showed that the number of people who supported Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy was higher, and the percentage of those who supported Patrick's nomination was 38 per cent, and the percentage of those who opposed his candidacy was 48 per cent.
Among the other prominent Democratic candidates mentioned as candidates in the 2020 presidential election is former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden will officially decide whether to run by January, according to the news at the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentioned Track Palin's PTSD at the Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
Track Palin was arrested Monday night on charges of violence against women
Sarah Palin addressed the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma: "After what my son went through when he returned to his country, I understand better the suffering of post-traumatic stress disorder and injuries brought by our soldiers."
Palin said his son's arrest reflects a "clear fact that has been ignored". "They are returning from the war slightly changed and emotionally hardened. They are coming back wondering if their army comrades, pilots and other members of the army will be respected for the sacrifices they have made for this country," Palin said.
Dan Bennett, a spokesman at the Wasilla Police Centre, announced that Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday on charges of violence against women, attempted to intervene in the report of violence, and carrying a gun while he was drunk.
18 states and Columbia Region support the objection to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia Region support the legal objection to the new US policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims who have escaped gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and Columbia regions in Washington submitted an expert report to the court Friday to support an asylum seeker objecting to new policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been released in the case of Grace Versus Voices, opened in August to appeal federal policy by American Civil Liberties Union.
Grace said her partner and his "sons of violent gang members" were violent against her, but US officials refused to seek asylum on July 20th.
Grace was taken into custody in Texas.
The lawyers who defended Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, the motherland of most of the asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
Along with the new US asylum policy, the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision, which allowed people who escaped domestic violence to apply for asylum, was overturned.
Columbia District Attorney Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "has ignored federal and international laws" with state laws.
"Federal law states that all asylum requests must be decided according to their specific status and circumstances, and such a ban violates that principle," the expert said in his report.
They also argued that the report damages the US economy with no new policy to grant entry to immigrants, and that it is more likely that immigrants will become entrepreneurs and "require necessary labor".
US Justice Minister Jeff Sessions asked judges who handled immigration cases in June not to grant asylum to victims who escaped domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Those who are afraid of being persecuted or persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion may apply for asylum, for which reason they have abandoned their country," Sessions announced on June 11th.
"The policy of containment certainly does not have a purpose to alleviate all the problems that people face every day all over the world. These problems are the same even if they are serious problems."
In Palu, where the death toll has doubled, relief teams are competing with time to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse and worse.
"I feel very nervous.
There's an ambulance coming every minute carrying bodies.
We're running out of fresh water," he said.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes to collect the water - damaged belongings and to recover everything they found.
In the disaster that wounded hundreds of people, hospitals that had been damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 were flooded with wounded.
Some injured, such as Dwi Haris, with broken spines and shoulder fractures, were treated in the garden of Palu Military Hospital, where the wounded were treated in front of the hospital due to the continued severe aftershocks.
Haris wept about his feelings during the violent earthquake in the fifth floor of a hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
Haris and his family came into town to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of bullying using propaganda ads
The official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad praising the mutual advantages of US-Chinese trade in a daily newspaper published in the United States. A week after that, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred to a paid ad published by China Daily last Wednesday at the state's best-selling newspaper Des Moines Register in the state of Iowa. Trump began his statements by accusing China of interfering with parliamentary elections on November 6th. China rejects allegations of intervention.
According to US officials in Reuters, Trump's attempt to intervene in Beijing's US elections shows a new phase in the campaign, launched by Washington to pressure China.
It's common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, but due to the deepening trade war between Beijing and Washington, both countries impose high customs taxes on each other for imports.
According to US experts, China's customs duties aimed at retaliation in the early stages of the trade war were intended to influence exporters in the provinces, such as Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the long-standing former governor of the state of Iowa, exporting agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a column by Des Moines Register for Sunday's edition, Branstad said China "has doubled its tyranny by publishing propaganda ads in the free American media".
Branstad wrote: "The Chinese government uses the principle of freedom of expression and free press traditions that America is firmly committed to by publishing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register to spread its propaganda."
"On the other hand, when you go to a newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you can see that there are only a few newspapers that publish opposing views, and you will not find any literature that accurately reflects the Chinese' different views on the country's difficult economic progress, because the media is under the strict control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
Branstad wrote that "one of China's leading newspapers refused to publish its article", but did not name it.
Analysts Specify that the Kavanaugh Fiasco and Republicans Move Women Voters Away Before Interelection
The Republican Party's leading figures supported and defended High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, while analysts warned that Republicans would react especially to women in the upcoming elections.
People had a very strong feeling about it, and most Republicans have made statements that they want to continue voting.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse Maxwell Institute, has indicated that such statements "can't be undone" during an article published in Hill on Sunday.
Reeher doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's insistence on demanding an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to please angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will remember what happened in the future and in November," D.C. quoted Karine Jean-Pierre, who is the top advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group Move On, as reported in Washington, D.C.
According to Mic, Republican Party members, who form the majority of the Judiciary Committee, chose to continue the nomination process for Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, so activists chanted "The November is coming!" in the corridors of the Senate.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be unusual," said fair political analyst Stu Rothenberg, speaking to a news site.
"People say that enthusiasm and motivation are already high; the idea is true.
But when they don't like the president in the competitive election zones, the motivation of women voters and young voters between 18 and 29 years of age in the suburbs that usually don't vote can increase," he said.
Before Ford's public statement on sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court candidate came to light, analysts suggested that if Republican Party members insisted on approval, they could face the reaction.
"This has become an impassable issue for the Republican Party," NBC News reported.
"It is not just about committee voting, final vote or whether Kavanaugh is a member of the Supreme Court, but also about questions about how Republican Party members handled the issue and how they treated Ford," Guy Cecil, director of the group Priorities USA, who helped the Democratic Party in the elections, told a news channel.
On the other hand, the Americans seem to be split up over who they're going to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and the number of people taking Ford's side is slowly increasing.
According to YouGov's new poll, 41 per cent of respondents firmly or partially believed Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they firmly or partially believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
Also, 38 percent of respondents thought that Kavanaugh was definitely or possibly lying during his testimony, and the proportion of those who used the same expression for Ford was limited to only 30 percent.
According to the Guardian, the FBI began investigating Ford and at least one of the other plaintiffs' allegations after Flake's request, the second plaintiff involved was Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified last week on the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, who was under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17, had been sexually assaulted.
Ramirez claimed Supreme Court candidate Kavanaugh showed him his genitals during a party during which they attended Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor Plans to Start a New Internet Project to Compete With Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is setting up a new start, aiming to compete against firms like Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the tech legend, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to determine where the data will be stored and which people will be able to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that Inrupt's real intention was to "take control of the world", mixed with a joke.
Lee said about the startup, "We had to do this now."
"This is an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows users to create their own "personal online data storage space" or, otherwise known as POD.
This storage area can include contacts lists, calendars, to-do lists, music library and other personal and professional tools.
The application offers a similar experience of using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify from a single browser at the same time.
The unique feature that separates the personal data storage field from other technologies is that it gives the user complete control over which information can be accessed.
The company calls this concept "personal empowerment through data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the basic idea of the establishment of the Inrupt company was to bring together the resources, procedures, and appropriate skills that would help offer Solid to everyone's use.
The company currently employs a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a community of developers and volunteer encoders working on the project under contract.
From this week onwards, tech developers from all over the world can develop their own non-central applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he or his team did not discuss whether to make a change "to Facebook and Google that would turn all business models upside down overnight".
Lee used the phrase, "We don't ask permission from them."
Berners-Lee announced the mission of Inrupt in a post in Median on Saturday: "Providing commercial energy and ecosystems that will help maintain the integrity and quality of the new web system built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee fundamentally changed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been one of the most prominent figures in the web neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute, starting Inrupt.
"I am very optimistic about this new era of Web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: The priest who took the Victoria Cross in World War I was remembered.
100 years later, the only British Church priest who won the Victorian Cross as a combatant in World War I was remembered in his hometown.
On 29 September 1918, Colonel Father Bernard Vann received this engagement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But Vann, who was killed four days later by a sniper, never learned that he was honored by Britain's highest military engagement.
On Saturday, Rushden inaugurated Vann's two grandsons' memorial monument at the Northamptonshire parade.
Vann's grandson, Michael Vann, said that the monument was "a perfect symbol" after 100 years of his grandfather's heroic military engagement.
On September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led a battalion of artillery and machine guns to the Saint-Quentin Canal under the rain of bullets, according to the London Gazette.
Then he quickly ran towards the line of fire, "with great courage" pulled forward the line of fire and walked alone onto a field cannon and knocked down three members of the platoon.
A month after the war ended, Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918.
Michael Vann, 72, commented on his grandfather's actions as a "hero" that I know I'll never reach, but also a humble one.
Michael and his brother, Dr. James Vann, left a wreath after the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann expressed "a great honor to be at the parade" and said that "the courage of a true hero has been proven by many people".
The MMA fans, who stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, met Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine being up all night watching Bellator 206 and not being given the opportunity to watch the main event.
There were 13 fights on the list set in San Jose, six of which were on Main Card, and were broadcast live through Channel 5 throughout the night in the United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom, audiences were shocked at the start of the 6 p.m. Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald match, when suddenly the broadcast went into Peppa Pig cartoons.
Some viewers who didn't sleep all night for the fight weren't happy.
One of the MMA fans described the broadcast as a "bad joke" on Twitter.
"The network had to switch to the cartoon because the content of the broadcast was government regulations for 6:00 a.m.," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator marketing and communications department.
"Yes, 'Peppa the Pig' was published," Schwartz said.
The head of the Bellator company, Scott Coker, said they would work on timelines so that fans in the United Kingdom could watch future publications.
"I think we can probably re-arrange it," Coker said in a statement regarding the change in the broadcast.
"But it's Sunday in England, and it's 6:00 in the morning, and we can't solve this problem until Monday, according to our time, according to England.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the cartoon went on, we got a lot of messages, and some of those messages weren't very friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem because we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't a technical error, it was a matter of regulations.
I promise it won't happen again next time.
We're going to replace six fights like we normally do, and we've come across this problem while we're trying to give MMA fans something better.
It's unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley explained that he felt like a "second-rate person" because of his sexual orientation.
Olympic leaper Tom Daley explained that he felt like a second-rate person because of his sexual orientation, but that feeling gave him the motivation to succeed.
24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize "not everyone is like him" until he started middle school.
Daley told the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, first presented by Lauren Laverne, that his goal of speaking about gay rights was to give others hope.
He added that after becoming a father, he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The main host of the long-term radio show was on leave for several months due to Kirsty Young's illness.
In this program, where guests thought they were trapped on an island and decided to take with them what they wanted, Laverne's first guest was Daley, who said he saw himself below everyone when he was growing up, because "a person's interest in both men and girls is not socially acceptable."
"To this day, these feelings of inadequacy and the feeling of being different from everyone gave me the strength and endurance to succeed."
The athlete said he wanted to prove himself to be "important" in the past, so that people wouldn't be disappointed when they found out about his sexual orientation.
He won two bronze Olympic medals, becoming a well-known LGBT advocate, and called this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to eliminate more gayness as a crime.
Daley said he felt lucky that he didn't have any legal problems because he explained his homosexuality, that he wanted to give others hope, and that's why he made it clear how he felt about it.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man, Dustin Lance Black, an American film producer he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar director 20 years older than him last year, but he says the difference in age is never a problem.
Daley, who first participated in the Olympics when he was 14 years old and lost his father to cancer three years later, said it was difficult to find a peer who had experienced similar ups and downs in life when "he went through so much at a young age".
The couple were happy to adopt a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed since he became a father.
"If you had asked me that question last year, I would have been only interested in getting a gold medal."
But there are more valuable things than gold medals won at the Olympics.
For me, Robbie was the Olympic gold medal."
Daley's son is named after his father Robert, who was diagnosed with brain cancer and died in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley told me that Daley's father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets to the London 2012 Olympics because he wanted to watch the games in the first row.
Daley said, "Dad, you're not gonna live long enough to watch the games in the first row," he said.
Daley explained what happened at the time of his father's death: "I was holding his hand the moment he stopped breathing, and I really couldn't accept that he wasn't invincible until he gave up his last breath and died."
The Olympic athlete competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics a year after his father's death and won a bronze medal.
"I've known all my life that I've dreamed about this: jumping in front of fans of my own country. It doesn't feel any better," Daley said.
Daley's choice was "Proud" by Heather Small, who meant a great deal to him while preparing for the Olympic Games and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 p.m. on Sundays, British Summer Time.
Mickelson dropped out of shape at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
On Sunday, the American Phil Mickelson will win a record in his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he has to regain his form in order for this record to not be a sad turning point.
Mickelson, who won the 12th time at the event every two years, was cast by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's football and four-way (foursome) games.
Mickelson, a five-time major champion, was usually at the center of events on the US team, but he spent Saturday cheering for his team or training in the field hoping to address the problem that caused his performance in the game.
Even at the height of his career, a 48-year-old athlete who doesn't have enough swings is not the ideal choice for the tough Le Golf National course, where the long swings don't go unpunished.
As if the parkour itself wasn't hard enough, Mickelson will compete with British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, winning four out of four of his inexperienced teammates, Tommy Fleetwood, this week.
If the American team is four points behind Sunday's 12 singles, Mickelson's game will certainly be of great importance if he can start quickly.
Furyk said he trusted his teammate, and he couldn't have said anything different.
"Mickelson fully understood his role today, patted me on the back and said he would be ready for tomorrow," the US captain said to his teammate.
"He's too confident.
Mickelson is an actor who signed up for Hall of Fame, a name that's done a lot for the teams he's played in the past and for our team this week.
It wasn't in my head to play him in two games.
I thought you were going to play more games, but it had to be this way, so we decided we had to keep playing.
Of course, Mickelson wants to be on the field like everybody else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for best player at the Ryder Cup.
For Mickelson, this game could mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which he never fully achieved in his individual record.
According to Furyk, Mickelson won 18 games, lost 20 games, and tied seven games.
The team captain said about Mickelson: "He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to joke around with people, he's a really great friend to spend time in the team room."
I think the young players were happy to get a chance to fight him this week, and it was fun to watch.
He's doing more than just play."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that the big difference can soon be closed.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, has experienced that it is easy to enter the singles in the front by a huge margin.
The Danish player played his first game in Valderrama in 1997, and Seve Ballesteros' team was ahead of the Americans by five points, but at the end of the match, they won by a very small nose difference, such as 141/2-131.
After watching the 2018 team win both at Le Golf National on Friday and yesterday at 5-3 and win at Le Golf National with a big 10-6 score, Bjørn (photocraft) made this statement: "I keep reminding myself that we were in front of Valderrama by a huge difference, we were in Brookline by a huge margin, but we lost at Brookline, and we won by a very small margin in Valderrama."
History reminds me and the players of the rival team that nothing is over yet.
We'll play with full performance tomorrow.
We're gonna go out there and do everything we have to do.
The score means nothing's over until it's on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, and we're trying to win this trophy, and that should be our whole focus.
I've been saying the same thing from the beginning, my focus is 12 players on my team, but we all know who we're dealing with on the rival team, and we're dealing with the best players in the world."
"I'm never sure of myself in this game.
Tomorrow is a completely different day.
Tomorrow, individual performances will come forward, and what we have to do will change.
Well, if everything's going well, it feels great to play with your partner, but when you're on the field by yourself, you're tested as a golfer with all your capabilities.
That's the message we need to pass on to the players: tomorrow, bring your best.
You need to break up with your partner, and your partner needs to go out there and perform his best."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, captain of the rival team, he expects his players to perform better than their individual partner match, which does not apply to Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in four games.
Furyk, who had been on the losing side and the winning side of the team's last-minute change of fortune, was on the winning side of Brookline, while Europe's team was defeated at the "The Miracle in Medina" victory.
In 1999, Furyk answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw motivated his players on the last day, using the phrases, "I remember exactly what he said."
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but like Brookline or Medinah, you have to start the game quickly.
Once the momentum is on your side, there's a big job for the players in the field.
So we did our rankings based on this, and we found out about the players that we believe are very high in performance, and you know, tomorrow we're going to try to create a miracle."
Thomas has taken the lead in the first round against Rory McIlroy, and the first half of the European team's list is Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter.
"I chose to play the players I chose in this order because I think this line is right for every game from start to finish," Bjorn said about the players he selected for single matches.
Germany's new warship has been delayed once again.
The German Navy's new frigate would replace the Cold War warships, starting in 2014, but according to local media reports, the frigate will not be operational until next year, due to malfunctioning systems and rising costs.
According to a military source speaking to Die Zeit, the arrival date of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates' flagship "Rheinland-Pfalz" has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the German Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery didn't leave the ambitious project alone.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships the German Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
The ships were reportedly equipped with low-frequency radar, infrared and acoustic signatures, as well as a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles.
Other important features of the ship include longer maintenance intervals, and new frigates are expected to be able to serve for up to two years, away from the port of restraint.
But according to the report of Die Zeit, the latest model warships, said Germany would allow them to deploy their forces overseas, will be obsolete by the time they enter the service.
The F125 frigates, which did not escape misfortunes, were made headlines last year with the German Navy officially refusing to serve the ship and returning it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
The Navy returned the ship that was first delivered with this incident to the ship’s manufacturer.
The reasons for the extradition have not been detailed, however, reports in the German media said that there were a number of critical "print and hardware errors" that would render the ship useless if the ship was launched on a combat mission.
The software errors are particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be used by 120 shipmen, who are half the staff in the former Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, its performance dropped, limiting the ability for marine personnel to alter the ship in the future.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" reportedly weighed twice as much as the ships in similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides defective equipment, the cost of the entire project, including training for staff, has become a problem.
The project price is allegedly up from the start price of 2.2 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 US).
Despite warnings that Germany's power in the seas has decreased, problems in new frigates also become important.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the German Navy's "warrior ships are running low".
Despite former ships being removed from service, the problem has grown over time due to the lack of new ships, the defence committee said.
The president regrets that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates are fit to join the Navy.
The National Trust Association is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats.
There's a new study of how bats benefit from the land during hunting in Highlands, Scotland.
The research hopes that the findings will shed light on the behavior of the only flying mammals, the bats, and guide future conservation efforts.
The work by scientists at Scotland's National Trust for Scotland association will be followed by common dwarf bats and Mediterranean dwarf bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared bats and Daubenton bats.
During the season, special recording devices will be placed at the important points of the land to monitor the activities of the bats.
The NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile studies using holding detectors.
After all the recordings are analyzed by experts, the frequency of the bat sounds will be determined to determine what species is doing.
Later, a habitat map and report will be prepared to create a detailed picture of the behaviour of bats across the land.
NTS nature conservation consultant Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are more important to bats and how they are used by each species of bat.
This information will help to determine the best way to preserve the woodland for bats and related species, as well as to benefit from habitat management, such as the building of grasslands.
In the last century, there has been a significant decline in bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom.
Bats are threatened by construction and construction that affect their perch and cause them to lose their habitat.
Other factors that pose a risk to bats include wind turbines, lighting tools, mosquito nets, chemical procedures used in some building materials, and attacks by house cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But his ears are more useful to catching his prey at night because of his hunting habits.
Bats use an advanced echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles along their flight pathways.
NTS, which is responsible for the protection of 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, puts great emphasis on bats.
The association employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, perch reviews, and sometimes rescue activities.
The organisation established Scotland's first and only shelter for bats in Threeve, home to eight of Scotland's ten different bats.
David Thompson, the manager of the land, said the land was ideal for bats.
"We have a great area for bats in Threave," Thompson said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a nice living space.
But we still don't know much about bats, so our work here and in other areas will help us understand what bats need to develop."
Thompson underscores the need to check whether there are bats in the buildings before they start maintenance. The accidental destruction of a single mother's perch could cause the death of nearly 400 female and baby bats to destroy the entire population.
Bats are protected animals that are forbidden to kill bats, disturb them, or harm them, or destroy their perch.
The Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elisabeth Ferrell, invited people to contribute to the project.
"We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know what populations of many species are living in our region," Ferrell said in his statement.
Ronaldo's attorneys, refusing rape allegations, are preparing to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations "the false news" and claimed that people were using the name Ronaldo to "try to promote themselves".
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing the allegations.
The Portuguese national team and Juventus' striker Ronaldo allegedly raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayonga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Ronaldo allegedly paid her $375,000 not to talk about it later, according to a report in Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking to 142 million followers on Instagram live hours after the allegations were found in the media, 33-year-old Ronaldo said the allegations were "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news."
"They want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, I'm fine," he said with a smile.
Ronaldo's attorneys are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations that they consider the subject of suspicion in the area of privacy to be "inadmissible news".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said he would demand compensation for the football player's "inspired moral damage to the size of this violation, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations ever seen in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a room in the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
According to documents at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the football player's room after meeting at a nightclub, where Ronaldo raped Mayorga.
Mayorga argues Ronaldo kneels down after the alleged incident and tells himself that he's a "good man" at 99 percent of the time and that "one percent" has been betrayed.
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sexual relations, but it was in the consent of the two parties.
Mayorga argues that he went to the police and accepted a non-trial compromise because he was afraid that his injuries would be photographed at the hospital, but he was afraid of "revengement" and "to be humiliated in public".
Mayarga, 34, says he is still suffering from the alleged trauma, so he is looking for ways to break the agreement.
Ronaldo was about to be transferred from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus for 100 million euros.
Brexit: England will always regret losing automobile manufacturers.
Trade Minister Greg Clark said Britain would "always regret" if it lost its world leadership position in the production of a car after Brexit.
He added that it was "anxiety" for Britain to inform the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, they will temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
Clark said, "We need to make a deal."
The Japanese car company said that if Brexit was in a non-contracted situation, the delay in waiting at the border could cause people to lose their jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produced Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced 150,000 vehicles, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union last year.
"My opinion is that if Britain withdraws from the EU by the end of March, production will stop in our factory," Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota's Burnaston factory, said.
Car manufacturers such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover also sparked fear that it would leave the EU without agreeing on how cross-border trade would work.
For example, the BMW said that Brexit would shut down the Mini facility at Oxford for a month.
The main concern is what automobile manufacturers call the risks in the supply chain if Brexit does not have an agreement.
The Toyota production line works with parts from suppliers in Britain and the EU every 37 minutes "just in time" for custom cars.
If Britain withdraws from the EU by March 29th without an agreement, customs could fail. According to industry, this could cause delays, delays, and parts cannot be supplied.
The firm said it was impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory at the Derbyshire facility, so production would stop.
In terms of Theresa May's future relations with the EU, she said the Chequers plan was "clearly set to prevent these border controls".
"We need to make a deal. Like I said, we want to make the best deal that will not only lead us to success for now, but we want to make the best deal that will allow us to get this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"According to evidence from other manufacturers, not just Toyota, "we should definitely be able to maintain our highly successful supply chains."
Toyota failed to determine how long production would last, but in the longer term, it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the facility and eventually put people out of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year Unity meeting planner at Burnaston, said his members were increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, these things never come back when they're gone.
"We need to come up with a clear and reliable plan for future relations with the EU," a government spokesman said.
White House: Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
On Sunday, the White House said Donald Trump's big meeting with Deputy Justice Rod Rosenstein "could be postponed for another week", as arguments continue over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein manages the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's election intervention, the connections between Trump's aides and Russia, and the possibility of the president obstructing justice.
There have been rumors in Washington for months whether Trump would lay off his deputy minister by endangering Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a wire to record his conversations with Trump and the 25th amendment to suspend the president.
Rosenstein denied the story.
But last Monday, however, he went to the White House, amid allegations that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that there would be a meeting Thursday with Trump, who was in New York at the time at the United Nations.
Trump said he had "no choice" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that it wouldn't interfere with the Senate Justice Commission hearing between Kavanaugh and one of the two women who accused him of sexual abuse and applied to his testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, went to Fox News on Sunday.
"A date has not been set for this, it may be this week, but it is possible to postpone another week, given everything else in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always want to keep the press posted on the news."
Some reporters object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press briefing in the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace, the host of the program, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings wasn't because TV reporters "played on the bleachers," but he added: "But I can't deny they played in the stands."
Sanders later suggested that direct contact with Trump and the press would increase.
"Trump organises more questions and answers sessions than any other president before him," he said, adding, without funding, "We have looked at the number of data," he added.
"The briefings will continue, but if the press has a chance to direct their questions about the United States directly to the president, it would be better than having them talk to me.
We try to do this often, and you've seen us do this many times in the last few weeks, and when you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it will replace the press briefing," he said.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions with high-ranking visitors or press conferences.
Solo press conferences don't happen often.
The president has shown perhaps why by speaking too freely in front of reporters gathered in New York this week and occasionally giving strange images.
Minister of Health writes letters to EU employees at Scotland's NHS about Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has sent letters to EU employees at Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and ask them to continue working during the period after Brexit.
Scottish Parliamentary Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government had already pledged to cover the cost of finalised position applications for EU citizens working in the transferred public services.
"The talks on withdrawal between Britain and the EU continued during the summer, and the way for the expected decisions to be taken this fall has been opened.
But the British government also stepped up their preparations in case there was no deal.
I know this is a very difficult time for all of you.
So I wanted to say once again how much I value the contributions of every member of our staff, no matter what nation.
While our colleagues in the EU and outside are strengthening and improving health care work, they also offer valuable experience and skills that benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we would love for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie, who was injured in the head, was rushed to surgery.
According to Mike Organ's report at Tennessean, Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie was rushed to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday after his head injury in a 31-27 loss.
Rod Reed, the head coach at Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury happened shortly before the halftime.
"He came to the edge of the field and collapsed where he was," Reed said.
After giving Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines, trainers and medical personnel put him on a gurney and took him for a detailed examination.
An official at Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/degree of injury yet," and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
He was transferred from Abercrombie Illinois in his second year of college and his second season at Tennessee State.
A total of five ball players played before leaving Saturday's game, the football player raised the number of players in the season to 18.
Higher stamp tax will be received by foreigners who buy real estate in England.
In England, higher stamp tax will be received than foreigners buying real estate, and this surplus will be used for homeless people within their new Tory plans.
This will disable Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
A raise stamp tax will be taken from non-taxers in England
The Ministry of Finance predicts that 120 million pounds a year will be collected to help the homeless
Theresa May is going to announce today that more will be taxed on foreign buyers buying real estate in England to help the homeless.
This move is seen as Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to nullify the success of his attempt to secure a more affordable home by targeting high-income buyers.
The stamp tax hike will be provided by non-taxers and firms in England, which will contribute to the government's efforts to fight homelessness.
This fee, which is added to the current stamp tax, may also include high taxes from the second homes and foreign property two years ago.
The Ministry of Finance predicts that this initiative will yield up to 120 million pounds a year.
It's estimated that 13 percent of the new generation of real estate in London has been bought by people outside of England, which makes it difficult for the first time to buy real estate by raising prices.
Due to foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad, many wealthy areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities".
The new policy came up a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax reduction so that he could get more young people's first homes.
Johnson accused major construction firms of putting them on the property early and then raising real estate prices by not using them, and invited May to remove quotas in affordable homes in England to remove this "property scandal".
Corbyn announced a series of remarkable housing reform proposals, including rent audits, aimed at ending "unsubstantiated" evacuations.
He also wants more authority for the councils to build new houses.
"Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to revitalising the British dream, which is to make life better for all future generations.
Which requires fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people to live here, to work and to build a life.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in England and companies of foreign origin to buy homes here as easily as hardworking British citizens.
It's been a very difficult dream for a lot of people to have a home, and a humiliating situation like homelessness is too real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to lead Scotland."
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "greatest goal" was to coach Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish director enjoys the struggle to re-create the Northeast club, which is three points behind the summit at League One.
After taking St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season, he moved to Light Stadium this summer.
"I wanted to play football in my country.
I bought a baseball cap, that's all."
"But when I was a kid, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father a lot, which has always drawn me to him.
But this opportunity only comes if I succeed in coaching."
Among Sunderland's managers before Ross were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic, who had rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town in the past, said he was not afraid to work behind the radical names of such a large club.
"For me, success is measured only by the answer to the question, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'"
Based on the structure and possibilities at the club, this club is undoubtedly the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get up there, but the only way I can count myself successful here is probably to get the club up there."
Ross, who was a once-in-a-lifetime assistant coach in Dumbarton and worked 15 months on Hearts' coaching staff, is just the third year of his career as coach.
Ross also rescued Alloa from falling and placed her in third place in the league and turned St. Mirren from the brink of falling and promoted him to the top of the league, winning the title of the championship in the following season.
Ross says he felt more comfortable now than Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real turning point," he said about Alloa's time at the beginning.
"I really believe that coaching is the right choice for me rather than playing football.
It might sound weird because I'm good at playing, I'm good at making reasonable money, and I have good times.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot of phases you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through the same thing in terms of work stress and pressure, but coaching makes me feel so good.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and I'm doing that right now, and I'm in the most comfortable place in my entire adult life.

In the summer, the burning heat increased the income of Britain's troubled bars, while the chain pressured the restaurants.
The sales of pubs and bar groups rose by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant revenues dropped 4.8 per cent, according to digital data.
"The constant sunlight and Britain's longer competition at the World Cup meant that July's pub revenues increased by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants were taking a deep hit in June, similar to June.
In June, a 1.8 per cent drop in the business volume of restaurants became even worse in July.
Drinking pubs and bars, with similar ones, have made far more money than restaurants have lost, performing their best by far.
The food - weighted pubs were also damaged by the heat, even though they were not as serious as the restaurant managers.
People seem to only come out for drinks.
Food sales are down three percent this month in the running pubs and bars, while liquor sales are up 6.6%."
"These results continue to be the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factor in the sales of the foreign market.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, especially in addition to the cost pressures of a 4.8 per cent drop in sales compared to the previous year.
The long and hot summer has come at the worst possible time for food-weight enterprises, and time will show whether the warmer weather we see in August will provide a little bit of needed relief."

One of the five kids has a social media account that they keep hidden from their parents.
One study revealed that one out of every five children who started at age 11 had social media accounts that they kept hidden from their parents and teachers.
The study of 20,000 middle school students revealed a positive in their "false Insta" accounts.
This development has raised concerns about sexual sharing
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "mom" account to show their parents.
One of the kids who starts at 11 is opening secret social media accounts from their adults.
The study of 20,000 middle school students, "Fake Insta," a photo-sharing website, Instagram, revealed an increase in their account.
This development has raised concerns about sexual sharing.
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a private account, as well as clean "main" accounts for their parents.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a young man who forced others to rape her.
Research conducted by Digital Awarness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) revealed that 40 per cent of students aged between 11 and 18 were accounted for. Half of these students admitted to having private accounts.
"It is disturbing that so many young people tend to create Internet spaces that their families and teachers will not find them," HMC President Mike Buchanan said.
Eilidh Doyle Scottish will be the voice of the athletes on the board of Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected an independent member of the community's board at the annual meeting of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle, Scotland's most decorated athlete and president, Ian Beattie, saw this as a great opportunity for sports-drivers to benefit from the athlete's ten-year international experience.
"Eilidh has great respect for Scotland, Great Britain and the world athletic community, bringing it to the board of directors will greatly contribute to Scottish athletics," Beattie said.
"I am ready to be the voice of the horses, and I hope I can contribute and direct the Scottish sport," Doyle said.
The American, who won 200m and 400m at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, won four gold medals in total, and is now an expert on the BBC, became unable to walk after his temporary ischemic attack.
"A month ago, I had a stroke today.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that if I get better, if I get better, how much better I'll get, it'll show.
It's been a difficult time, but I've recovered completely, and I've learned to walk again, and today I'm practicing agility!
Thank you for your support messages!"
The breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows split the Internet in two.
The breast pump company, which compared nursing mothers to milking cows, split the Internet in half with its commercial.
Consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous ad from a clip to promote the product, which was said to be "the world's first wearable silent breast pump", which inspired the new pump to show the breast-feeding mothers the freedom it knew.
Four real moms dancing in a barn full of hay, singing a song with the words, "Yes, I milk my own milk, but I don't have a tail," and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't cow boobs, these are my boobs."
And the chorus of the song is, "I'm pumping, pumping, feeding babies, pumping, milking my milk."
However, the commercial shared on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy.
The video, which has been watched 77,000 times and made hundreds of comments, received mixed responses from viewers, and many people said that the video reveals the milk industry's "failures".
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth in order to reproduce, but their offspring are taken away from them a few days after they are born," he wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits perfectly into the breast-feeding bra.
Someone else wrote: "In both the mother and her cub's case, it's quite palpable.
But why shouldn't they be used to advertise breast pumps for mothers whose babies aren't taken away?
Someone else wrote, "It's an ad that's so disconnected from the world."
Some of them defended the ad, and a woman said she thought the song was "funny."
Someone said, "I think it's a very creative idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd take it from this pump.
Pumping milk really made me feel like a cow.
It's kind of a crazy commercial, but I got the message.
It's a very clever product," he wrote.
Another said, "This is mostly a commercial for mothers who feel like cows when they're pumping milk at work or in toilets."
It's not an ad that praises or eats the milk industry."
At the end of the video, all the women are dancing with a breast pump attached to their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is completely silent, no cable, no tubes, and it fits right into the breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, even go out.
"Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and provocative introduction.
We wanted to pump milk and bring out all the challenges of this process, as we made a resemblance between breast-feeding mothers and milk-fed cows, showing the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie Pump's been on the agenda.
At London Fashion Week, a mother with two children took the product to the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
Although monthly border crossings have not changed very much, the number of illegal immigrants has risen rapidly due to their strict speech and policies to make it difficult for the Trump administration to place children next to their sponsors.
Usually sponsors are people who are illegal immigrants themselves, who are afraid of endangering their ability to stay in the country by adopting children.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and adults in the house had to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration officials.
Senior Immigration and Customs Protection Officer Matthew Albence has testified that the agency against Congress has arrested dozens of people who have applied to sponsor underage children.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrests were not registered.
"About 80 per cent of people who are sponsors or sponsors are illegal in this country, and many of them are foreign criminals.
That's why we're not going to let these people go," he said.
In order to see the children's case faster, the shelter workers laid out new rules that require officials to appear in court within a month instead of the standard 60 days after some of them were arrested.
A lot of them will not go to court in person, but will hold a conference call and a plea against the immigration judge in their legal cases.
Those who are not fit to be released will be immediately deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they will experience anxiety and depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say these concerns are increasing in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the child's signs of distress are higher and higher, depending on size.
They also stated that sending children to tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could trigger traumas many of whom have already suffered.
Syrian American, French and Turkish say "invasive forces" must withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Velid Al Muallim called for Syrian refugees to return, even though the war was in its eighth year.
At the same time, Muallim, the Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were found illegally on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "it will be done".
"They must withdraw immediately, without conditions," he told the board.
In Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have been homeless since 2011, he claimed "the war on terror is almost over".
Damascus "will continue this sacred struggle until it clears both terror groups and all illegal foreign beings from all over Syria," he said.
The United States has close to 2,000 military troops in Syria, training with Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs against Bashar Assad and providing intelligence to these troops.
France, a war victim, has more than 1,000 troops in the country.
As for refugees, he said, conditions are good for them to return, and accused "some western countries" of spreading "unnecessary fears" that led refugees to stay away from the country.
"We have called on international communities and humanitarian aid agencies to provide returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a human matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no development assistance for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats said the agreement to create a buffer zone for Idlib, the last major rebel fortress between Russia and Turkey, created the opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented Russian-backed Syrian forces from launching a massive attack in the region of three million people.
However, he stressed that the agreement was "the final dates of net validity" and expressed hope that the military operation, targeting jihadists, including the warriors at the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front, would be "removed".
UN representative Stafford de Mistura wants to organise the first meetings of a new board of government and opposition members to design post-war constitutions for Syria and pave the way for elections.
The referendum put conditions for the Syrian government to join the board and warned against interventions, saying the panel's function should be limited "by studying the provisions of the current constitution".
Why Trump Wins Second Time Selection
According to this logic, Trump will win the new election in 2020, unless liberal audiences are likely to abuse the post as he hoped and lead to the premature end of the scandal presidency.
That would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of all time for the presidency.
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's ratings have doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's ratings have tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 1.7 million viewers four years ago, currently leading cable channels with 3.5 million viewers on the main news nights of The Rachel Maddow Show at MSNBC.
"This is a fire that draws people to itself because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, director of the series of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", who was president of the Capitol after an attack.

Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the plots from Washington can determine Roe v. Wade's future, whether immigrant families will be reunited and the global economy will be.
Staying away from the agenda is the luxury only a very privileged audience can afford.
However, when experts use "detail information" as a source in Bob Woodward's "Fear" book on the panel, it goes beyond being a knowledgeable citizen when you find Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich jacket (an arrogant suit by the Washington Post's definition) and Stormy Daniels's, uh, Trump's description of the herpes about his anatomy for six hours.
I personally can't look at Super Mario the same way again.

When I got to Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 80 degrees outside Kauai's house on the north coast, but he was shut down, recording CNN while MSNBC was watching.

The outside money flows into the White House's most difficult midterm.
It's not surprising that he saw cash flow in the 17th district of Pennsylvania as a result of a vote slip that put two congressmen in the same position.
The newly-organised Pittsburgh suburbia is putting Democratic MP Conor Lamb in the race, who participated in the election last spring in another region.
Lamb is competing against another island, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely conducive to the new 17th region.
In January, maps were redrawed because the Supreme Court ruled that the former territories were set in accordance with the constitution, in accordance with Republican interests.
A race between the Democratic Campaign Congress Commission (the Democratic Campaign Congress Commission (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRC) in the new 17th district was staged.
Lamb became a known name after winning the special election for the 18th District of Pennsylvania in March, followed by many people.
There's been a Republican on this mission for over a decade, and President Trump won the region by 20 points.
Political experts provoked the Democrats a little.
The United States Considers Punishing El Salvador on Support for China
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama already knew Beijing and had a little reaction from Washington.
Trump held an intimate meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and hired a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization's administrative team.
State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said earlier this month that ministry officials have decided to recall US officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to a "decided decision not to recognise Taiwan, which has just been taken".
But the sanctions were only applied to El Salvador, who received 140 million dollars from the United States in 2017 for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The sanctions covering financial aid cuts and targeting visa restrictions would be devastating for the Central American country and high unemployment and homicide rates.
As meetings continued at the ministry, North America and Central America officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development, which was a continuation of a similar meeting last year and seen as an improvement in efforts to prevent immigrants from moving towards the United States.
But by mid-September, senior executives said they wanted the conference to move forward, and they didn't release any sanctions for El Salvador.
As a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting, the diplomats said, Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to speak at the mid-October conference.
The three American representatives returned calmly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without bringing harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
For Bolton, the White House Spokesperson refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by three American officials, two diplomats and agreed to conduct internal negotiations under confidentiality.
These officials' statements were supported by an analyst outside the Palace, who was close to the administration and spoke on a non-disclosure basis.

Another expected development may be that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has filed a report on the possibility that Trump may be obstructing justice, which has some very supportive evidence in the archives.
Mueller's research has been reported to be linked to Trump's campaign against Russia's attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will find himself in this community once again, ready to appear before voters, even a jury of his colleagues.
There are many possibilities, and I'm not suggesting that Trump's decline or his European counterparts are inevitable.

What do we do if Mr. Trump removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, hopeful after the Rapid Vienna collision.
In Spain at the beginning of this month's impressive draw with Villarreal, the Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna in this Thursday's field, and will gain a strong advantage to move up from the G Group of the European League if they leave with a victory over their match with the Austrian team.
Due to the injury to midfielder Graham Dorrans' knee, he did not make it into the field during the season until the 2–2 match with Villarreal, but according to the player, this could be used as a stepping board for bigger jobs.
"This is a good score for us because Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old player.
"We went to the game and left with one point, believing we could achieve a good result.
Maybe we could've gotten a better result, but the draw was probably a fairer one.
In the first half, they were probably better than us, but in the second half, we stepped up and played better.
It's coming up on Thursday, and there's gonna be another big European night.
We hope we get three more points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they got a good result of their last game, but I'm pretty sure we can push them back and get a positive result.
It's been a really tough year with my injuries and the changes the club's been through, but I think our position is really good right now.
Our team is fine, and everyone's really enjoying it; the training is going well.
I hope we keep this up and leave the last season behind and succeed."
Women sleep in fear of retirement
Although the participants in the study had clear ideas about how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to their parents about it.
Almost half of the individuals under Nationwide's investigation have spoken to their wives about long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take any steps to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
You can start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not tell them what you want, you cannot prepare your family for how they will care for you in the future.
Talk to your advisor and family about where and what care you want, because these elections can be an important factor in determining costs.
Talk to your financial adviser: Your adviser can provide you with a solution to cover these costs.
A traditional long-term care insurance policy may be one of your options for long-term care, as long as you have a mixed cash-payment life insurance policy or insuranceing your own fortune.
Complete the legal documents: Resolve legal problems.
Prepare a health power of attorney so that you can choose someone you trust to run your health care services and ensure that employees comply with your wishes when you cannot communicate.
Also, try to appoint a representative who will manage your finances.
You also want to make sure that someone you trust in your financial decisions and your bills are paid when you cannot.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an urgent medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.

A man in Ilfracombe opened fire with a BB gun.
During the night hours, a man walking from the outside was shot several times.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police said it was "a random act", which took place at 2:30 British Summertime.
The victim said she didn't see her attacker.
There's no fatal injury, and the police are gathering statements from witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis occurred in Indonesia
Authorities said Friday that at least 384 people died in Palu, Indonesia due to a violent earthquake and tsunami, and also that the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communications channels, relief workers have yet to hear from Donggala's regentship, the headquarters of the 7.5-strong earthquake in northern Palu.
In the wake of the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, located on the west coast of Sulawesi, and its population in 2017 is estimated to be 379,800.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regent of the Sulawesi island, over 300 km (180 km) along the coastal lane of northwest Sulawesi.
It is estimated that the regentate, an administrative region under a province, had a population of around 299.200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main livelihoods of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal economy.
The nickel mining in the province is also important, but mining is concentrated in Morowali on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Anti-Affected Agency, there have been several tsunamis in Palu and Donggala over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes while killing more than 200 people in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami killed nine people in Donggala.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Fire Circle and has regularly experienced earthquakes.
Here are some serious earthquakes and tsunami disasters over the past few years:
2004: On December 26th, a violent earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in North Sumatra, Indonesia, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing more than half of the people in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, violent earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 earthquake that hit Java, the most crowded island in Indonesia, triggered a tsunami and killed about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on the coast of Sumatra hit one of the Mentawai islands, causing a tsunami approaching 10 metres and dozens of villages were destroyed, nearly 300 people were killed.
2016: A shallow earthquake in Aceh's Pidie Jaya regentship brought to mind the fatal damage to the 2004 earthquake and tsunami, causing destruction and panic.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed because of the collapsed buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes on Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok have killed 500 people, mostly located north of the island.
The earthquake caused thousands of buildings to collapse and thousands of tourists to be stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges
Former governor and vice president of Alaska, Sarah Palin's eldest son, Track Palin, was arrested for assault.
Wasilla, 29, was arrested for domestic violence, interfering with a report on domestic violence, and resisting police charges, according to an Alaskan state police report Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone of a woman who tried to call the police in order to report the alleged charges.
According to the KTU, Palin is currently being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bond.
According to the statement, he said he was "absolutely innocent" when he was asked to plead in court on Saturday.
Palin faces three different Class A misdemeanor charges, and he could be sentenced to up to a year's imprisonment and $250,000's fine.
He also has a Class B charge against him, and as a result, he may be sentenced to one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This isn't Palin's first criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Right now, the Alaska Supreme Court is taking the case.
In January 2016, he was facing charges of domestic violence, interfering with a report on domestic violence, and possession of weapons while under the influence of the same incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched Palin in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 for tying her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami, resulting in thousands of homes being destroyed.
Power and communications channels are currently unavailable, and deaths are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred at the centre of Sulawesi, located in northeast Jakarta, Indonesia.
Videos of the moment of disaster are shared in social media circles.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death sentence for a NYC terrorist attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of eight terrorist attacks in New York City, which has rarely been carried out in the city since 1953.
In October, he allegedly rented a truck from Home Depot to launch an attack on a bicycle road on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway, and ran over pedestrians and cyclists against him in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors need to prove that Saikov killed eight victims "knowingly" and "knowingly" inflicts serious physical damage on people, according to the intent of the New York Southern District report that the death penalty has been demanded.
According to court documents, these two crimes bring with them a possible death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a major federal jury slapped Saipov with a 22-point indictment of violence, destruction of motor vehicles and eight counts of blackmail. Also, this charge is often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime.
Prosecutors said the attack would require "great planning" for the attack, adding that Saipov's action was "tactful, vicious, immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injury and damage; Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco's family and friends were strangled by the law," the report said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since New York's Southern District sentenced him to death.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was charged with the murder of two drug suppliers, but he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In a federal case in New York City, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were last sentenced to death in 1953, while the married couple were accused of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were placed in the electric chair and executed on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Uzbekistan resident Saipov showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police statements, he told investigators he felt good about what he was doing.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by an ISIS video he monitored on his phone to carry out the attack.
According to police testimony, he even wanted to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He said he didn't plead guilty to crimes in a 22-point indictment.
David Patton, a federal defence officer representing Saipov, said the decision was "of course sad".
"We think that the verdict of the defendant to be sentenced to death rather than serving life imprisonment without release will further prolong the trauma for all the people involved in the incident," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Tory MP said NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore today at a Tory conference that he would "move the people's army".
Theresa May's former Ukip leader said that she should lead negotiations with the EU, while politicians should feel pressure from opposing the European Union.
Conservative dissident MP Peter Bone said in the march in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage Brexit hadn't been Secretary, the United Kingdom would "be out by now".
Another anti-Brexit rally in the city has been highlighted by the pro-EU Tories that have been involved, underlining Ms. May's difficulty in consolidating well-connected party members.
Among the Brexit supporters, EU extremists and the attacks from the EU itself, the prime minister is having problems ensuring that party members continue to plan.
They insist on continuing to negotiate with Brussels despite reactions and forcing the EU opponents and Labour to choose between "chaos" with the plan presented.
Mr. Bone said he wanted to evacuate the Chequers House during the Leave Means Leave march in Solihull.
He said that Mr. Farage must be involved in the talks with Brussels and take responsibility.
"If he were responsible for these talks, we would have left the EU by now," he said.
"I'll work for Brexit, but we need to evacuate Chequers."
"We did not give world wars to become servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone denied allegations that the public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote. "The opinion that the British people had changed their minds and wanted to remain in the EU is completely unfounded."
Andrea Jenkyns of Brexit and Tory was also on a march, and she told reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people."
"Chequers is not loved by the public, the opposition will not get the vote, it is not loved by our party and our activists who have led us to the streets.
Please let Chequers go and open your ears."
In her message targeting Miss May, she added: "The prime ministers cannot hold their posts unless they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said politicians should "feel the pressure" on them when they consider betraying the decision in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us and the people and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell you we're not gonna let you do this."
In his message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to make our politicians feel the pressure on the brink of betraying Brexit."
"We are trying to mobilize the people's army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-managing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, EU extremists held a two-hour rally downtown after their march in the city of Birmingham.
After entering the group this weekend, a group of activists waved the flags "The Torys Against Brexit".
Labour member Lord Adonis criticised the Conservatives for being sainted by a party practice at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who told us that they could use all the technology for their IT systems and the smooth borders for Canada, and the unlimited free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a disgrace.
There is no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to do a "deep investigation" on running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, he planned to "make a thorough study of the nomination for president".
The Boston Globe reports that the member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke on Saturday at a town hall west of Massachusetts about his future plans.
Frequently criticising President Donald Trump, Warren will run against Trump's co-chair of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl in November.
Warren was rumored to be running against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was Warren's 36th meeting with participants in the city hall environment since Trump took office.
A participant asked him if he was running for president.
Warren replied that "it is time for women to go to Washington to correct the corrupt government, including a woman at the top of the state".
A man from LSU was arrested for the shooting and killing of Sims.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in connection with the incident at a press conference held at 11:00 Eastern Time.
The police, who released a video of the shooting on Friday, asked citizens to help identify a man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot to death early Friday near the campus of South University.
"It appears Wayne Sims was shot in the head," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, 247sports reported.
It was reported that Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson admitted to being at the scene of his interrogation, carrying a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Neighborhood Police Department.
Sims, a six-foot 6-inch boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds in a total of 32 games in the top five last season.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton, by order of the team, is running for world championship after leaving Sebastian Vettel behind.
As soon as Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton in the race on Saturday, Mercedes's team orders were found to play a major role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the pole position, holding position in the first two laps, forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel, who first entered the pit stop, then left Hamilton behind, which could have been the move that ended the race.
In the next round, the Mercedes team entering the pit stop came behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a close-up of the two who forced the Ferrari driver to defend on the third turn, allowing him to leave the interior, even if he didn't want to.
Max Verstappen, who began the race in the back row and celebrated his 21st birthday, made it to seventh at the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race at the expense of burning his tyres to cross the fourth-ranked Kimi Raikkonen.
Verstappen entered the pit stop in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight laps, he couldn't increase his speed, and Raikkonen didn't lose fourth place.
"It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two rows," he said.
Body Language Was Real Bad
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who said at his rally on Saturday that Christine Blasey Ford had not leaked a letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said that what happened in the Senate made it clear that people were seen as "bad and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that's happened in the Senate in the last few days is that we see people who are angry, angry, evil and dishonest," Trump said.
You're looking at the information that was published and leaked, but they said, "I didn't do it.
It wasn't me."
"Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked information?
And don't forget the woman's answer.
No, no, no.
I didn't leak it," he says.
Wait a minute.
We leaked it? We didn't leak it."
Feinstein received a letter from Ford in July, detailing the allegations of sexual harassment against Kavanaugh, which was leaked to the press in September, but Feinstein denied that his office was the source of the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations and I didn't leak his story," The Hill reported to the committee.
"Dr. Fort asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret as he asked."
Still, this denial, from what he said at his rally on Saturday night, was unsatisfied by the president's statement: "I'll tell you what, his body language was really bad.
Maybe it didn't leak, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
He continues to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual abuse by three women, saying the Democrats are using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They're determined to try anything to regain power."
"You see what evil they do to gain power and control, and they don't care who they hurt or who they crush," Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored the Giants two goals against Dundee.
Dundee Stars won the 5-3 match at Dundee on Saturday, making up for Friday's Elite League defeat.
The Giants won two zeroes at the start of the match with the goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team to the draw, but Dwyer's goal put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored again for Dundee, but Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals determined the outcome of the match.
The game in Belfast was the third Elite League defeat of the season for the students of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2–1 after he lost on Friday.
This was the fourth match of the two teams this season, and the Giants won the last three games.
Dwyer's first goal came at 3:35, in the fourth minute of the match, from Kendall McFaull's assist, and four minutes later, David Rutherford's assisted Beauvillier to two.
In the first busy period, Sullivan scored the home team's goal at 13:10, then Matt Marquardt scored Cownie's goal at 3:16 p.m.
At the end of the first period, Dwyer scored the second goal of the night and led the Giants into the lead.
The home team pulled itself together and scored Bouchard's 27:37 again.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces at the end of the second period to lead Nielsen against Dundee for the first time and scored the final goal in the final period.
The Giants, who lost four out of the last five games, will host Milton Keynes next Friday on his own field.
Air Traffic Controler Died To Get Hundreds of Passengers On The Plane To Escape Earthquake
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller is known as a hero after losing his life while a plane carrying hundreds of people safely leaves the track.
More than 800 people died in a major earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks continue in the region, and many people are still waiting to be rescued under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their own lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Guanawan Agung refused to leave his post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport in the earthquake.
He stayed in the tower to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, was safely launched.
Then he jumped off the tower thinking the traffic control tower had collapsed.
Then he died in the hospital where he was taken.
According to Australia's ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesian spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
"We have prepared a helicopter to transport our colleague to a larger hospital in another city than the Balikpapan in Kalimantan."
"Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu."
"We were very upset to hear this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the country's disaster-fighting agency said access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited. Authorities are concerned that the death toll could rise to thousands.
"We think that the death toll could increase because there are still many people under the wreckage," said Sutovo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the institution.
The waves reaching up to 20 feet destroyed Palu, and there will be a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft transport medical supplies and supplies to the area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, spoke to Sky News: "An ambulance brings new bodies every minute.
Clean water is very hard to find.
Minimarts are looting everywhere."
"As the Indonesian Red Cross, we are competing with time to help those who survive the Indonesian Red Cross, but we don't know what we're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
In CNN's report, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the army with the following words: "I want you to work day and night to complete all duties related to probation.
Are you ready to do this?"
Indonesia was shaken by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people in Lombok earlier this year.
Air Niugini reports a man missing after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline, which runs the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, announced that 47 passengers and crew left the sinking plane safely, but one person was missing.
Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, no male passenger was found.
The airline has reported that it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find this passenger.
The airline has yet to answer any further questions about the passenger's age or nationality.
The boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew on the plane that crashed while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers were kept in the hospital for observation on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
The cause of the accident remains unclear as to how the events took place in order.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed at the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claimed the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was approaching the runway too low.
Jaynes added, "That's a very good thing."
Jaynes said he and the others managed to make their way to the emergency exits of the plane that sank into the water at the waistline.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and got a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to improve a nearby pier helped rescue people using an inflatable boat to transport them to shore before the plane sank to about 30 metres (100 fut) in the water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents in PNG registered airlines over the past 20 years, but Air Niugini has no history of accidents.
The analyst revealed the time stream of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution presented their evidence on Saturday at the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
US Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, gathered her movements the night she died.
According to a report by Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that Tellis received his cell phone information to show that he was with Chambers the night she died.
When the data showed that he was with Tellis friend Michael Sanford, when his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers', the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors reminded him that Tellis was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford continued, "The defendant is lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was Tellis saying he'd known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records show that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that since Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, "He's erased her from her life."
The defendant is scheduled to begin closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said the case was expected to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
This hip hop trio wants to change the negative perception of the species by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol's debut, The High Breed, claims that hip hop is away from the origins of political messages and dealing with social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently become popular in England through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York nanny is suing for a double "racist" message she's working for.
A New York nanny is suing him for discrimination and firing him after a message written by the child's mother that accidentally sent him, "another black man."
The couple denies they're being racist and makes the case look like a rip-off.
The mother of two children, Lyndsey Plasco-Flaxman, reported her discomfort when she found out that Giselle Maurice, the new child care provider, was black on her first day in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman sent her husband a text saying, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, "uncomfortably", saying that the nanny was doing a bad job and was waiting for a Filipino nanny.
Miss Maurice was paid a day's pay and then she was sent home in an Uber.
Maurice is suing the couple for dismissal, and he's demanding $350 a day for the six months he's been hired without a contract, and for the six months he's working at home.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," she tells the Post on Friday.
In response to claims that they're double racists, he says it makes sense to finish Maurice's job because they're afraid they can't trust him after offending him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
"We're not racist people," he says.
"But would you hand your children over to someone you've been rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Don't do it."
Plasco sees the case as an effort to "get money", adding that the baby was only born two months ago and that his wife was "in a very difficult situation".
He says, "You're gonna sue someone like that?"
"That's not very nice," adds the investment expert.
The legal process is still under way, but social media is being kicked around because of their dual behavior and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington publishers fear that readers will not be able to relate to a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is very difficult to replace someone who first reads it.
It's fun to see what we know now about Paddington's great success."
Jankel, who worked as a BBC cameraman before an inspiration to write a children's book by a small teddy bear, said he was optimistic about the possibility of rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books after his father's death last year was "tough and sweet".
From Paddington, which he described as a very important member of our family, his father was secretly proud of his success at the end of the book.
"My father was a very quiet man, and he wasn't a braggart about what he did," he said.
"But because Paddington is so real to him, you feel like you have a child who's accomplished something, and even if it's not your success, you're proud of it.
I think that's how my father saw Paddington's success.
Even though it was his invention and his dream, he always gave Paddington his due."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, his daughter was moved to Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, and doctors tried to save her life, but failed.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said, "Nad regularly called me and said that he was really bad and that he wasn't expected to live."
"Then I got a call from Nad saying he was gonna die in two minutes and I had to say good-bye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey."
"We'll be together soon."
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly wore off, leaving her body.
He died a while ago, and now it was all over.
I knew what was gonna happen, and I just had to sit there and wait.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry because I was in a place with family members and a lot of people.
I really needed to hold back."
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is grieving for her daughter, has finally boarded a plane with other passengers, unaware of the challenges she's going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I bowed my head and cried tears from my eyes.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a great deal of sympathy for Nad during the flight.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved him."
Women who lose loved ones put up cards to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are trying to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting up cards on the Welsh bridge with phone numbers for people who might have been called for inspirational messages and support for some time.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, began struggling with depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," Davis says.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son is a promising cook who makes everyone around her smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They used to say his smile spreads joy."
But before he died, he quit because he was in a very bad time.
The first person to realize that Tyler took his own life in 2014 was his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that the chain might have an impact."
He says that the reason Ms. Davis makes the cards is to make people realize that even though she's a friend, there are always people you can talk to.
"Don't be quiet, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davis' for years, lost his wife Mark of 15 years shortly after her mother's death.
"He never told me he was unhappy or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in attitude.
Christmas Day was pretty bad, and when the kids opened their gift bags, he didn't even make eye contact with them."
He said his wife's death was a major trauma to the whole family, but they had to get through it: "He's making a hole in the heart of the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to go on and fight."

The FBI will determine Brett Kavanaugh's fate.
"I think, if an investigation was conducted on a limited scale and time as he wanted, we could reach an agreement," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, saying he was afraid that the committee, which had gone into a stalemate due to partisanism, would have been "disintegrated".
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters ask the FBI to do an investigation?
The whole reason for your reluctance is because of the timing.
Only five weeks until the midterm, and if the Republicans do as they are expected on November 6th, their efforts will be severely damaged to ensure that the person they want is elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been lobbying the senators for some time to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who had been working for him at the White House, his current personal secretary, Ashley.
What happens after we file the FBI report?
There will now be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats fill their seats.
Whether or not Mr. Kavanaugh can reach 50 votes in the Senate is not clear at this time, if he can, Vice President Mike Pence may accept himself to the Supreme Court by breaking the tie.
In Kim's administration, the number of escapes from North Korea was "distant."
According to a South Korean lawmaker, after Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, there were fewer escapes from North Korea to South Korea.
The number of asylum seekers, which was 2,706 in 2011, dropped to 1,127 last year, said Park Byeong-seug, pointing out information from the South's unification ministry.
Mr. Park stated that tightened border controls between North Korea and China and human traffickers demand higher wages are the most important factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made any statements.
The majority of asylum seekers fleeing the North are offered the opportunity to become South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally since the Korean War in 1953.
Many of these are fleeing the country through China, which has the longest borders with North Korea and allows for an easier transition from the heavily protected Unarmed Zone (SB) between the two Koreas.
China sees fugitives as illegal immigrants rather than asylum seekers, often returning them to their country.
Relationships between North and South, which are technically still at war, have improved greatly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the pending nuclear disarmament.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula in June.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticised the United States for not making enough progress in sanctions since.
"If we can't trust the United States, we can't risk national security, and under the circumstances, we can't be the first to do a unilateral disarmament," Mr. Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said she wasn't fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Parliamentary Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "histeric" and said that he was not a nervously qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this statement in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't ignore the fact that if a woman had done the same thing, people would have said 'histeric'," Pelosi said in front of Kavanaugh's statement in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, when they were both young, was moved to reject the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost shouting at time and sometimes not talking about his family and high school years.
He also publicly cursed the Democrats on the committee, considered the charges against him as "a disgusting and planned assassination of a character" organised by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton losing in 2016's presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony was proof that he couldn't serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think with these statements and his attitude towards the Clintons and the Democrats, he reveals his own inadequacy," he said.
Kavanaugh was elected and the Democrats hesitated to answer Pelosi, asked if he would object to the Supreme Court if it provided a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll tell you this, if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not even fit to be in his courtroom, let alone serving in the Supreme Court," he said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that Kavanaugh was concerned as a Democrat because he was seen as a conservative judge regarding the Economic Health Care Act or potential provisions against Roe v. Wade.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said, "A hysteric, prejudiced person shouldn't expect us to go to court and say, "Isn't that great?"
And women should use it.
A righteous criticism, even if it's the raging rage of months and years, can't express it without crying.
45 years later, Mrs. Steinem said to me, "We'll cry when we're angry."
"That's not uncommon, is it?"
"A woman who was a manager somewhere helped me a lot, and she cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique, and when she started crying, you might think, 'I'm sorry I cried with this technique.
I'm angry."
And then it goes on.
I think that's very clever."
Partly because of the misunderstanding, tears appear as an expression of anger.
I remember a very good memory of one of my first jobs: I was crying in an office with a lot of men, an older woman, a cold manager I've always feared, grabbed me by the back of my neck and pulled me down a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They won't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll be happy because they think they can impress you."
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Democratic Congress at the time, worked with her during Gary Hart's presidential nomination.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder realized that there was no obstacle to his discovery of the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't much of a decision," he says 30 years later, laughing at me.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
'The Snow Princess and the Seven Dwarfs,' said someone.
Since he started his campaign late, he was behind in funding, and he swore he wouldn't enter the race until he raised $2 million.
It was a lost war.
He realized that some of his supporters, who gave men $1,000, only gave him 250.
"Do they think I got a discount?"
In a speech he announced that he would not launch an official campaign, his throat was so filled with feelings of frustration and the rage of sexism that had made it so difficult to find money and target voters instead of delegates who supported him.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown," said Mrs. Schroeder when she remembered the press' reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my tombstone.
'She cried? '
How can the U.S.-Chinese trade war benefit Beijing?
The first shots of the trade war between the United States and China were very violent, the war is far from over, but the openness between countries can be useful to Beijing, according to experts in the long term.
Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump issued the first warning by bringing additional taxes to China's most important export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most remarkable tension this week was the introduction of additional customs duties to some products worth a total of $200 billion (150 billion) and, in other words, the taxation of half of the products entering the United States from China.
Peking responded more politely each time, and the last time, he raised five percent of customs taxes on American products worth 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to respond to the United States with the same power, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will soon give up.
Responsibility to Washington requires the fulfillment of demands, but it would be too embarrassing for China's President, Xi Jinping, to simply submit to the United States.
However, experts say, if China plays its cards right, it could be positively affected in the long run by pressures in the trade war with the United States by reducing the commitment of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could lead to economic turmoil in one of the two countries, is far more dangerous than anyone who follows developments had ever anticipated," said Abigail Grace, a researcher at a pool of thought called the New American Security Centre.
"Suriye is 'ready' for asylum seekers to return," said the Foreign Minister.
Syria says it is ready for asylum seekers' voluntary return, and asks for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maualem said the situation in the country has improved.
"The ground is stronger now and our lands safer because of the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists.
Due to unilateral economic measures and terrorism targeting their daily lives and livelihoods, all conditions are available for immigrants to return voluntarily to their country where they have to leave.
The UN estimates more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country due to the war that began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Maualem said the Syrian regime is open to future assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that they would not accept conditional aid and aid from the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe embraces Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European Team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team at the Le Golf National outside France with 16.5 to 10.5.
With this defeat, the United States has had its sixth consecutive defeat in Europe, and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points for defeating the United States and regained the European crown.
For the most part of the tournament, US star Phil Mickelson hit the par-3 16th hole in the water and gave the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined on all laps and became one of four players, 5-0-0, since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest ranking player on the European team.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest ranking player, won 2-1 against British Ian Poulter, who may never enter the Ryder Cup again.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, who participated in the Ryder Cup eight times, won most of all in Europe with 25.5 career points.
"Normally, I don't cry, but I can't stand it today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful that Thomas chose me and that he believed in me.
I'm very, very happy to have the trophy back.
It has something to do with this team, and I'm very happy to be able to help," said Garcia, who was touched after the European victory.
The torch is handed over to John Ram, an American golf legend, Tiger Woods, who defeated 2&1 in Sunday's single game.
"I'm having the incredible pride of defeating the Tiger Woods I grew up watching," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now he has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who came in first place after Jack Nicklaus with 14 grand championships.
During the tournament, the entire U.S. team, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf, struggled to find free passage all weekend.
"I am proud of these men, they fought.
We rocked Europe this morning.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Each of the 12 players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, work with the PGA and Ryder Cup Committee in America, and we're gonna keep moving.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to take off your hat.
They played better than us."
Red Tide News: Groups in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota are shrinking
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Natural Life Commission (FWC) shows a general reduction in Red Tide groups in some parts of Tampa Bay region.
According to the FWC, unsuitable breeding conditions are reported from the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier regions, which explains the smaller groups.
During a breeding period, the Red tide expands from the North Pinellas to the South Lee area for about 130 miles.
Smaller groups can be found about 10 miles off the Hillborough area, but fewer than last week.
The Red Tide was also observed in the Pasco region.
Last week, groups of medium sized groups were observed on the coast and off coast of the Pinellas region, along the coast and off coasts of the small and large groups, off the coast of the Hillsborough region, off the coast and off the coast of the particular and large groups in the Manatee region, off the coast and off coast of the Sarasota region, off the coast of certain and medium-sized groups in the Charlotte region, off the coast and off-shore of the Lee region, and on the coast of the small groups in the Collier region.
Respiratory disturbances continue to be reported from the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts.
Last week, no word of respiratory distress from northwest Florida.
