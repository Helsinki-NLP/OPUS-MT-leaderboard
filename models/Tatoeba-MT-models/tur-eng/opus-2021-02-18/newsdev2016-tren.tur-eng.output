Norway's rakfisk: is this the world's most scented fish?
Five million people in Norway are enjoying the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but in the world.
Could the secret to the success of the country be related to the local appetite for some overscented fish?
Get an expired cheese selection.
Place them in the middle of a dirty, wet stack of football uniforms.
Leave it for a week.
Now you have the smell of rakfisk, one of the great Norwegian flavors that will numb your nose.
I'm in Little Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, great view -- and this smell, it's always hanging in the air.
Rakfisk is a fermented trout that is fermented up to a year, depending on how much you like salted fish in the water, and how much you like scented fish.
When it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians gather here for a festival dedicated to this most fascinating meal.
"You eat this raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter and the so-called "Rakfisk General".
People around us eat little fish cubes and make lots of drinks.
"Some people love aquavit more than rakfisk," he says.
The booze could kill the smell.
I'm trying out a few pieces.
If you can avoid going under your nose, it's not bad -- it's like a sushi slice after a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is a very different product of Norway's famine, when fish were held in water and salt in the autumn waterproof barrels before the refrigerator.
Then, deep in the winter, when fermented, it is taken out — no doubt eaten by a sense of alcohol.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to look for work, mostly emigrated to the United States.
Now the population is expanding rapidly -- more than 13% are immigrants, taken by work abundance, high salaries and a comprehensive care system.
People from Sweden, who are old rivals and recently far richer than Norway, are running for work.
Rakfisk represents something important, a vital part of Norway's past, even if it's a little smelly.
It's one of the most expensive foods you can buy.
But everything is expensive -- you give £9 ($14) per small glass of beer or sandwich.
Norway often does not come to the global news agenda — and most people like it that way.
People here are still reluctant to be referred to as Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who killed 77 men, women and children with guns last year.
Instead, the killing is called the July 22nd incident.
Norwegians find it hard to believe that in peaceful countries one of them would be capable of such cruelty and murder.
Norway's wealth today lies under the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gasoline industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we're so good."
We are, how do you say, a humble people.
His English, like most people here, is perfect.
We're not pretentious, we don't like fancy.
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully -- all of which, except a small percentage of the money from the industry, are being invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone else was throwing out the money they didn't have, during the years of the global financial crisis, he tied the strings of the Norwegian bag tightly.
"We're happy as long as we can ski winter and hike in the summer," Anna says.
"And as you eat rakfisk," he adds, with a relaxed laugh.
I stand in line for something to eat — I've had enough rakfisk.
Now, an elk burger is definitely something else, and it tastes better.
But there's more of that smelly fish in the evening.
One of the few places where I stay at my hotel rakfisk dinner is where guests vote for the best -- and perhaps the most challenging fish in the nose.
There's a live TV link on a bow tie surrounded by Rakfisk plates.
It's like a Eurovision singing contest.
"How many points do you have there for the best fish in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here are our pins, Harvard."
There's applause, there's laughter.
A man falls off his chair, maybe under aquavit.
Or maybe the smell of all these fish.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto faces a tough start
While the new president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to move into office, the BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges and mixed expectations of his people.
The traffic in Mexico is particularly bad right now.
It was a cramped city in the best of times, and since Monday, it's caused chaos on the roads by a steel ring that has interrupted various major routes in the capital.
But the goal was not to stop people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will take over the presidency and take over the nation.
He's facing a difficult task.
In the ongoing Felipe Calderon administration, Mexico had a good economic performance, but the country was under the control of a drug war that killed approximately 60,000 people in six years.
Mr. Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama at the Oval Office this week, "My government has a great promise to the Mexican people to reduce violence."
I'm going to introduce a new security strategy that will help us achieve that goal.
Mr. Pena Nieto's previous political experience was the governor of his province in Mexico before he joined forces with the president of the United States.
The crowd surrounding the capital is divided in this growing state, in its old place, about the new leader.
He's an honest man.
For example, the rural town of Valle del Bravo is fondly remembered.
Residents here are credited with its revitalisation of tourism and infrastructure at the resort.
To get to town, you can go through the new highways of Mr. Pena Nieto, a great improvement through the cracks and bumps that have been changed.
The plaques with its name are also hanging outside the modern sports centre and the impressive climate change museum.
"We are looking for him to bring the real and lasting change," says state congresswoman Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a friend and political ally of Mr. Pena Nieto's.
Especially in terms of security and economics, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs very much.
After 81 years of unfailing power, PRI fell by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, there was a lot of expectations at the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.
And the opposition refuses to describe the new president as lacking in essence.
An honest man, dedicated to the vision of a great country.
He's a great statesman, and above all, he knows how to listen.
But that's not the idea that most people on the other side of the state have about their former governors.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast could not be sharper with the hardwood streets of Valle del Bravo.
It's a suburb of Mexico City in many ways under highway overpasses.
And the problems in the city are difficult and urban.
This year, the army was called to help fight drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, and violence against women is especially severe.
The bodies of dozens of women killed in the last two years alone were dumped on an empty piece of land near a large waste dump site.
Mr. Pena Nieto, during his governorship, over 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico, much more than the city of Ciudad Juarez, known for the murders of notorious innocent women.
Mr. Pena Nieto's critics say he didn't get close enough to the female murder problem when he was on duty at best.
Worst case, they're accusing him of ignoring his administration.
He's in a typical concrete house in the old neighborhood, and Irina Buendia is trying to fight her tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But his family believes he was killed by his partner.
"When I got to his house, his body looked like it was washed," remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs of a beating, and the rigor mortis had already begun.
When his mother tells the story again, a picture of Mariana looks down the wall, next to a pilgrimage with a single word on it: justice.
But that's exactly what this family said was denied.
State officials treated me like an old gossiper, a troublemaker.
What they want is for people to simply accept what they're saying and shut up.
"But it can't be true, with so many irregularities and shortcomings," he says.
President Pena Nieto comes with heavy responsibilities on Saturday when he receives the sash.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and have promised to give them priority during their new president's office.
PRI Congressman Olvera says on Valle del Bravo, "I hope the governor is as president as he is."
But that's what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
The prosecutors claim Bradley Manning didn't complain about being mean.
Prosecutors are trying to counter Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse.
The trial focuses on when Manning was in military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case closed on the grounds that Manning's imprisonment is harsh.
The soldier in the army is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
Prosecutors tried to point out Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest secret material leak in US history, missed several complaints about allegations of bad conduct during military detention.
While Ft. Meade cross-examined prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein Manning in the pretrial hearing in Maryland, he showed that he did not have any complaints about the abuse of his weekly visits with unit officials as long as he was in custody in Quantico, Virginia for nine months.
The cross-examination of Manning's defense movement to end Manning's case on the grounds that his imprisonment was severe and he was punished enough came one day after Manning testified that he was considering suicide while he was in custody.
The military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 has been charged with stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then released online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning was a source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein examined the forms filled out by the officers after the meeting with Manning in Quantico's military prison, where he was held with an increased prison sentence from June 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning reported that the behavior done by his guards was "excellent" and that the conduct of the entire facility was "very professional".
The forms don't show any complaints of abuse, even though the officers asked Manning about direct behavior, Fein claims.
Manning replied that he expressed verbal concern about matters and that visiting officers talked about their concerns and that they would be directed to them, but they did not record them.
"It's okay", Manning said, and that doesn't mean he didn't say anything.
Judge Commander Denise Lind asked Manning why he didn't complain to the board about the behaviors he had committed months earlier during the January 2011 meeting.
Manning replied that his intention at the meeting was to reduce the "prevention of injury" situation.
The military said they had him in a restricted position under a one-step suicide watch for his protection and for the protection of others.
"I wanted something to know that I was okay, and I wanted to get out of the POI situation... to enjoy a quality of life improved from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for about two months before he was transferred to the military prison in Marine Base Quantico in June 2010.
He said he was thinking about suicide in Kuwait, and he passed out once because of the heat.
He said it was stressful not to let him know what happened to himself and what happened to the outside world.
"My world shrunk to that cage, Camp Purgatory," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
When Manning went to Quantico, he said he spent most of his days alone in a small cell for at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours.
Manning said he only had one bed, blankets, flip-flops, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to move because it was against the rules to sleep and even lie down during the day.
Manning always said he slept with the light from outside his cell.
When he came back at night, the guards said that if he couldn't see his face, they woke him up and brought him back.
Manning's lawyer has officially objected to the behavior of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning moved to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
At the same time, on Friday, a claim he made to Judge Manning on Thursday asked him about being forced to sleep naked one night in his cell in Quantico, forcing him to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners at the morning census.
Manning said he wasn't given a chance to cover himself with a blanket during the count.
In the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he had to remove a blanket that could wrap him under the guard's orders, but no one ordered him to.
On Thursday, Manning told the officer that he was forced to sleep naked the night before, because of his attempt to show him that there was no danger to him.
Manning told the officer that his underwear could hurt himself using a back tire or flip-flops, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were taken from his cell that night.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least consider his experiences in prison and reduce his sentence greatly if he is convicted in a court-martial, which is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said that Manning would plead guilty to lesser crimes and plan to fight the crimes that were too extreme.
The trial was scheduled to continue this weekend, and prosecutors are expected to discuss the guaranteed custody situation.
The Pentagon has stated that Manning is being held in accordance with the rules of all maximum detention prisoners in Quantico.
Those who are involved in the assumptions against Manning are helping the enemy, causing intelligence to be misrepresented on the Internet, passing national defense information, and stealing public property or records.
If he's convicted of all assumptions, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican American identity crisis.
He says a lot of people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity here.
Mexicans tend to condemn those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I barely made it through the crowd to the immigration processing area, and I was stunned.
The markings showed two rows: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), the other for "Extranjeros" ("The Strangers").
I stopped there for a few seconds, I wasn't sure where to go.
Growing up in central California, I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
In this ethnic shorthand, my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian."
Then I decided on the Mexican American.
But that was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's hometown, there was no need for shorthand or hyphenation.
I was simply American.
I speak Spanish, I'm good enough to manage both sides of a conversation in this language.
But I don't have the native words and I can't get rid of my American accent.
That's why I got my U.S. passport and I got in line for Extranjeros.
I thought about it this week when Enrique Pena Nieto, the president of Mexico, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
As always, when the leaders of the two countries meet on the agenda: migration, drugs and trade.
And Pena Nieto was eager to talk about growth in the Mexican economy, which is why Mexicans are now in Mexico as much as trying to get into the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European trade block in North America.
Pena Nieto has sworn that Mexico will continue its war on drug cartels, even though it does not suggest anything specific.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complex and negative.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that the United States occupied Mexico in 1848 and forced their leaders to give up half their land at gunpoint.
But not minutes, but for Mexicans who think for centuries, reminders are everywhere.
So the minute a U.S. official says something a little critical about Mexico, you start to hear complaints in the Mexican press and elites that Americans have violated their neighbor's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's children go to war.
And yet, for Mexico, the really challenging relationship is with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about negative feelings?
There's a lot.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people the country created and people it didn't create.
The only reason a lot of Mexican people live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree, one person, maybe a parent, or a grandmother, has to run out of opportunity in Mexico and go north.
And most of the time, this person fits a profile -- dark skin, less education, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
It's not Mexico.
And even though we're not living the American dream now, we can't miss the fact that it's not Mexico, it's the American dream that we've been living in good schools and found good jobs.
Our identity may sometimes be vague, but our loyalty is clear.
It's the United States.
Besides, we know most of the elite Mexicans in the executive class don't like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They think of us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat, and they look down on us like we're a subgroup that isn't Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is all about failure in their eyes.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now, well-living souls in the United States, but still lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, came to the United States legally when she was a child, reminding me that there was a disagreement between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because the Mexicans held harder on who they were and resented who the Mexicans were.
Despite being a U.S. citizen, he considers himself part of the two countries.
At the same time, most Mexican Americans I know don't feel like they're part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both worlds, but you're not rooted in any of them.
We're considered Americans in Mexico.
We're considered Mexicans in the United States.
Now, as I learned on my journey to complicate the relationship further, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reconnect with Diaspora.
They want to hire Mexican Americans as temporary Mexican ambassadors to show their interest in the United States.
We tell Americans like us what a beautiful country it is to visit and force political leaders to strengthen their ties to Mexico.
Yeah.
That's not gonna happen.
There's a lot of negative feelings.
And with income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, most of us aren't sure that this is a great country.
I'm afraid you guys are on your own.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for their behavior in Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must admit that some Mexican Americans still hold a grudge against family members much sooner than that.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old wars, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas can be an unlikely basis for peace.
Could there be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood spill suggests that such a hope is in vain.
Among the usual arguments about who started it, many buildings were turned to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians and six Israelis, most civilians, were killed, and for the first time missiles from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the great city of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
Although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab spring lifts the pieces up and whether you like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught in a regional turmoil.
Maybe that'll make their fight more bloody than it used to be.
However, there are reasons to think that this could disrupt their fatal dilemma.
Not won, not lost.
At first glance, optimism seems very difficult to justify now.
Although the ceasefire adopted on November 21st continued, this week's war strengthened hawks on both sides.
The Islamist movement, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim that Hamas leaders have forced the Israelis to retreat even though Gaza has been defeated.
Even though they killed some of their leaders and kept 1.7 million of Gaza's people in one of the world's worst and most crowded corners, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Of course, the other part of Hamas, currently ruled by his great rivals in Fatah, is winning the middle Palestinian fight in the West Bank.
Furthermore, Hamas' leaders may conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas made powerful and rich friends.
The resuscitated regional force, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken Hamas's aim, and so has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamics in the Gulf provinces.
The people of Hamas rejoiced that an Islamic hilalin around Israel, led by the Hezbollah military party, increased north from Lebanon, turned towards Syria, where the Islamic slope could overthrow Bashar Assad, and landed in Jordan, where Hamas' allies threatened the king.
Above all, the rise of the Muslim brothers under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, which is by far the most numerous and important among the Arab countries in the southern part of Israel, has changed the balance of the region.
By the fall of 2011, the secular tyrant Husni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years, had little time for Hamas.
On the contrary, Brother Hamas' cousin and leader are more public issues.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can appear as an actor who cannot be stopped even by Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the conservatives of Israel will have the opposite results.
Militaryly, Hamas was put back in his box.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its value, and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep better for a while.
Diplomaticly, America is more determined than ever, and most European countries have blamed Hamas for starting recent violence.
Above all, Israel grew up under Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has barely survived suicide bombers due to the barrier that landed in the wanted province of West Bank, the main part of the Palestinian province, and continued to expand despite international law violations.
Mr. Netanyahu, who joined Avigdor Lieberman's even more pro-war group as the Likud party went to the election on January 22nd, is at ease.
Why should these lying Palestinians be spoiled by giving their own state?
If they really run the West Bank, won't they fire rockets like their citizens did in Gaza?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them when they raise their heads.
Maybe the conservatives will win, but the Arab Spring can change their accounts.
While Islamists gain power in Egypt and other places love Israel very little, their priorities are to deal with the challenges in their homes.
Israel's defense budget is larger than the combination of Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpowers isn't going to help new Arab governments improve their economies.
Pragmatic Mr. Mursi worked with Barack Obama to provide a good-looking truce, and maybe they can start something.
The Israelis must look at the long term.
While the rest of the Arab world is more democratic, depriving Palestinians of autonomy is, like a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week, creating a powder keg that is inevitable to explode in Israeli occupied areas.
Pressure in the Jewish state is already undermining democracy, and demographics are heating up as the Arab population grows.
In every few years, the bloody missions against Gaza will reach a growing diplomatic cost to overthrow Hamas.
He needs outside incentives on both sides.
The answer remains to be declared by the outside world and the reasonable people of this newspaper: the two states where Israel represents the region for security.
A little hope in the short run is that a truce will give a little more pressure to foreigners who are pushing this goal.
Now Egypt, with Turkey and Qatar, which are supposed to start stopping the arms flow to Gaza, is a better place to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, with land exchange and joint Jerusalem.
The foreign Arabs must force Hamas and Fatah to unite.
It's more useful to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming offer of a virtual state at the UN.
Mr. Obama plays a role in bringing Israel to the table.
During the first period, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
He seems reluctant to be let in at the White House.
It's painfully blind.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws of plain packing of cigarettes take effect in Australia
Cigarette warnings and diseased organs are placed in plain green boxes for all tobacco brands
Australia's first laws on smoking and tobacco took effect in the world, leaving brand logos and colors instead of general olive green, pictures of diseased organs and pictures of children and babies who are sick because their parents smoke.
The only difference between packages, except for various health warnings and images, is that brand names, which will be mandatory by Saturday, are printed in the same small font.
It's the strictest regime in the world to pack tobacco.
Australia's federal government says the goal is to get young people off their charms and stop smoking.
It's based on research that shows that if people don't start smoking until they're 26, 99% of the time they'll never start smoking.
"From a very young age, you can see that children understand that tobacco companies are trying to sell through brands," he said, quoting studies that show that children associate their crown logo with the idea of becoming princesses, federal health minister Tanya Plibersek.
Australia has one of the world’s lowest smoking rates, and while the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries consider similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the law.
Tobacco companies said they would support the black market trade and lead to cheaper, more accessible cigarettes.
Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco, Australia, said, "There will be serious undesirable consequences for the law."
The counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring a lot more of these products to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say the law has increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Ptd, a small family company, jumped from almost nothing two months ago when British American Tobacco, British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their challenge to the Australian Supreme Court.
He says Zico sells more than 6,000 to wholesale sales and expects new stock.
It's a good job for us.
Experts say the potential setback is the popularity of social media in a demographic targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banned television commercials and sports sponsorships and asked most vendors to hide cigarettes in plain sight, the tobacco market moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising from local companies and sites, but it can't restrict overseas sites.
Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University, said, "If you are in the tobacco market and there is only this small window to introduce your products, then the place you have to join is online."
Freeman said there was an increase in "central human" reviews on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
What we need to ask is, is it a civilian citizen who really likes Marlboro cigarettes and bothered to make a video, or is a marketing company in it?
British American Tobacco said Australia's industry is more focused on dealing with new rules than marketing.
The industry has advanced to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules, claiming that trade has been unfairly limited, even though none of the countries in the World Trade Organization have significant trade with Australia.
It's possible that a WTO decision will be made in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government is negotiating with other countries who are considering similar package decisions.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to make photos mandatory.
Now it has spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More strict laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Most smokers in Australia are challenging.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm ignoring them.
Victor El Hage said, "Take a cigarette and put it back."
To be honest, there's only one reason I should quit, and that's my little girl.
In Sydney's centre, James Yu, the King of Packages, who runs the tobacco store, said that one type of packaging makes it difficult to stock shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to unload a shipment, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should have banned the whole thing, okay, well, we'd say, "we're done, we'll close the shop," he said, with his hands up.
It's not so bad to get bored in a world that's constantly plugged in.
On this Thanksgiving break, when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane, I spent five unexpected hours at the airport.
So I had a lot of time to think about being bored.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting for a plane for half a day at the airport is quite annoying, even though it's distracting, such as books, magazines, iPhones.
But increasingly, some academics and child development experts praise boredom.
They say it's normal for us and our kids to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go to interesting tangents, and maybe it enhances creativity.
And because most of us are plugged in from one screen to another, we don't experience the benefits of being bored.
So we should embrace boredom?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First of all, I assumed that being bored with more free time, like most people, was a relatively new concept.
Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University in Canada and author of "A Living History" (Yale University Press, 2011) says that is not so.
"There's actually a long history of boredom," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii, there's a Latin graffiti about boredom in the first century.
Then comes the question of how to define boredom.
The problem is that this has been defined and discussed in many different ways, says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues described boredom as "unintentional but satisfying activity".
He said the thing that separates boredom is that the person who's not busy but wants to be.
He said he didn't have the urge to do anything about it.
The core experience of getting bored said, "It's a decomposition of the process of low mode and slow passing of time."
Boredom can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that people who get bored tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, but people in depression see it as themselves.
Sometimes we think we're just bored when we're having trouble concentrating.
Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an old experiment published in September in the magazine Psychological Sciences magazine "Unemployed Mind: Definition of Bored From Interestiveness" where participants listened to a magazine article by a person who reads it.
Some groups have heard a TV show in the next room that is loud and irrelevant, others have heard it very little noticeable at a very low level, but the third group has never heard it.
Those who heard low-level television reported more boredom than the other two groups, they had difficulty concentrating, but they weren't sure why, and they associated the difficulty with the difficulty.
Mark J. Fenske, one of the authors of the study and a neuroscientist at Guelph University in Ontario, said that when you try to focus on a difficult or busy task, the distraction causes distress.
On the other hand, when you read something boring, "like looking at bad cars on a factory tape, it might help you not get bored."
In fact, it can help people to cope by physically making them more physically sober and squirming and scribbling, often viewed as signs of distress.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to be mobile learn more and learn more from children who are forced to remain still," Professor Fenske said.
We all experience adversity at some point, the delay of my flight, a monotonous speaker, a boring film.
But some people tend to be more bored than others.
To help me measure this, researchers developed a "Strength Rate" in the 1980s.
The scale contains questions like, "Most of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous and, "I have a lot of interests, I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, said researchers used such scales to discover that men tend to be more bored than girls, especially when it comes to needing a variety of external urges.
Usually, however, adolescents are a rather lazy group.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment where he communicated seven or eight times a day with about 400 teenagers and his parents via a pager.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers get bored at school and doing homework, but 23 percent get bored when they're not at school.
On the other hand, three percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson now said he didn't know if 21 years from now the percentages of boredom would be higher or lower.
But he said he knew that because the kids and teenagers weren't given too much control over what they wanted to do, he knew that puberty was the peak of boredom.
So I go back to my first question: is it good for a person to get bored?
Sometimes no, because research shows that as a way to reduce it when it's extreme, it can lead to ridiculous physical risks, gambling, or substance abuse.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who has been working on the subject for more than two decades, has said that many philosophers and writers are discussing the connection between boredom and creativity.
Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at N.Y.U., said, "Boring is your brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else."
But the brain doesn't always know the right thing to do.
If you're bored and you're using that energy to play guitar and cook, it'll make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it might make you happy in the short run, but not in the long run.
So when your child gets bored, if you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he won't learn to entertain himself or edit himself, Professor Fenske said.
And he said, "This self-organization transfers from one situation to another."
Your child does not only learn to enjoy himself, but also more self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to be bored.
We shouldn't be so critical.
Instead, our goal should be to stay away from all talk about activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood has joined.
"We frame it as we need to be bored more, but boredom is a desire to be connected to something painful, disturbing, meaningful," he said.
He said what people are really looking for is a way to get off the plug and enjoy free time.
"It is difficult to find ways to be busy when sound is turned off in an environment where we are constantly overly warned," he said.
No Screenplay for New Marijuana Law in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, 19, a local college student and football player in southeast Colorado, faces charges for something that will soon be legal in the state: carrying a few pieces of marijuana and a pipe to drink it.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and his friends were stopped driving along the plains near the Kansas border in Lamar.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a call for small crimes, transport and drug equipment, each with $100 fines, and was given a court date.
"We were treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he like that?
In the uncertain weeks of the Colorado vote to legalise small amounts of marijuana for entertainment, the answer to hundreds of small drug cases depends more on the location than on the law.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases are already being closed here and in the state of Washington, which approves of a similar measure.
Police have stopped charging 21-year-old adults for small-scale transport, which will be legally approved in the coming weeks when the laws are in effect.
However, prosecutors in the more conservative regions of Colorado have vowed to continue their current marijuana cases decisively and are still calling people to court for transport.
At the same time, several towns from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains vote to prevent the opening of new state-licensed retail marijuana stores.
"This thing is growing up so fast, I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of Aurora in eastern Denver.
The regulators in Washington State are scratching their heads.
And they're looking for guidance on how to build a license system for production, manufacturing, distribution and sales, which is due on December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado's first medical use is now in front of most states as to how to organise marijuana for entertainment purposes.
"Colorado has a more regular market, so they will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Drinking Control Board.
But no place or system could do more than suggest what would work, Mr. Smith.
"There is no real example to follow," he said.
Washington's I-502 law will take effect on 6 December, leaving an uncertain year where the state license system doesn't exist yet, but there will be legal transport.
In the meantime, there are tough mechanical questions that need to be solved, as does the state's restrictions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds, or children's day care centers, how it will compensate for its "satisfactory access" directive to licensed marijuana.
"It can't be harder to have a licensed hemp business anywhere than city areas, especially Seattle's big city area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly established research group's Legal Hemp Centre.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his officers in Aurora saying that the city attorney "is about to enter into action immediately" would not sue minor marijuana violations for anyone 21 or above, and that police would stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would set up city laws to organise medical marijuana growers and follow drug trafficking and drug dealers again.
Ken Buck, district attorney in the Weld district of North Colorado, represents a more rigid view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to monitor marijuana transport cases, mostly as a way to force users to be treated.
Currently, 119 people are accused of carrying two ounces or less marijuana, while many face other charges.
Mr. Buck said in a statement, "Our office has a duty to prosecute crimes that are criminal during the time of their lives."
Even in rural Mesa region, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, the answer became complicated.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the region, no longer sue adults for small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but he also decided not to close pending transport cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time following the law until it changes," he said.
55 percent of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, but it would never be easy to bring the fun marijuana into the government and the legal system.
And the controversial reactions in the state have raised a deep dilemma among local authorities about the state's big green experiment.
The Denver lawyer representing marijuana defenders and local spokesman for the Marijuana Law Reform National Organization, Sean McAllister, says it is a "cultural barrier" with district prosecutors.
"They spent a lot of their lives suing people, so they still don't recognize it as legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are ready to be national test cases for legalization of drugs.
Lawyers and state officials are planning a new border for legal sales, while at the same time anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government, which plans to approach marijuana sales and production as a federal crime.
Legalized marijuana lawyers are hoping the Justice Department will withdraw.
Despite high-profile arrests by medical marijuana patients and dealers, the federal government has often allowed medical marijuana businesses in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Former drug policy adviser Kevin A. Sabat, under Obama's administration, said drug agents probably won't punch doors to catch a small drug bag, but it's possible that they'll stop them from allowing the state's entertainment marijuana stores to be held up by new laws.
A few cities in Colorado don't expect federal authorities to take action.
Even before Election Day, some local governments agreed to postpone debt at the new marijuana shops, which are about another year to open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west brought a six-month ban, and it's likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to give someone a license and be put in a position where this is a huge federal problem," city council member Bob Nicholson said.
Our district voted against change.
We're looking at a vote against the state's vote.
That's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was removed from Oxford because I was conservative.
Only today's students are not attacked because of their views.
I can't remember a time when I didn't dream of winning a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother were found in the modern wine red symposium, the best learning place in the world, where two pillars of civilization were encouraged by freedom of thought and tolerance.
But in the two weeks when I took my place at Worcester College to study history in the late '80s, I packed my bags, started the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
Friends are stunned.
The Evening Standard agenda claims I broke up with my undergraduate friends in the room next to me because I objected to having sex.
Writer A N Wilson announced that I left because I was forced to drink from a broken cup with a sense of humor.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was faced with systematic bullying and intimidation.
It's not because of my name that's a little weird or because I'm coming from private school.
I was only tried for one reason, and in the cradle of so-called enlightenment, this was both old-fashioned and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was Margaret Thatcher's high-profile advisor, and I was supporting the Conservatives.
You may ask why I brought that up.
According to recent reports, the new generation of right-centered students suffer from similar trials.
In Oxford, conservative students are so institutionalized and growing in hatred that last week a group of homosexuals demanded equal rights with disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's third-class joint chamber (JCR) claimed that because of their political views, "they were left alone in a tight spot, they were attacked personally and felt undesirable".
They want to create a broadcast on the university's equal opportunity committee so that their views can be published freely.
The new BBC Two documentary did not help the situation in Wonderland: it made student politics seem strange and neo-Nazi.
The University of Oxford Conservatives Association (OUCA) saw Joe Cooke, a former president, traveling with Rolls-Royce in a silver suit and silver-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "the goat of sin" for higher education fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Conservative Union of Nottingham University, told a Sunday newspaper that there was "a growing left wing discrimination in universities".
"Before we met, people thought we were like the Bullingdon Club."
In Corpus Christi, a history student, Samuel Roberts, who recommends the move for better protection, says that such an environment is "uncomfortable", but Stephanie Cherill, 19, the president of the OUCA, says that there is a disruption in their attitude towards the right-based people.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate and the presence of members," he says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a one-man minority.
In September 1986, at the age of 18, I went in a disturbingly shy way.
The hate against the Conservative Party was at its hottest time.
The previous year, he voted to deny the honor of his former student, Margaret Thatcher, due to the cuts in university higher education payments.
This atmosphere made a pro-Stalin tremble with fear.
On the first few days of the first week, while students were socializing with each other and with teachers, I tasted the pain that was coming.
I would have seen the teachers enjoying the ridicule of conservative students as well as ignoring them.
Opposition politics were brought to the wooden paneled rooms of the mining strike, privatisation and government's sanctions against South Africa.
The first one was about me translating French texts from the 18th century into English, and I was unprepared for what came next.
"Mrs. Wyatt, please translate the first paragraph," said Professor Harry Pitt.
I stumbled on this.
Pitt, a little guy with a face that looked like cake dough, had a lot of setbacks.
He said, "Do the Thatchers refuse to learn French or are they just idiots?"
Other grad students giggled.
Tears hurt the back of my eyes.
"If you're not too busy socializing in your spare time, I suggest you take basic French lessons," said Pitt.
I walked back to my room with a painful face.
That night, I sat alone at a college dinner, and then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
This was a sophomore English student named James who identified himself as a member of the OUCA.
He politely said, "I know who you are."
I'm afraid so.
Anyone suspected of being conservative is being dealt with.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative first-year students act like they're pro-employees.
Then, in a local bar, I tried to fake it like a coward.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Miss Thatcher said.
This tactic has proven its failure.
"You are the daughter of a fascist pig," said a first-class PPE student who was ironically on Eton.
You're dirty.
The other students held back.
I was a pervert. I was dirty.
Someone asked, "How do conservatives have sex?"
They beat each other up, don't they?
I felt like gay people would have felt before the liberal life of the '60s.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford?
Am I to be forced to meet people who agree only when it's dark?
Go back to the working party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years ahead of me lie like a purgatory of exile and loneliness.
The only open conservative in my university was Norman Stone, Professor of Modern History.
He was hated for being a conservative and a foreign policy consultant and a copywriter of Thatcher.
He was only there for a little while.
It was small and rural, and the Marxist was disgusted by his commitment to the idea of needing history.
In 1997, he began his professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
He said, "You won't be happy there."
I started going back and forth from Oxford to my parents' house in London, and I took refuge with my more open-minded big-city friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
In his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
Patheticly, he said, "But it's the best place in the world."
They don't do that, not in my dream towers.
Even my communist friends always had excellent manners.
His moist eyes began to cloud.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure this is all a joke.
If you leave, it'll break my heart.
My emotional resilience, tired of frequent visits to London, was weakening.
A conservative boyfriend of mine gave in to pressure and rejected his faith.
The next week during a training session, another history professor said I was a total and utter public enemy, so I decided to do the same thing.
I confessed, shyly embarrassed, that I was brainwashed by my parents, and I called them old fools.
The breathing was short-lived.
Oxford was my father who nailed the coffin of my career.
Well, then, every week on Murdoch's broadcast, he wrote two column articles.
My door was locked.
I snuck in, and five minutes later, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a wimp who whines.
However, no 18 - year - old should be subjected to such intimidation and sarcasm in an educational institution.
What's even more tragic is that Oxford has released both 14 conservative prime ministers and is hiding behind a reputation of equality and freedom of thought that it doesn't deserve until today.
In Trabzon, the flood swallowed up two people
Two of the rivers were flooded due to heavy showers in Yomra district of Trabzon.
The two women who were in the flood were lost in the village of Taşdelen, while the road to the village of Sayvan was closed.
One of the two women missing in the flood was found.
The rainfall was effective in Yomra's high part around 3:00 p.m.
When the two of them moved, nearly 200m of the road connecting the village of the two of them to the village of Sayvan was flooded.
"The road has been closed for three hours.
We're going through the same thing every time it rains.
We've notified the authorities, but no one's coming or going.
Citizens are devastated.
We go through this every year.
When the trees block the stream, the water leaves."
ATTACKED TO A PERSON'S DEATH
Yomra Mayor Ibrahim Kağıroğlu has reported that one of the two women who disappeared in the flood due to a dramatic flood in the district had been found and that the search for the other person has continued.
Kığıroğlu reminded that a flood struck in the town yesterday and two women who were gathering nuts in the village of Taşdelen disappeared into the floodwater.
"One of our citizens' bodies has been reached in the ground, and the search for the other continues," he said, adding that late-night search efforts have been restarted early in the morning.
The rain has lost its effect and has replaced it with sunny weather, he added, adding that the search for the missing person and work on closed roads are being carried out safely.
While searching for missing women, the road to the village of Taşdelen has been reportedly opened.
"THE TEST WILL NOT BE CONTROL"
Citizens in the village of Taşdelen, in the District of Yomra, Trabzon are trying to heal the injuries of the flood and landslide disaster due to a downpour.
Derya, a resident of the village of Taşdelen, noted that the rain continued for about three hours continuously, saying, "It did not rain, it seemed like a disaster."
"We stopped collecting nuts.
Later, such a disaster occurred.
The missing bride and mother-in-law were picking nuts during the rain.
Then on their way home, they were caught in a landslide."
The electricity is out in their villages and their water is not flowing, he added.
Hasan Selim stressed that he had reached 60 years of age and had not seen such rain until his age, saying, "If the rain had continued for another hour, there would have been no stone in this area."

You're facing hundreds of stories in the area of social security and working life in the written and visual media.
From now on, I will present to you the most accurate, healthy and reliable news in the Hurriyet newspaper and at the Hurriyet.com.tr.
First, I'd like to discuss the very public disability file.
We're going to go through these articles in sections that are going to go on as a series of articles.
In our article, you can find answers to all questions regarding disability.
You can send your questions that you have not found and that concern you in particular to @hurrity.com.tr.
I'll be working hard to answer you as soon as possible.
What's disability pension?
MALULEN is the opportunity to retire early, given that they have met the insurance requirements of the SGK law, which has lost the labour force by at least 60 per cent and is unable to work.
It is also the case where public employees can retire when they lose their ability to earn their jobs in order to do their job, apart from those mentioned above.
Who's considered malul?
I write from Diyarbakir, my name is Mehmet Gültekin, I have 920 days' insurance and I have 1460 days' insurance with 540 days of military debt.
Besides, I'm a kidney patient.
I'm connecting to the dialysis machine.
I still work at a job.
Can I get a disability month?
- Mr. Mehmet, feel better first.
You didn't mention the first time you got a job in your question.
However, let us briefly explain to you how the disability will be connected.
First of all, the most important of the conditions specified in the law is that it has been insured for 10 years and you have to have a total of 1,800 days of bonus days.
In addition, when it is determined that you have lost at least 60 per cent of your labour power or occupational illness by the health of the SGK, you are considered a disability.
However, since you're here with dialysis, you're providing 60 percent of the condition that the 1,800 premiums cannot be connected per month because you haven't filled the number of days.
Of course, we don't know how many years you've worked.
If you apply to the SGK on the condition that you leave work on the day you complete 10 years and 1,800 days together, you will receive a monthly connection.
Conditions for granting disability monthly rights
Can't anyone retire if they don't have 10 years, 1800 days on disability?
The terms of payment for 1,800 days must be complete.
However, there is only one exception, and for those who are determined to have a permanent disability for someone else, the disability monthly allowance is tied, provided that they meet other conditions, regardless of the ten-year insurance period.
In the next chapter of our article, we will discuss which diseases or disorders will be considered in need of constant care.
The condition of the disabled before they start working
I'm Ahmet Guler.
Even though I carried all the conditions in the SGK law, they told me I couldn't get a disability month because I was sick for the first time before I got a job.
I'm a victim.
Isn't that unfair?
How can I retire?
Mr. Ahmet, you have written that you provide all the conditions in the Law, but for the SSK and Link-Kur-insured people, one of the main conditions in the law, it is imperative that the disease does not exist before it comes into work.
The disability month cannot be connected because you do not have this condition.
However, you can retire when you are covered by old age insurance.
- I've got 3980 days, and I've been insured for 16 years.
My disability was determined by the SGK before I got a job.
They told me you couldn't retire.
So what am I supposed to do?
I won't be able to retire.
Will you guide me?
- Yeah, that's right.
You can't retire on disability.
But the SGK law also has a pension prescription for you.
Well, there are two conditions before and after 2008 October.
If you first started working before this date, if the SGK determines that you are disabled before you work, you can receive a partial age monthly pension on the basis of at least 15 years of insurance and 3600 bonus days.
Therefore, we recommend that you apply for a monthly commitment by applying for a visit to the nearest SGK Directorate.
- Well, if you'd gotten a job after October 2008, then you'd have been insured for at least 15 years, and you'd get an old-age pension on the condition that at least 3960 days of disability, old age and death insurance were reported.
Do you have to quit when you apply?
I still work as a driver at a workplace.
When I got to the hospital, I was diagnosed with cancer.
I want to retire on disability.
In that case, do I have to leave work?
Can't I apply for disability before I leave?
I don't want to be out of a job until I'm tied up for the month.
- That's right.
You must quit your job to file a monthly commitment application.
However, before applying for a monthly grant, you must be considered a disability under the SGK law.
However, if you are disabled, it will be attached to you monthly, along with other conditions.
There's no point in making a monthly commitment petition without a disability, you're at risk of being unemployed.
You just have to have 1,800 days for it.
When you go to the SGK and file a petition to determine my disability, the SGC will transfer you to one of the authorized hospitals.
When you bring your health board report to the SGK, which you will receive here, the SGK will evaluate it on its own health board, and if it decides that your cancer has affected your workforce loss by over 60 per cent, it will give you a reason to apply for a monthly commitment application.
However, if you also need to complete the ten-year insurance period for your monthly allowance to be connected to you per month, it will be available to you.
So let's just say that it's not rational for employees to apply for the health board without seeing the verdict "you're disabled."
But if the insurance people who don't work at any job carry all the conditions, they can ask the SGK to determine the disability situation and to connect monthly.
If this is a disability and it carries other conditions, it may be useful for him to start his month a little earlier.
Does a debt-of-the-bind retire?
I'm a bond-Current.
I carry all the conditions.
But they said that because I owe you money, you can't retire.
What should I do?
- I'm a valuable reader.
Whoever told you is telling the truth.
You haven't written down what the other conditions are, but if you think you're carrying these conditions, it's a legal obligation to pay off your 4/b bonus debt.
But I can give you a special tip.
Since you're being paid, I suggest you pay your debt by making a tool of banks or such organizations.
The sooner he's tied up, the more months you'll get, and the sooner you'll pay him back.
It'll be easy to borrow money from these companies for cutting out your monthly allowance.
According to what status does a disability month depend on?
I worked under both the S.S.K. and the Bond-Kurd and the Retired Ark.
When I deserve a month, how is he gonna connect to me?
- I read valuables, if you've worked at multiple status as a Lig-Kurd, SSK, and as an officer, your disability allowance depends on the state of insurance, so if you're last insured by the SSK, you'll get a monthly allowance from the SSK, provided you leave a job and carry other conditions.
Hospital reports that apply to the SGK
How do you apply for disability?
What hospitals can I get a medical report from?
For the health board reports, you can only apply for social security directorates or social security centres you belong to.
The SGK will transfer you to the Ministry of Health education and research hospitals, university hospitals (except private university and foundation hospitals), military hospitals belonging to the Turkish Armed Forces.
However, if these hospitals do not exist in your municipality of residence, you can also be transferred to the full-fledged hospitals of the Ministry of Health.
Isn't it possible to transfer to a private hospital?
- It's possible, but there are conditions.
The old arrangement is that the transfer of patients who are in intensive care and who are in critical care can be carried out to the hospital where they are in critical condition, while the new regulations that will now be implemented at 01.09.2013 will now be agreed to with the SGK, and that they can be transferred to a private hospital where patients who are in intensive care are at risk, and the medical board reports you have received will be considered valid.
What are the conditions for the transfer?
It is sufficient that you have 1,800 days of premiums to make a transfer to determine the disability situation of the person in the claim of love.
Hospital costs related to disability detection will be paid by the SGK.
Also, there will be no ten-year insurance call.
In the event of the disability month's commitment, if the person is in need of medical attention, the ten-year insurance period, which is between the conditions of insurance, is only sufficient for 1,800 days, according to the health board report.
Therefore, when a person first comes to determine his disability, the SGK is seeking disability based only on 1,800 days, in case he is in need of care.
Operation Nargile
Nargile has begun inspections of the police for bans being imposed on cafes.
After the weekend inspections, many businesses had to stop selling bongs.
The police have launched an operation with the notice that has entered into the bong cafes in Istanbul.
The operation carried out at the bong cafes in Beşiktaş region and sold bongs to unlicensed businesses.
Almost all bong cafes will be affected by inspections, while those who continue to sell bongs will be fined in the first place.
Businesses that continue to sell will be sealed off.
THE SALES HAVE BEEN STOPD
The Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Agency (TAPDK) was published in February.
The announcement gave five months to move the bong cafes at least 200 meters from the schools.
And no bongs in closed spaces.
The first operation on businesses that did not comply with the notice began from Besiktas as of the other day.
Many unlicensed businesses in Istanbul's most popular bong venues, Al Faker in Babel, the Ikram Nargile Cafe in the Ihlamur Kasrı and the Mis Nargile Cafe in Besiktaş, had to stop their sales.
The fines start at 23,000.
The police will issue fines starting at $23,000 if unlicensed locations continue to sell bongs.
Three-time fines will be sealed.
Currently, some five businesses in Istanbul allegedly have a bong café license.
Warnings on bottles
TAPDK had made it necessary for operators to ‘warn’ the bong bottles as of July 27. Health warnings were either cylindrical or conical according to the format of the bong bottle.
Warnings are being applied to begin with in the mouth section of the bottles.
Blue, red, yellow, and black colors can be used for printing health warnings.
At the moment, there are warnings at several bong cafes.
Critical warning from police to families
The Police General Directorate warns families of activities organised by illegal organisations under the name "summer camp", "student camp" to gather supporters.
Following intelligence gathered in 17 provinces, the teams of the Anti-Terror Bureau revealed the new plan of organisations, including DHKP-C, MLKP, TKP, TKP, and some legal structures.
Security forces determined that terrorist organisations are organizing "summer camp" for young people to gather fans, under the name "student camp", warned families not to send children to these camps.
The terrorist police, who determined that terrorist organizations were planning to organise 41 camps in different cities, asked the families not to send their children to these camps.
350 families have given up sending their children to camp
The terrorist police, particularly using legal extensions of terrorist organisations such as DHKP-C, MLKP and TKP, warned the families they were meeting against activities under the name of camp.
Taking into account the warnings given by the police, 350 families have given up sending their children to the camps in question.
Following police warnings, 14 of the 41 camps organised by the organisations have been cancelled.
Terrorist organisations have conducted 20 camps, although turnout has declined.
The two camps are still under way, while the five camps are scheduled to be held in the days to come, security forces said.
Police General Directorate also sent notices to all relevant units in all provinces regarding these camps.
Young people are being set up
The 20 camps carried out by terrorist organizations were held in İzmir, Kocaeli, Balıkesir, Çanakkale, Niğde, Eskişehir, Bursa, Bartin, Artvin, Mersin and Hatay, while the camps of the Army, Samsun, Trabzon, Bartın, Izmir, Bolu and Adana were cancelled.
According to police reports, these camps are often attended by young people who have just graduated from college.
Illegal organizations entrap young people with their propaganda in camps and bring them to the organization.
These camps also promote the commitment of young people to the organisation by providing organisational training to young people who have just joined the organisation.
These camps under the image of summer camp are training on things such as organised education, as well as "how actions can be transformed into violence".
The message that came out after half a century
A bottle thrown into the Atlantic by a boy named Dennis Komsa 50 years ago found its owner in New Jersey, United States.
The glass bottle came from the wreckage around a house after Hurricane Sandy last year in the United States.
"To the person concerned, please answer the following questions and send them to the address below.
This is a scientific study by Dennis Komsa (12)."
In the article, the person who found the bottle is asked to describe where, when, and how.
The bottle also contains an envelope and a coin to pay for the mail.
The bottle, dated August 16, 1963, was recently given to its owner, about 35km from where it was dumped on the coast of New Jersey.
Komsa, 12 years old in 1963, said it was a surprise to see the bottle she threw into the ocean nearly half a century later, saying, "I threw it in the water thinking someone would find it, but I never thought it would come back to me."
The sound makes the frequencies fall in love
One of Turkey's first sound engineers, Suden Pamir, told me what can be done with sound frequencies, and I'm surprised.
When you say sound technologies or sound engineering, it's almost like everybody's thinking about musical sound systems.
Did you know that sound technologies and terrorism can be prevented, that you can commit perfect murder with a dot frequency shot, that you can make anyone fall in love with you, that you can get them to admit a secret, or adapt to the rhythm of the world?
After completing the University of Bilkent Department of Internal Architecture, Suden Pamir received a degree in audio engineering at the SAE College in England and a master's degree in sound technology at Middlesex University.
Beyoglu also raises sound engineers at the Communication Technology Music Academy of Music at Galatasaray, and teaches music technology, sound technology, performance technologies, electronic music and advanced recording techniques.
Subliminal message to terrorism
"What exactly is sound technology?" is my first question.
"A technology that can be used in many fields around the world.
Our brain perceives everything through electrical currents.
The sound frequency is a kind of electrical current, energy.
You can use this energy to change people's perceptions, make them move at any command you want."
One of the most important subdivisions of sound technology is the subliminal message.
In the music or song, a message is placed on a frequency outside the human range of perception, which is not defined by the upper memory, but goes to the lower memory.
For example, when a terrorist attack is reported, there could be a music broadcast in that area, according to Pamir.
If a message, such as "Don't do this attack", is modified to the song that's being released, it will detect this message with selectiveness in the terrorist perception.
He doesn't know what it is he's hearing, but his lower memory perceives it, and inside, it sounds like he's saying, "Don't do it."
He even considers it a reminder to him from Allah.
However, in the world and Turkey, such messages are strictly forbidden and penalised to be used outside public security.
Süden Pamir is a subliminal message prepared at a conference at Istanbul Technical University just once to be able to explain the subject to the students.
"I played music for the students during the conference.
I put a frequency in the music that begged for water.
At the end of the presentation, I asked the students if they were thirsty.
They all said they were surprisingly thirsty," he says.
"Some radio stations in our country have been identified as doing this, but details are not yet known.
In Germany, there's a channel called Radio Black Sound, a frequency of radical Islamists.
Subliminally, it releases messages that are highly aggressive, religiously involved, call for jihad, commanding drug use.
The German police and Turkish police both know that, but they can't deal with it because they constantly change frequencies," he said.
Also, in the music world, such dangerous messages are being used.
Especially in the songs of some heavy metal bands...
According to these allegations, there were no terrorists on the planes entering the towers, the attack was carried out by subliminal commands directly to the pilot's lower consciousness.
Confidence table
Sound technologies can also be used in criminal cases.
In the U.S., it's especially used in bank robberies.
For example, as soon as the police make phone contact with the robber, sound engineers can identify the person in the bank, in which room he is in.
When a voice hits metal, wood, plastic, wall, or anything else, the echo is different.
According to the sound echo, it's also possible to determine the size of the room where it is, even the shape of the room, how many corners it has.
Thus, it can be determined which items were found in the voice of the offender, in which size and shape he was in a room.
There's also a computer program used to do this, which Pamir even drew on an opera house in Tataristan, which said, "I calculated that wherever 175 speakers are placed in the building, the perfect sound system could be provided.
It's not expensive technology, it's worth $45,000," he said.
Sound frequencies are also used in architecture and decoration.
Pamir has a lot of work to do about it.
For example, in a restaurant where businessmen go, where they have high-level auction meetings, he's built a setup where voices can't get out of the meeting table.
Only the people at the table can hear what they're saying.
Two feet away, someone else can't hear anything on the table.
The general system of these types of devices is: "If you want to destroy a sound, you will collide with the opposite of your own molecular structure and turn it into heat by destroying existing sound energy.
No one would've been able to get on a plane without this system anyway.
Because the sound of aircraft engines is unbearable.
On the plane, these voices destroy themselves by being subjected to each other.
With this system, even if your windows are open, you can create a peaceful environment in your home without noise."
The pyramids of Egypt were made by sound?
There are other interesting things that one of Turkey's first sound engineers, Pamir, has done.
For example, he built an outdoor disco in Ayvalik where music can't be heard from outside.
The sound cannot go beyond the boundary drawn, compared to another sound frequency and destroyed.
Even inside a room, if asked, can be done quietly after a certain line.
Pamir made a school gym suitable for both sports and concerts.
It's double-use.
Because when you play basketball, you need an echo, but concerts don't need an echo.
And in outdoor concerts, it's possible to provide sound quality that only music can be heard.
"We use frequencies that eliminate unnecessary, noise-like sounds, which correct human perception, which enable music to be clearer.
MTV is way ahead of us on this.
He organises outdoor concerts and sounds like a studio recording in the area."
Tubitak had an experiment like this.
Separate the sound frequencies from the two aluminum plates.
There were scientists who claimed the Egyptian pyramids were made with sound.
They thought the stones might have been removed and planted by sound.
I'm asking, "Is the sound not good enough to use for bad purposes?"
"I was already so scared when I read about York University's work online, "that maybe other people would read it.
Because if it is tried out of laboratory conditions, even by well-intentioned people, it could lead to incredibly bad consequences," he said.
"The prayers are effective in Arabic"
Suden Pamir, who says noise pollution will affect you in a negative way, explains why: "Because all the sounds of the ear are being transmitted to the brain.
Although one hears a voice when one concentrates alone, the other sounds are transmitted to the brain, and it causes fatigue.
You need to clear your brain, so it's good to walk barefoot in the soil, take nature walks.
I think schools should be set up to absorb noise.
So the student concentrates on the voice of the teacher alone and can concentrate longer."
Pamir says she believes that prayers will also be effective if they are read in Arabic because of the characteristics of the sound frequencies, adding that Arabic has a very rich range of frequencies, noting that the sounds in the words have a very positive effect when they come together.
He says, "But you have to say the prayers out loud. I tremble when I read Yasin."
Frequency and love recipe
"Is it possible to make a person fall in love with sound frequencies?"
The love Pamir gave you, or rather the frequency description of the person's emotions, is like, "First you have to find the dominant frequency that the person you want to love is using when they talk.
You can affect it by using a higher frequency than this frequency.
Consider, for example, the dominant frequency of the person is 300.
And when you're with him, you want to play a music to liven up his feelings.
If you lower the power of the single-digit ones from the frequencies above 300 frequencies of the music you're going to play and make the two-digit ones dominant, that person's ability to be affected will increase.
Maybe this way she'll fall in love with the person she's in love with."
Pamir also mentions that politicians around the world have special sound systems to speak more effectively, and when bass sounds come to light, the politician is very powerful, and a stage artist can be made to feel like a supernatural awesome being.
"What do you think that sounds like?" Pamir replied, "I think it's close to the human voice because the sound that affects you the most is close to its own voice.
For example, what is a magnificent instrument, like it's made from human breath."
'Gold prices will rise'
"The gold will continue to play its role as a safe saving tool," Canadian Jennings Capital Inc.'s Senior Golden Analyst Dan Hrushewsky said, adding that governments are working to reduce their debt by reducing the value of monetary units.
"The demand for gold from China is rising in connection with India, and Chinese investors are playing a big part in it," Hrushewsky told the AA correspondent, who assessed the price-making demand for the rise in last week's most profitable investment vehicle, saying investors in China and India seem to be providing support for prices through low prices.
"I believe that the government's attempts to manage the current accounts are no longer popular by limiting the government's imports of gold.
People will find a way in this framework."
Hrushewsky advised investors to invest in the long term, saying, "The gold will continue to serve as a safe saving tool.
The rising levels of debt are forgotten by the lack of discipline that many Western governments have.
Governments are trying to reduce their debt by reducing the value of monetary units.
Therefore, the prices of gold will rise from their current level," he said.
"In the long run, gold is improving its ability to reduce market risks."
World Gold Council Investment Director Marcus Grubb said that gold is a physical entity that offers simple, transparent and reliable properties in more complex and volatile financial markets, adding, "In the long run, instead of falling gold, it improves in its ability to reduce its basic improved properties and market risks.
The gold portfolios of small amounts proved that income stability has improved, usually much more durable and that it is better to deal with market uncertainty."
"The gold represents less than 1 per cent of the total global investment assets.
This means that the market opportunities for growth in gold investment are still very important.
In this quarter, strong capital inputs into the gold and coin, which increased 78 per cent compared to last year, show that the interest in investors under it is preserved," he said.
"India must increase national gold reserves to support economic growth"
Answering questions about India and China, Grubb, the world's largest gold market, said the decline in gold prices encouraged demand for jewelry, bullion, gold and coins in the second quarter of the year, which boosted the investment appetites of consumers in Asia.
Grubb reminded him that China's demand for jewelry increased by 54 per cent and India by 51 per cent.
"In terms of the demand for jewelry, China is usually quiet in the second half.
After the unexpected decline of gold prices in April, demand rose, and the jeweler's stocks ran out quickly," he said.
"In the nature of gold demand, it is difficult to conduct restrictive demand practices at the retail level of gold, and therefore it can meet unauthorized channels.
The World Gold Council believes that India should consider gold a strategic investment in its policies.
In addition, it has to increase national gold reserves to support economic growth in line with long-term policy goals."
Global Gold Trends
Global demand for gold was 856.3 tonnes, global coins and bullion investments were 508 tons in the second quarter of this year, according to a global Golden Council report announced last week.
A significant increase in the country's demand for jewelry was observed in the second quarter of the year, compared to the same period last year, the demand for jewelry rose 54 per cent in China, 51 per cent in India, 38 per cent in Turkey and 33 per cent in the Middle East.
During this period, the demand for consumers in China continued to grow strong, and gold acquisition increased by 87 per cent compared to the same quarter of last year, with prices expected to increase in the coming period, and totaling 276 tonnes this year.
In India, the government raised taxes to prevent the rise of gold imports in the first quarter, but consumer demand rose 71 per cent compared to last year and increased 310 tonnes.
A warm film by the Black Sea — Servants of the Hill
Directed by a doctor in Trabzon...
The actors are the lovely, red-cheeked, smiley residents of Flowerdipville, where the film was made.
Free to Love
There's no lines, lots of improvisation and laughter in the movie, which only cost $400,000.
Under the leadership of Ismet Eraddin, a film starring in the love of cinema, "The Hill's Servants 1980", has made it a goal to make everyone see a true Black Sea story.
The premiere of the film "The Foot of the Hill 1980", made up of amateur actors in Akçaabat's Flowerfall Village, has also produced entertainment images such as the film itself.
The forum was of interest to the press at the Cinemaximum Cinemas of the Mall.
The team that had a rather crowded gala night, with the horons, with the Black Sea songs, had a wonderful night.
The premiere was attended mainly by Deputy Minister of Environment and Urbanism Muhammet Balta, Trabzon Mayor Dr. Orhan Fevzi Customscioğlu, Provincial Security Director Ertan Serg, Provincial Culture and Tourism Director İsmail Kanless, Akçaababat sub-Governor Abdul Rauf Ulusoy, Akçaababat Mayor Şefik Türkmen and several guests, as well as the managers of sponsors, national and local press representatives.
In the film directed and directed by Dr. İsmet Eradın and directed by Altuğ Yükçı, Samet Karahasanoğlu, Ayşe Öztürk, Koral Koç, Selahattin Çakır, Free Saral, Adem Eradın and Vaide Eradın share the lead roles in the film.
In 1980, Turkish subtitles were used to better understand the Black Sea dialect for the first time in Turkey, which was released with 61 copies today.
The shining star on the hill!
Samet Karahasanoglu, a leading actor in the film, is only 18 years old.
From Samet, who lives in Trabzon, you're watching what's best for acting.
The actor, with an amateur theater background, has successfully risen from the scene of comedy and drama in the film.
Samet Karahasanoglu, who deserves his applause to the end, has captured the phrase, "Your future will be one of the most wanted players in the audience" with its huge performance.
Comedy and drama together!
In Trabzon's Florist Sea village, the subject of the film is as follows:
"The main character of the film is young Hikmet's father in Germany.
One of Hikmet's great dreams is to continue schooling in winter and shepherding in summer is to complete his training and become a doctor.
But it's not a big deal to read and work at the same time.
Especially when it comes to his love for Züleyha, daughter of the richest family in the village.
In front of Hikmet, who has decided to tell Züleyha about this love he's been hiding for years with his friends, there is a difficult obstacle, such as Züleyha's father, Sabri Agha.
Sabri Agha has other plans for his daughter.
On the other hand, it is one of the biggest obsessions of the surrounding villages that they have been playing on, and it has waged a war against the villagers over this hill."
Longer than the short film, metraja...
At the gala, the writers and director of the film, Dr. Ismet Eradın, announced the following things about the Hill's footmen, whom they made with a very small budget:
"When we started this film, our goal was to make a short film.
But the footage of the first shots was so much attention on social media that we started to get excited and filmed to get us into the long distance.
When we went to Istanbul to the distributors, they said, "Do you have a celebrity player?"
And I said, "We don't have any looks, but I have 86 Black Sea players you won't find anywhere."
In movies and TV shows, very bad accents have been used and misrepresented by the Black Sea people.
You're about to see 86 original Black Sea people in the next movie.
I tried to make a Black Sea movie.
I wish other people had taken it before me so we could watch a comedy without swearing.
I shouldn't have made this movie if the Black Sea person hadn't been misrepresented.
For the first time, we put a Turkish subtitle in the Turkish film.
That'll be a first.
We did it so the Black Sea dialect could be understood better.
We also wrote a subtitle that translates the English-speaking scenes in the film into the Black Sea dialect.
Whoever we turned the camera on when we made this movie turned out to be an actor.
The footmen of the hill is our first film.
I may have my faults, I may have my shortcomings," he said.
Don't miss this warm film that brings a new breath to black sea movies!
Watch out for Your Perfume!
Be careful if you have a high sense of self - care, even if you overdo it and walk around with a bottle of perfume.
The perfume you're using can cause skin disease.
We talked to Civatte Poikiloderma, which is more common in women and is mainly due to various cosmetics, Dr. Funda Ataman, an expert in Intercontinental Hospital Dermatology.
Uzm. Dr. Ataman, who says that the side of Civatte Poikiloderma has a discoloration disorder on the neck and chest cleavage (which the chin shaded), is often attributed to staying in the sun.
It's seen in the form of brown red stains.
Skin is thin, veiny, and hair roots are distinctive.
Pulse dye is one of the options for laser therapy and solar protection.
Another is the use of creams containing retinanic acid.
These creams should be used for a long time.
The rash, the itch, is not a side effect or an allergy that occurs during use.
In this case, the treatment must be continued at intervals.
Since it can be family, those with Civatte Poikilodema should be conscious of protection and treatment at an early age.'
Huge drop in cigarette consumption
The amount of cigarettes smoked in Turkey in the first six months of this year has decreased by 10 per cent compared to the same period last year, down to 41 billion 779m men.
The amount of cigarettes smoked in Turkey in the first six months of this year dropped by 10 per cent compared to the same period last year, down to 41 billion 779m, 190,560.
According to information from the Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Agency (TAPDK), the Global Adult Tobacco Research (KYTA) conducted in Turkey to gain information on the use of tobacco products for adults and to provide data for decision-makers and researchers in this regard has been completed.
According to the survey results, 31.2 per cent of individuals aged 15 and higher in Turkey in 2008 (16 million people) use tobacco products every day or occasionally, the rate dropped to 27.1 per cent (14.8 million people) in 2012, and the prevalence of tobacco products has declined by 13.4 per cent.
41.5% of men, 13.1% of women use tobacco.
The proportion of tobacco users fell from 47.9 per cent to 41.5 per cent in men and from 15.2 per cent in women to 13.1 per cent.
According to the study, six out of 10 tobacco users are considering quitting smoking.
The proportion of those who plan to leave tobacco product within a month is 12.9 per cent and 35.4 per cent of those who plan to leave it within 12 months.
In the evaluation section of the study, the following views were included:
"The clear result in consumption of tobacco products indicates that tobacco control laws and the National Tobacco Control Programme and Action Plan are being implemented effectively in Turkey.
Thus, the number of tobacco consumers from 2008 to 2012 has decreased by 2 million and 200,000 people, and the frequency of use has decreased by 4.1 per cent. The most significant reduction in smoking use has been in the areas that are sensitive to price growth, such as young people and undereducated people.
Turkey was the first and only country in the World Health Organization's Global Tobacco Influenza Report in 2013 to achieve a high level of tobacco control, providing all the criteria, according to the World Health Organization's Global Tobacco Influenza Report.
The report asked other countries to follow Turkey and follow its example."
The ban on smoking in closed spaces continues to take effect.
The amount of cigarettes smoked during the first six months of this year dropped by 10 per cent compared to the same period last year, down to 41 billion 779 million, 190,560.
During the same period of 2012, the figure was at a level of 46 billion, 325 million, 44,100.
The walls will be touch screens now!
Ubi Interactive has released a very interesting product that uses Microsoft's 'Kinect' technology.
Microsoft included Kinect in 11 new companies last year on the Kinect Accelerator programme to support projects that would be used at Windows.
The software giant provided money, location, hardware support to these companies.
One of the most interesting software demos produced by the Kinect Accelerator was shown by the Ubi Interactive.
In the demo, an ordinary projector comes together with Kinect for Windows, and the projection on the wall is transformed into a giant touch screen.
According to a new post on the Kinect for Windows website, there are several companies testing this technology.
In the special beta process, over 50 companies are now being tested by Ubi for sale.
Prices are available on Ubi's website.
For a 45-inch touch screen, you're gonna have to give up $149.
A 100-inch touch screen that can detect touch from 20 points will cost you $1,499.
Ubi's software and Kinect for Windows are included in the prices, but you need to buy the projector separately.
Another innovation for the Android!
With Google's patent, it'll make it easier to file-send.
Among mobile operating systems, Google, which has been a clear winner with Android, has patented a new interface technology that will often benefit those who share files with their friends.
The function for sharing content through wireless technologies such as NFC and Bluetooth is not very different from the example of Android Beam and Apple Airdrop.
The last innovation with Google signature is that it allows it to spread to the nearby user groups instead of one-time sharings, and it offers drag-off ease to users.
The new feature appears to be in the future Android versions...
Here's Turkey's first local smart phone
Turkcell got into the smart phone business.
The factory of smartphones to be made jointly with China will be in Turkey.
His name is T40.
Turkcell introduced Turkey's first domestic intelligence phone.
The TCELL design will be released at the end of September as well as the smart phone T40, which will be produced in Turkey, along with China.
Turkcell General Manager Süreyya Ciliv said they plan to present the smart phone T40, developed in co-operation with US chip manufacturer Qualcomm, and introduced as the Gebze project in February, to the sale in nine countries where Turkcell operates.
"Some of the T40 will start being produced in China before the end of the year 2013," Ciliv said in a presentation at T40's launch.
YOUR SLEEP WILL BE A FUTURE
Ciliv said they would present the phone at a fair price, saying they would announce the final price close to the sale.
Ciliv said they aim to increase the use of data and expand their revenues by offering the market a smartphone at a more accessible price than selling equipment with the T40.
Ciliv said that a million of Turkcell's T-series have been sold from 2010 to the sale, bringing down the foreign trade deficit by 500m euros.
It'll be too soon for him to break into the market.
Turkcell General Manager Süreyya Ciliv said T40 would have features such as noise prevention, high resolution sound, round sound and adjustable user interface.
He said the price of T40 would be announced before the phone went public, and the price of the phone would be appropriate.
EVERY YEAR 5 MILLION DOLLARS GO OUT
Tayfun Acarer, president of the Information Technologies and Communications Agency (BTK), who spoke at the meeting, also said they support local production. " 57 per cent of the calls to Turkey are smartphones.
Because of this increase, the average price of phones sold for $300.
We import $5 billion of phones from 15 million each year, and I'm worried that this is going to get bigger and bigger."
The T40, which will work on the Android operating system platform, will have the Qualcomm double core processor and 1 GB RAM.
They're all imam speakers!
The records of students in regular secondary school have been renewed as imam oratorium students
The MEB transformed all primary schools in Turkey last year as primary schools, secondary schools and imam or imam or a secondary school after its 4+4 arrangement in education.
After a year of training, it turned out that the ministry had signed a new scandal in the process of transforming several schools into imam speakers in line with "need".
The "transformation" scandal in Turkey, which could interest the current students of all schools turned into imam or a secondary school this year, came to the agenda during transformation and registration renewal at the Candy Middle School in Konya's Meram district.
1 year normal secondary school
The Candy Elementary School was converted to middle school early last year after a 4+4+4 arrangement.
At school, students from elementary school 3rd and 4th grade, 6th and 7th and 8th graders were studying together, which, by means of the system, would be moving to another school.
The school, which served as a regular middle school for a year, was transformed into imam oratorium after the end of the 2012-2013 school year.
For the first time this year, the school had accepted fifth graders as "Imam orator students".
However, last year, the records of students who attended the 5th grade in the normal middle school and were to enter the 6th grade this year were automatically renewed as imam ore secondary school students.
'Other school that doesn't want to'
Parents who found out about the situation complained by coming to school.
However, the school board told parents, following instructions from the province’s national education directorate, "The parents who don’t want their children to continue in imam oratorium, can have their registration transferred to another secondary school."
In a statement issued by Konya Il National Education Directorate, interesting statements were included.
"We have transformed some schools again by considering student and school numbers and preferences. In this context, 15-20 schools in Konya have been translated into imam speakers.
The schools are entering the ministry's e-school system with school codes.
But when the school is converted to imam, the code to the old school is erased from the system.
The new school code has to be opened and the students have to be logged into the system.
Both students and teachers of the changing school used the new institution code to transfer students to imam or a secondary school so that they would not be victims.
The parents who want to take their children's transfers from these schools to other schools."
A luxury yacht operation in Istanbul!
8 yachts for 160 million liras confiscated
The operation, conducted by customs teams in Istanbul, confiscated eight yachts that were sold from one foreign country to another, which should not enter the Turkish customs zone.
According to a written statement by the Ministry of Customs and Trade, the operation launched by the Istanbul Customs and Trade District Directorate and the İstanbul Marine Customs Customs Trafficking and Intelligence Directorate has been determined that it has been delivered on behalf of a shell company from the Haydarpaşa Gümrum, which has purchased eight yachts from Turkey's Turkish citizen E.E.A. from France, "to rent a flag".
Following a review by customs protection teams, E.E.A. brought yachts to sell in Turkey.
Eight yachts sold from one foreign country to another, which should not have entered the Turkish customs zone, and items such as service boats, radar systems, generators were confiscated.
The total customs value of confiscated motor yachts has been determined to be $160m.
Metrobus hit a pedestrian!
On the other side of the road in the chainchainuyu...
The metrobus, which moved from Willows to Hunters, hit Yavuzcan Dulgun, who suddenly wanted to cross the road at the Chainridge station around 1:30 p.m.
The widow was thrown to the ground by the impact.
The wounded Yavuzcan Dulgun was taken to Bezmialem University Faculty of Medicine in the ambulance that arrived at the scene.
Dulgun, who was treated at the hospital, was found to be in no danger of his life.
On the other hand, citizens claimed that the ambulance arrived late.
The police have launched an investigation into the accident.
Prosecutor called the ministry 'controversial'
Family Ministry's request denied
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
In the trial of Abbas Şahin, who killed his wife, Pınar Şahin, who filed for divorce, the prosecutor dismissed the request of the Ministry of the Family on the grounds that there was no violence.
Abbas Şahin, the mother of Pınar Şahin who was killed, Ayşe Twin, sister Gift Twin attended the first hearing of the trial held at Bakırköy 5th Heavy Criminal Court.
The defendant, Abbas Şahin, presented four pages of defence to the court.
"My wife asked me to help her get a fresh start.
When we met, he asked me to get a house, but not to know where the house was.
I lost control and pulled out the gun that was with me.
Meanwhile, my wife took the wheel.
The car went sideways, and the gun went off.
My wife fell on my arm.
Then I took him to the clinic.
I regret it."
If we agree, he'll be on every case.
"My daughter was 14 when she got married.
