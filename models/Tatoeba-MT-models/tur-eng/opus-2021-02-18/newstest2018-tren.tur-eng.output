Breaking news: cosmic visitor giant asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions of giant meteorites loose in the solar system that can cause serious consequences when it hits.
These objects, which can have closed or open orbits from the formation of the Sun, can sometimes travel through the Earth.
The 650-metre-wide asteroid, 2014, a visitor like this, will pass through 1.75 million miles from Earth at 2:24 p.m. today.
We've become more and more familiar with this kind of news.
The most important reason for this is progress in observation techniques and observation devices.
So we can also identify smaller asteroids that have never been detected before.
Last January, for example, an asteroid the size of a bus passed only half the distance between Earth and Moon (~250,000 km).
And what's even more interesting is that the asteroid was only detected a few days before the transition.
I mean, there could be other cosmic buses coming at us right now.
Imagine what you'd do if you heard that an asteroid within 20 meters of you would fall right in the middle of your neighborhood.
Actually, asteroids this size won't destroy your neighborhood, but they'll probably blow up all the windows in the building.
That would be due to shock waves from the asteroid that will explode in the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that fell to Russia in 2013 was in these dimensions, and it was enough to tear down the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you have a neighborhood within 100 yards of an asteroid, your advice is to go at least 50 kilometers from your neighborhood.
Qualities such as the size of the asteroid and the angle of impact are the depth of the crater and the damage that impact will cause.
Let's look at a few scenarios according to the simulation of the European Space Agency.
If an asteroid within a 100 m radius hits Earth at a 45 degree angle at 60 km per second, it forms a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and a diameter of over 1,200 meters.
The impact is the equivalent of an earthquake with a magnitude of six on the Richter scale, and even if you're 10 kilometers from the impact point, you get third-degree burns on your body.
And 50 kilometers away, they'll be waiting for smashed window windows.
If an asteroid a mile in diameter hits, the situation becomes even more depressing.
If an asteroid like this hits the Earth with the same angle and speed value, it forms a crater about 600 meters deep and 12 kilometers in diameter.
So a whole neighborhood turns into a crater and disappears instantly.
Because of the heat caused by the impact, even if you're 100 kilometers from the impact point, you get third-degree burns on your body.
Multiply is equivalent to an earthquake at 8 on the Richter scale.
The damage to the asteroid is not only dependent on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also on the rock structure of the area it's going to hit.
The above values are based on the scenario that occurs when a solid rock-like asteroid falls into an area of solid rock rock.
If the asteroid is mostly made of iron, if it falls to a surface that has a surface of lava cooling, then the crater size will increase by three times, and the disaster that occurs depending on that will be endured.
66 million years ago, something worse happened to the dinosaurs and they were subjected to a catastrophic impact by an asteroid about 10 km in diameter.
75 percent of sea and land creatures were instantly destroyed by asteroid impact.
If a large asteroid that destroys dinosaurs targeted Earth, the most solid option would be to leave the planet.
There's tons of matter falling from space to Earth every day.
Most of them burn up in the atmosphere.
Some asteroids, large enough, burn in the atmosphere, causing flares known as star slides among the public.
Let's end our article with another piece of news that's a relief.
Studies show that for the next 300 to 400 years, a massive asteroid is not expected to hit the Earth.
I'm sure you're a little relieved by the average 70-year-old species.
Flash for Medel: 10 million euros!
The black and white people who want to reinforce the Stoper area, the name on their agenda is Gary Medel, who is considered certain to be leaving Inter.
The 30-year-old footballer, who recently resumed his work with Inter, is on vacation after playing for the Confederate Cup in Chile. He expects offers.
Gazzetta dello Sport, a prestigious Italian newspaper, suggested Besiktaş made a 10m-euro offer to Inter for Mesel, who can serve in both the stoper and the front libero region.
The Black-Whites, who presented their proposal to Memel, were told to expect answers from both sides, while the Chilean footballer said he was sympathetic to living with his family in Istanbul.
Despite Gazzetta's claim, it is difficult for Black Eagle, the FFP limit, to pay a price like 10m euros for Medel.
Black-Whites may be able to move to Medel via lease, as they did in Caner Erkin's transfer, or recruit the star player in case of a serious discount on his bonus.
Beşiktaş reports the transfer of Negredo to the stock market
Human rights group issued travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Progress of Colored People has issued a warning for people of color to travel to Missouri for discrimination and racial attacks of the state.
The group's statement reads: "The MAACP Travel Advise of the state of Missouri recommends that African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri take special care as they travel from the beginning of the province, as noted there, because recent suspicious racial-based events have occurred throughout the state," said the group.
NAACP said a new Missouri law has made it difficult for people to win discrimination cases, while it is also effective for the group to issue this travel warning that the state's law practices target minorities in disproportionately.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin," said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP to Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints we've never heard before."
This is the first time the association has issued such a warning for a state in the United States.
The group cited racial insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders was arrested earlier this year by the Missouri police and died under suspicious circumstances after he ran out of fuel as he passed through the state.
The recommendation also points to a new report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office that shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than white people.
"The statement is for people to be alert and warn their families, friends and colleagues that they may be in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be ready to bring bail money with them, "tell their relatives they're going through this state."
In Missouri, according to the latest figures in the FBI's hate crime reporting programme, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, which put the state in 16th place in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning also responds to a new Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to sue a workplace for discrimination when renting or hiring.
For Texas and Arizona, the American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) has issued travel advice after the local executive authorities passed immigration laws ordering people to arrest for immigration violations; the ACLU says it will increase the practice of race.
Travel warnings are usually published by the State Department for other countries, but recently defence groups have applied to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba in Beşiktas.
Demba Ba, who was transferred to Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million euros two seasons ago and rented to the Black-Whites during the period of last season, is returning to Beşiktaş for free.
Last week, the Black Eagle asked for a detailed health report from the Senegalian player, followed by the report from the star football player.
The Black-White administration, which the Chinese representative did not think about next season, began working for the 32-year-old player, knocked on the Shanghai team's door.
Not written to list
Demba Ba, who was not listed for foreign status in China, told the administration that he wanted to return to the Black-Whites.
The Chinese team has approved the separation of the 32-year-old player.
Senegalian football player is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days to sign the official contract.
Castillo was operated on in Trabzonspor.
"Our post-op player, conducted by Prof. Dr. Uður Rights, is expected to start training with the team within four weeks," the Bordo-blue club said on its website.
Castillo was injured by his right rear muscle in a training match with the Dutch team Heerenveen at the burgundy-blue camp in Slovakia.
The Colombian player, announced to be away from the field for three or four weeks due to treatment, was also scheduled to be operated on due to his previous meniscus problem.
Barzan's referendum exit!
Barzani gave a speech at the memorial ceremony in Duhok, on the 3rd anniversary of DEAŞ's attack on Ezidis in Sincar district.
"I regret to say this, we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and proper country," Barzani said in his speech, referring to the independence referendum that the ICTY wants to hold on September 25th.
We've tried all the roads with Iraq, but we're completely helpless and desperate.
Our past experiences with Iraq have put us in this position, and there's no guarantee that we can take our rights and be protected.
That's why we need to show the world that we can all decide our fate through a referendum to ensure life and safety together.
And I have to emphasize that the referendum is not a goal for us, but it is a tool for us to achieve a greater goal.
Barzani, who reminded the Iraqi central government that the Kurds made many promises after Baas Regime was destroyed in 2003, said that soon after the disaster in Sincar, a direct referendum was decided after the fight with the DEAS.
"It has come to light with the documents that Iraq cannot protect or protect us like a state can't," Barzani said, saying, expressing that it wants to determine its fate peacefully and democratically for the protection and development of the citizens of the ICTY.
"He doesn't want us to move forward." He defended his point of view.
Barzani, who reacted that the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons during the war against the terrorist organization DEAŞ, but that the Hashdi Shabi, founded with a fatwa, was immediately legalised and all weapons were supplied, noted:
In Iraq's defense system, Peshmerge was not dealt with.
The central government did not do what it offered Hashdi Shabi to Peshmerge.
Peshmerge is considered part of Iraq's defence system according to the constitution.
However, with Hashdi Shabi no longer in the constitution, laws have been broken and all possibilities have been mobilized.
We're not saying we're against Hashdi Shabi.
Peshmerge and Hashdi Shabi fought on the same front, so why is Hashdi Shabi legalised on the one hand, while Peshmerge's presence and the fight against terrorism covered up.
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On August 3, 2014, the terrorist organization, DEAŞ launched an attack on Ezidis in Sincar district of Musul, killing many people including women and children.
10 minutes back from the disaster.
According to BBC news, the Air France flight Boeing 777 was located west of Hokkaido, north of Japan, while North Korea's missile was airborne.
Officials reported that the missile crashed in the area where the plane was located 10 minutes ago, saying the missile was estimated to be within 100-150km of the plane.
Air France reported that the missile did not intercept the plane's course and that there was no problem with the flight.
"The information we have at this point shows that the missile fell more than 100km off the plane's course into the sea," the statement said.
Is nothing sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most precise sign of regime change is that they start attacking statues.
The Americans know as much about this as any, as it is, that Saddam Hussein, carefully staged, was toppled in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003...
Stephen Miller, one of the key theorists of the Trump regime, knew exactly what he was doing when CNN's Jim Acosta and the president were symbolically destroying the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate over their proposals to strictly restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
If he did, he'd be lynched by a bunch of boatmen and Freedom impersonators.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially after 17 years after the monument itself was completed in 1903, Emma Lazarus' famous poem was added to the memorial base, which was attributed to her.
"I don't want to talk about history from beginning to end here, but the Statue of Liberty is the ridiculous symbol of American freedom for the world.
The poem you spoke of was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller's actually right, but as he said himself, it's not really about history.
This is about the modern echo of Lazarus' eerie words, which is not only a state that invites not only some elderly immigrants, but also the poor of the poor: "Tired, poor, / stuffed masses are desperate to take a breath of freedom, / the miserable undesirable land."
There's never been a time when the "unwanted" was so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't bring a literary review, which would explain why people weren't welcome in Trump's United States.
The conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: this is actually a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus and his friends who campaigned to put his words on the bottom of the statue after his death knew very well that they were taking a very political action.
The statue intended to celebrate the links between the French and the American republic by representing it in a trite metaphor, by representing the creation of Liber8 in the form of a woman.
Lazarus changed that meaning: In his poem, the figure of a woman was no longer abstract; she had a voice.
And he gives himself a very different name: Mother of the Banished.
The poem's marriage to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American anti-immigrantism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have wanted to change it back for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, a big-time Baptist John type for Trump's arrival, argued that Liber8 didn't invite anyone in in 2010, but was a neocon of early times that kept American fire in the dark.
It's to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Not to light the way to the United States of America."
Unusually, Limbaugh actually discovered something.
The image was all about perception.
Lazarus' magnificent creative act was to see it as being seen after long and often terrible journeys by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people on the decks of ships.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for shelter and trying to improve their lives.
His statue responded to them with words of hope and a warm welcome that they needed to hear.
Of course, that's not a perspective that Miller and Trump will find justified in any way.
Their torch is not to guide, but to provoke their only source of power, their hatred.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle only remembers when two Scots made the Great Britain team.
United Kingdom Athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-member Scottish group in the World Championships will "a huge contribution" to the team.
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which began on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that UK athletics should learn from it.
"We embrace it, and we try to understand it, and we will work until we get out of it," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish Athletics thinks it's about what they're doing.
British athleticism: He thinks it has something to do with what they do.
So's the guy on the street around the corner.
Whatever the combination of conditions, it's absolutely wonderful."
Laura Muir and many Scottish athletes, including Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 metres, are running for the medal, while Eilidh Doyle was named captain of the squad.
"Eilidh is a bit modest.
The captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"No matter where they live or train, a few athletes came out of that room very proud and really motivated.
The passion and true feeling that Eilidh naturally added was wonderful."
Silver medalist from the League of Nations, who will compete 400m in the fifth World Championships, says it is "unbelievable" for 16 Scots to be on the British team.
Scotland's top total athlete in the previous world championships was the seven achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The leader of the mid-range runner Muir, who broke five British and two European records last year.
He's going to join us at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Chris O'Hare is another Scotsman who's had a very good season, including the British Team trials and the triumphs of the Year-cycle Games, who's running at 1500 m.
Doyle remembers his first time as Lee McConnell, the only other Scotsman on the team.
The team captain says he is "very proud" in his move, as many of his compatriots will not only enter the team but will compete for the medal in some cases and will fight for the finals.
"The special thing about being captain of the team was that it was voted by other members of the team, so it was already a great honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me," he added.
" Frankly, I'm proud of all the Scots on the team.
That's how far we've come.
And they're here, as self-proven athletes, as athletes watching over the podium.
As for the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we're very lucky in this situation, in a way that we have a World Championship in our home.
I mean, it's really just the impact of being able to take advantage of this inner-field support and the fact that we're back at Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to get up there and fight, and there's going to be such a great atmosphere."
Obstructing critics on Facebook: If you can't handle voters' criticism, don't run for state office
Our country's father had some knowledge of negative press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start critical of everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was disturbed by the criticism.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Free speech can be eliminated and we can be dragged to slaughter in a stupid and silent manner."
Which brings me to Larry Hogan, governor of Maryland, who needs to work harder to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the sharing of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Association sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff didn't care about the case as a matter of fact, and online comments were full of "who cares?" reactions.
A lot of people said, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
When you're like Hogan, it's especially important.
It's a Republican governor who's surprisingly popular in a state that's mostly Democratic.
He has the second highest approval rate of 50 governors in the country.
Hogan's not a reactionary flare.
He has mastered his province and strict devotion to principles.
He was also very good at using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his constituents, when he introduced his hairless head as a prankster after chemo.
So it's unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to stop people from coming to the Governor's page, which is a public forum, which is officially described as a public tax dollars, which is run by staff members.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than organizing them.
But it's easy to use images of trolls or spamists or haters attacking online verbally.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were prevented by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a priest; not trolls.
They all said your comments weren't respectful, thoughtful, and abusive.
In his share, the priest spoke to Hogan's Catholic faith and quoted a Bible quote.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Maryland Bowie was not hateful, but he asked about hate crimes.
He wrote in The Post's comment section, "In a kind way, I made a statement that I was disappointed that he had failed to respond to his hate crimes and other recent news."
"I also don't like the idea of being ignored as a so-called collective effort rather than a large group of concerned citizens when many people comment on the same subject."
What the governor's staff calls a "intensive spam attack", others will probably call it "concentration of ideas."
The Facebook era makes it easy for a message to be adapted through obstruction of a dissident or deletion of a negative message.
It's much cleaner than the old days when the staff was sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical writings or to arrest and silence protesters.
But, even digitally, that's exactly what happened.
Hogan is not the first public mission criticised for neutralising Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter.
One of the decisions that could be a reference to this issue came from Virginia last week.
According to US District Judge James C. Cacheris, the chairman of the Loudoun Region of Administrative Affairs Council acted contrary to the First Amendment when it banned a voter on Facebook.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republicist) was visited by the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the fair-priced postage period had a very similar effect on the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers was fourfold, and anonymous letterwriters were wearing out his leadership.
Even then, Washington had unknown trolls.
People who used nicknames such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to the newspapers that brought Washington's decisions under their feet.
According to the George Washington Articles Project, which collected historical documents, petitions criticised his position with Britain on the Friendship, Trade and Navigation Agreement.
But he didn't shut them up.
Freedom of expression, dissidentism and requisite is at the core of our nation.
That's what real leadership means to accept.
Ronan Rafferty hopes you'll be comfortable at the Renaissance Club.
In the next three days, the Renaissance Club in South Lothian will be at ease while Scottish Senior Open hosts its 25th edition.
Before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, the next door leads the North Irish to the final, feeling committed to the new venue, and acting on behalf of the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvadi, as ambassador to the tournament.
"I watched the construction of the Renaissance Club, and we see that it has achieved its glory with this organisation," Rafferty said.
The players will see the field in its best form, in a remarkable state.
Jerry did a fantastic job setting this place up.
He's a relentless advocate of this game, and he's proud of his success here.
It's a great show for this field."
Although the British Eales won both the Europen Tour and the European Challenger Tour, he will face the first time in his 32-year career in defending a championship.
"This feels really special," said Southport-based actor.
"I didn't get a chance to protect Extremadura Open because it was removed from the calendar after the year I won.
It's good to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
It brings back memories from last year, and it was very special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a real special time, and we'll always be fond of it."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour at the beginning of his 50th birthday this year, is returning to the game in his own field.
The event will be the first Scottish competition since 2013's Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"It always means a little bit more when you fight inside," Helensburgh Man Orr said.
"You want to do well, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and played some real golf.
I'm happy to be gone till now."
The three in the field are former Masters champions Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are six Scots in the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The turnout is free and there is a parking lot; £5 per car with one person and £10 per car with two or more.
All the profits go to Prostate Cancer UK.
I found the answer.
Think of a "column" budget: with 6 billion 867 million Turkish liras, more than any ministry, including Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism Ministry!
The number of staff is 117,378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the President of the Religious Affairs!
Yes, I'm going to talk about the President of the Religious Affairs Mehmet Don't See!
For days... I've been looking for answers to the question in my head...
I wonder why Mehmet Gormaz was removed from his seat.
I've read every article about her being sent.
Nope.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
It's only early this year...
Mehmet Gormez prepared the Strategic Plan 2017-2021 of the Department of Religious Affairs (DIB).
The S 600-pound Mercedes was pulled under by President Erdogan.
So he was okay with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You can say, "He's served seven years, isn't that enough?"
The first head of the DİB, M. Rıfat Pieçi, served for 17 years.
As you all know, Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz sat in that chair for 11 years.
So... the President's term is clear.
Back to my question: why did Mehmet Gözr leave his seat?
It's back to square one...
Shiite closeness
Close to the power source said, "According to the traditional reach, the people of Mehmet Agerez did not have the circumcision!"
The code for this sentence is that he didn't have the circumcision!
The person who put that sentence behind him said, "He's been found modernist by the traditional Ulema!"
I mean, Mehmet Seer was being seen as innovative.
What does that mean, innovation?
The answer to the question was hidden on a trip abroad by Mehmet Gormez.
The date is December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Gormez went to Iran to attend the 29th Wahidet Conference, which will be held in Tehran, aimed at zooming in on Islamic sects.
He met with the religious leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
And he stood up in ranks with the men of the Shia.
And at the conference, he said, "The cults are human schools that represent different ideas and opinions in the understanding of Islamic religion.
To God belongs their purpose.
Each one is in the middle of the main road, but their destination is the same.
It is unacceptable to associate religion with religion or to view sectarianism above Islamic belonging.
Separation based on sectification is a reflection of otherness and conflict, of Taassubun and ignorance.
The religion that was most damaged when the sects came to the forefront of religion itself...
And I want to emphasize that again by underline:
Shies and Sunnis are one nation...
"No one can inseminate another because he understands Islam as he understands it."
A year later...
Only Jahaferi leader Selahattin attended the 30th Wahidet Meeting in Turkey in the original day.
I mean...
It's not circumcision. It's Vehhabinik.
Mehmet Gormez's visit to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of the "traditional reach".
That's why no one -- again -- represented the Turkish State at the next Tehran conference.
He's already been invited four times since Mehmet Ghaz took office.
The reason was obvious: Shiite - anti-Iranian "traditional reach!"
Right after the visit to Iran, Mehmet Görmaz's seat began to be worn out from the beginning of 2016.
Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş was in charge of the DİB!
Mehmet Gözmaz drowned so much, he wanted "to be linked to the DİB presidency".
In essence...
There was a difference within the government about looking at circumcision.
Some of the theoretical worlds created in Saudi Arabia and Egypt were associated with the "traditional ulna", the Sunnicism -- in the U.S. shadow -- with Vehhabi-Salefism!
These were anti-Granians who couldn't stand the trip to Tehran.
"There has never been any danger to the religion."
And that my Lord may give to the people of the land a good leader, and to the people who are truthful.
They used "Ehlisinine" as a symbol of Iranian hostility.
There was a time when the FETÖ -- the CIA-backed anti-Iranian -- was now under new names.
And with the FETÖ schemes...
A picture of a young man with a whiskey in his hand was sent to the media with a lie about "The Son of Mehmed Don't Know"!
What a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Gormez in the media: Turkey's newspaper of the U.S.-led Lighters Community!
In the end...
- The one who resists bringing circumcision to the Saudi Vehhabi-Selfi line...
- That doesn't fuel the sect...
- Modernist... a clergyman, whose consciousness was destroyed by the "traditional reach" created during the Cold War...
U.S. cultural imperialism continues to Arabise Turkey rapidly (and make it vehhabi-Selefi).
Do not doubt that the future president of the Dialogues will be a representative of the Vehhabi-Elelefi!
"We support Turkey's protection of sovereignty"
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu has gone to China to make an official visit.
Çavuşoğlu and Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi held a joint press conference at the State Hospital in Beijing in the capital.
"We hope Turkey will be more active in international affairs," Vang said.
China will support Turkey in efforts to maintain sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that the Palestinian issue will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey," he said.
Çavuşoğlu said "Turkey, in search of close co-operation with regional and international organisations, international organisations are complementary, not alternatives to each other".
The spirit is officially starting its second term.
The presidency of Hasan Ruhani, which won the May presidential elections in Iran, was approved by the country's leader, Ayatullah Ali Hamaney.
Hasan Ruhani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, took an oath at the ceremony attended by the country's religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
Turkish Ambassador to Tehran Reza Hakan Tekin attended the ceremony, attended by top military and political names as well as foreign representatives.
Ruhani, who will serve as president for another four years, will officially take office Saturday (August 5th) after an oath ceremony in parliament.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekchi, representing Turkey, is expected to attend the ceremony.
Security measures at the border gate
Trucks carrying supplies, other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine, cleaning materials, will not be allowed to pass through the Cilve Eye Border Gate in Reyhanlı district of Hatay.
According to reports, Cilveve Eye has been closed to transports outside the Border Gate, humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning clause, due to the negative security conditions at the Babel Air Border Gate and its region, near the Turkish border.
And the exit of the relief trucks at the border gate is allowed.
No information has been given as to how long the limitation will take.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Land
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove when she cooks.
In fact, he rarely uses a pot.
The housewife puts a sweet potato, usually known as "nota", directly on the fire in Papua, Indonesia, in the wood house of Enarotali, the regent of Paniai.
Half an hour later, the roasted lump is removed and wiped out with appetite, hands unwashed.
Degei is sitting on the muddy floor where he does chores, like doing laundry with a blur of water coming from the nearby swamp, and he has no furniture.
It's a bucket of Saharan toilets in a roofless house.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was never assigned a position in any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most men in the village are unemployed and many drink too much, and there are soldiers.
"No one goes around the village after 5 p.m."
A rare glimpse of daily life in the mountainous regions of Papua, a former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1026 seniors were forced to vote by public force before the invasion of troops.
An existing movement against the Dutch administration has directed its outrage against the Jakarta government, which quickly maintains strict control over the region, bans foreign journalists or rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the region officially separated as Papua and West Papua, where independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is, but the journey here includes a five-hour drive from the regional capital of Jaikura to Nabire, a 90-minute flight to Nabire, and a rented vehicle to the stomach.
No public transportation.
The town of 19,000 people contains wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, crumpled iron roofs transformed by rust into various yellowish brown shades.
Leave the journalists, very few Indonesians have traveled here and almost no foreigners have traveled here.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, he worshipped the Mee Pago Papuas, a god called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," he says, referring to his live, hand-tied turban, dark shirt and shiny skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest part of Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have the worst child death and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also the golden land of Indonesia.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles away from Paniai, a mountainous region the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced about $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua probably has $78 billion in lumber reserves.
However, these riches, which are a source of misery for the Papuans, enable Indonesia's powerful army to sustain a stifling presence.
The New York Times' 2005 research reports that Freeport paid about $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including about $150,000 to a single officer.
The Papuans' call for more autonomics threatens this golden spawning chicken and comes out of ruthless rights.
According to rights advocates, more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
In the mountains of Papua, mass killings in the 1970s reached the number of genocides according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful demonstrators in the area alone last year.
Brisbane Archdiocese's 2016 "We Will Lose Everything" report includes testimony of the advocacy, such as the previous year's illegal executions, torture (exclusively popular with rape and electricity), and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
Pressure has been raised since Papua's sources brought settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The region's population of 3.5 million people is 83% Christian, but the demographic changes as Muslim immigrants from the crowded islands of Indonesia come from Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi for economic reasons.
Javan warung buffets sell gado-gados served with fried chicken and vegetable peanut sauce.
Locals are having a hard time competing.
"Registers sell chickens and vegetables cheaper on traditional markets than local Papuaans," explains the 24-year-old Abeth You, a native of Paniai, who moved to the regional capital of Jaapura for work.
"It caused the local Papuans to lose their mama-mamas."
The Indonesian president Joko Widodo, more commonly known as Jokowi, pledged to solve the disparity and rights violations in Papua during the 2014 election campaign.
While the former carpenter was on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, he received 27 votes from the 29 regions of Papua, including Panaia.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, hoping that justice would be restored," You said.
In fact, Paniai suffered his worst condition only two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children broke through two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle, singing Christmas songs outside a bonfire in Enarotali.
The scared kids told them to turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers resented their style and then returned with four soldiers, according to local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Victims and witnesses said that the soldiers who were drinking alcohol chased the group and beat them with their rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers fired on the children's group.
One of the children, Yulianus Yeomo, 16, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire, and the next day, events escalated.
About 1,000 Papuaan men, women and children gathered to demand justice in a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and danced the Waita dance of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and the military garrison.
"If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them and kill them," said an official document seen by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the impending danger and demanded peace by calling the crowd to return home.
No one had any intention of listening.
On the porch of his brightly painted wooden house, he told TIME, "I turned around and suddenly I was shot in the left wrist."
He still doesn't know who fired the shot, but he says that the bullet came from a assembled army.
"It was crowded, shots fired many times," he adds.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the attacks, local Alfius Youw was shot three times.
Like many Indonesians, Yohanes, known only by one name, said to TIME, "I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it wasn't him."
"I saw him die, I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende explained to reporters that his officers were only "protecting the outpost" because the police station was under attack.
"When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves," said Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistio, director of the department.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
News of the deaths only reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made an enthusiastic speech in Jaikura, stating that he shares the pain of his victims' families and promising to solve historical abuses in Papua.
He said, "I want this case solved immediately so there's no future."
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he set up an illegal mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some in the '90s and some in the early 2000s.
The issue is that we are determined to resolve these violations, but we have processes to go through," he said.
Speaking to TIME on June 5th, Wiranto backed down saying there was no plan to build a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It will all be solved by the law."
Wiranto, who B.M. accused of "crimes against humanity" over 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said 11 human rights violations in Papua have already been solved.
The families of the Paniai victims met such claims with bitter skepticism.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
He says, "I'm scared."
"I'm afraid of being arrested by a soldier, afraid of getting shot."
His brother Yacobus repeats his view of the people in Paniai as being afraid to discuss it.
He says he was beaten by a soldier after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the soldier came looking for me," he says.
The attacks haven't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers at the Deiyai regentate, a neighbour of Paniai.
One person was killed and 17 others, including children, were injured during the conflict between villagers and the director of a construction company who refused to help a man be taken to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's construction office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the officers, and they reacted by firing warning shots.
But the locals say that the mobile brigade opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
Dominggu Badii, 29, who lived close to the hospital and witnessed the raising of the wounded, tells TIME, "We were so panicked, we were afraid of revenge."
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament called for the responsibility of the officers involved and the moving police brigade to withdraw from the area.
Paniai has always been a troubled area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development fuels the dissatisfaction of the peoples of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live scattered throughout Papua's green mountain centre.
Many claimed to be protecting the rights of the Papuans by random attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers. The rebel army joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM).
Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas come from Paniai, some of the top OPM leaders, including Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and have been held at ease by the soldier in recent years under the cover of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some are never seen again.
Among the Papua people, Paniai is known as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Poorness feeds discontent.
A little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for natives to buy.
The bread is unreachable.
People here grow everything they eat: basically some fruit and leafy vegetables, as well as some notes.
Farming is the work of women who can survive four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and they sell the rest in the local market.
10 notes is only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In time, economic inequality among the local Papuans and the new arrivals of new immigrants has grown since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
Fewer jobs usually go to immigrants who are better educated and richer.
The Papuans rarely have capitalism or the necessary qualifications to run their own business competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, head of the Panai tribal council.
The isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
Furthermore, the restrictions on reporting for international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were deported from Papua for "a lack of co-ordination with relevant institutions", despite the rare permission to shoot video.
According to Human Rights Watch Assistant Asian Director Phelim Kine, Jokowi's election campaign has not been met with the commitments to remove and develop news restrictions to increase transparency.
He said in a statement: "There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from the restless eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua: visa rejection and blacklisting."
The lack of press inspection means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to its neighbours near Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) encouraged the U.M. Human Rights Council to investigate "diversity and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries historically support the OPM.
"There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and free media, so the evidence in human rights cases is hard to cover," Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir told reporters in Jakarta.
The locals want more foreign governments to take care of it.
An official delegation from the Netherlands violated its silence when it visited Jaikura on May 4th, led by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, according to a source who attended the meeting and didn't want to be named.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say it's unlikely they'll ever vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack," said Gobai, head of the tribal council.
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that, apart from living under the threat of a violent soldier, he's fallen into a different state of mind with limited education and health care.
Like other Papuaans, Gobai says, the people of Paniai consider their vote a "loan" to pay Jokowi back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai attack committed a last symbolic act of resistance: Do not bury a victim's body on the property opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be done, they will at least make sure that those responsible do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was murdered," says Yacobus, with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
The fire has surrounded Dubai's Torch for the second time.
On Friday in Dubai, a fire swept through the world's tallest residential towers and forced hundreds of residents to flee the 79-story structure, 337 meters long.
This is the second big fire that spread rapidly into the tall building called the Torch tower in two years.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries reported, and no explanation has been made as to the cause of the big fire.
"We were asleep, and we woke up to the fire alarm, and people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about 10 minutes to reach the 50th floor," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities say the fire brigade put out the big fire at around 4:00 a.m. local time and is cooling the building.
The government said they were trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This can raise questions about the security of materials used in the outer parts of high - level buildings worldwide.
An investigation by the torch management following the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage was in the casings, or in the outer panels used for decoration and isolation.
Police in the United Kingdom say they believe that London's isolation and hull panel system on the Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June.
News of 'social assistance' for more than 4,000 chronic patients
The Ministry of Family and Social Policies will benefit 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients from the programme on welfare for poor citizens and their families, which are struggling with chronic diseases.
The Ministry, which plans to provide patients with monthly support over two-thirds of the minimum wage through the aid programme, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to information, the details and implementation of the "New Social Aid Programme for Chronic Families", which began a while ago, under the direction of Family and Social Policies Minister Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, have been established.
The social aid programme, initiated by the Ministry of Health for the support of citizens struggling with chronic diseases, struggling with economic and psychological difficulties, is also, in many ways, the first in the world.
Completing all preparations for the programme's launch, the Ministry will provide not only cash but regular psychosocial support for families with its outreach programme.
It aims to ensure that poor citizens and their families, who have chronic illness and who continue their treatments in their homes, are not left alone financially and spiritually.
According to studies, poor citizens struggling with Subakut Sklerozan Panensephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and measles, will receive regular psychosocial and cash as part of the new social aid programme.
Further stages of the programme will be covered by the poor citizens' aid programme, which deals with other rare and risky diseases.
In addition to the support planned to be paid at over two-thirds of the minimum wage, there can also be additional payment for tuberculosis patients, who are not able to afford medical self-care, who are dependent on bed, or who are determined to improve home living conditions.
In order to benefit from the support, the household requires that the minimum monthly salary per person be less than two thirds of the monthly net amount.
In addition, citizens who suffer from SSPE must have a health board report based on the procedures and principles outlined in the "Edictions on Disabilities, Classification, and Health Board Reports for Disabilities".
According to the survey, more than one of the five US passengers is bringing banned substances to the plane.
According to a survey with airline passengers, more than 20 per cent deliberately or unknowingly smuggled restricted materials from the US Transportation Security Service checkpoints, including at least 6 per cent carrying banned knives or other sharp objects.
Less than one percent later claimed to have discovered that he was traveling by accident with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
Research conducted by the Stratos Jet Charters, with more than 1,000 people, has also found younger passengers more likely to break the rules.
Among those participants who admit to deliberately trying to fly with something forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 per cent are Y-generations, but fewer than 15 are members of the X-generation.
The most common substances taken from TSA agents on purpose are food and fluids.
More than 3 per cent have knowingly admitted that they have experienced sharp instruments from security, while 2.2 per cent of female participants and 3.7 per cent of male participants have deliberately admitted to carrying banned drugs on board.
The firm said that several people from airport security accidentally brought contraband and surveyed passengers across the country to find out how many did it on purpose.
It's not a surprise that, on purpose or unknowingly, the most likely people to pass contraband through security are the most flying.
However, as the firm pointed out, TSA rules are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain about what liquids or how much of them they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of material confiscated by the TSA was released as banned liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Fluids are allowed in domestic flights, but international ones are not allowed in.
China welcomes US statements
At a press conference in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi said Tillerson's remarks to Pyongyang administration "We are not looking for an excuse to change the regime, collapse the regime, quickly regroup the peninsula and send our troops north of the 38th parallel".
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang said that Tillerson's administration emphasised Washington's principles on the North Korean issue again, hoping the United States will implement them effectively and in a concrete policy.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is priorities, Vang stressed that they expect the parties to find a way to resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, while Beijing's administration has been persistently insisting on the removal of the peninsula from nuclear, maintaining peace and stability, resolving problems through dialogue and negotiations.
EPA President Pruitt Stops Delaying Obama-era Emivation Laws
The day after he was sued by 15 states, EPA head Scott Pruitt withdrew his decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era laws, which had previously reduced air pollutant emissions that caused the dirty smoke.
Pruitt represented change by his organisation's sensitivity to the needs of the state environmental regulators.
He never mentioned a legal objection to his previous position in a federal supreme court.
The provinces are starting to meet October 1st, which is the end of 2015 standards for ozone ground level.
Pruitt announced to his organisation that he would postpone June compatibility by one year to give his plan more time to work and to avoid "intervening local decisions or preventing economic growth".
Before he was appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, the state's attorney general of Oklahoma, served as a trusted ally against stricter environmental regulations for a long time.
Ever since Pruitt arrived in Washington, he's acted repeatedly to prevent or delay regulations against chemistry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change is Pruitt's latest legal defeat for the regression agenda.
Last month, a federal supreme court in Washington ruled that the EPA executive's attempt to delay and reduce the methane spills of oil and gas companies, an Obama administration law, was a violation of its own authority.
His return to ozone standards only strengthens the EPA's commitment to meet new standards on time with the provinces and to work through complex processes, Pruitt said in a statement released Wednesday evening.
Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA often fails to meet the final dates of decisions, waits to be sued by activist groups and others and agreed to settle the dispute to set the timing for the decision."
"We don't believe in arranging by means of prosecution, and we take the dates of the term seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously."
However, the EPA's statement said Pruitt could once again use "the power to delay" and "all the other legal powers" to ensure that regulations are "supported by sound policies and the best information available".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider rewrite of the ozone laws.
A parliamentary bill approved last month is trying to delay the implementation of 2015 laws for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate for a vote.
New York chief prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The EPA's change of resolution after our cases is an important gain for the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by 6.7 million New Yorkers and the dirty smoke that flows directly into their communities."
The case participated in New York from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington of Columbia.
The ozone at ground level is produced by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical facilities and other sources responding to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The smog can cause serious breathing problems in a group of affected people, and it contributes to thousands of early deaths every year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise change of decision.
Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity said, "It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this discreet step from the person in charge of protecting the air we breathe."
"We must continue to fight against the ideological struggle of the Trump administration, "of polluting the environment and snogging interest groups."
Inflation single digits
Turkey, which received the biggest increase in exports in July, drew unemployment by 13 per cent in January to 10.5 per cent in April, and rose to the top of the economic trust index of 3.5 years, reduced inflation to one household.
The Consumer Price Index (TEFE) rose by 0.15 per cent in July, while annual inflation dropped to one household for the first time since 9.79 per cent since January, according to data released yesterday by Turkey's Statistics Institute (TÜİK).
As of main spending groups in July, the highest monthly increase was 1.75 per cent in the restaurant and hotels group, while the most decline was 3.51 per cent in clothing and shoes.
The highest annual year-on-year increase took place in the transport group at 15.24 per cent.
"There is an impact on lower prices of food and clothing groups in the moderate movement in inflation," said Business Investment economist Muammer Coalcuoglu, who noted in July that inflation has dropped to one household in parallel to expectations.
But unlike the headline, the core indicators are elevated compared to the previous month.
"We don't expect any relief from the firm position of the Central Bank," he said.
Despite the decline in headline inflation, core inflation indicators have risen.
The B index rose from 9.07 per cent in July to 9.46 per cent from 9.20 per cent to 9.60 per cent from the special comprehensive TEFE indicators the Central Bank watched closely.
Capital FX Research Assistant Enver Erkan said inflation could be closed at 9.3 per cent of the year, adding that "inflation could be fluctuated by December and fall into one household in December."
"The Central Bank may have an opportunity as of the first months of 2018," he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek: He will close the inflation year with a single digit.
The Central Bank's tightening will continue until inflation drops below 7 per cent.
We're going to put the reforms in their final form at the nearby Food Committee.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci: We are glad that inflation has fallen to a single-digit number, but this has to become permanent.
In the fight against inflation, food prices need to be reduced, as well as supply needs to be increased.
Development Minister Lütfi Elvan: Due to its base effect in the coming months, there may be some upward trends in annual inflation, but from the early months of 2018, inflation will be marked.
We expect annual inflation to go even lower.
I wish Fenerbahçe good luck in their next match.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said their performance in the second half was not enough to skip the lap in the 3rd qualifying round of UEFA European League with Fenerbahce.
"We couldn't use the wings in the first half," Foda said at a press conference after the encounter, stating that Fenerbahçe was a top-level team.
In the second half, we set the balance in the game.
We got a chance to score a second goal.
I'm still proud of my team.
They changed the course of the game in the second half.
We could do a little better.
During the game, small things became decisive.
"I wish Fenerbahçe good luck in their next match," he said.
As long as they are in Turkey, she said, they feel very well and are happy with their hospitality.
Fernando is in Istanbul
Brazilian football player Fernando Francisco Reges, where the Galatasaray Club began its transfer talks, arrived in Istanbul.
The fans welcomed the Brazilian footballer who arrived at Atatürk Airport.
Fernando, where the yellow-red fans cheered for love, left the airport under security.
Fernando, 30, who started his career on Brazil's Vila Nova team, wore Estrela Amadora, Porto, and Manchester City, is in midfield.
The Brazilian football player is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after his medical examination.
Galatasaray, who has been working on the transfer, has reached a deal with Manchester City for five million and 250,000 euros for Fernando, whom he has long tried to recruit.
US flash Rakka move: Homeland Security Force...
Colonel Dillon, who has been linked to the US Defence Ministry (Pentagon) through video conference management from Baghdad, said that Rakka Homeland Security Force (RIGG) trained by the coalition has begun to settle in areas being cleared of DEAS in the city.
"The Rakka Homeland Security Force, mostly Arabs and local volunteers anti-DESR, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from escaping or returning," Dillon said.
Another 230 people completed their training this week and joined the group, Dillon said "the number of forces at this time is 850".
Dillon said the coalition was training the group on basic weapons training, as well as first aid, armed conflict, screening and checkpoint operations.
The coalition will continue to scan applicants for training and employment, Rakka said, adding that you are very interested in the Homeland Security Force.
The US-led coalition co-operates with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which form the PYD/PKKK's main backbone in the acquisition of Rakka.
PYD/PKK terror group appointed a PKK terrorist named Leyla Muhammad as co-chair of the Rakka civilian administration council.
The military force in Rakka allegedly includes members of the PKK/PYD.
Dillon also announced that the US-led coalition was gathering heavy weapons from a opposition group called Shaheda Karyayn (Shuhuk) at the El Tanif camp in southern Syria, where it cut off its support last week.
"After meeting with their leaders last week, Shuhuk returned the heavy arms and equipment the coalition had given them, but some small weapons and light vehicles were allowed to remain in them," Dillon said.
Last week, the United States announced that it had gone outside the non-conflict zones they had agreed on with Russia and had been patrolling and withdrawing its support from Shuhuk on the grounds that it was involved in activities that were not associated with the DEAŞ.
The group reportedly wants to fight the DEAŞ, as well as the regime of Bashar Esed.
According to the leaky phone call notes, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The notes of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were leaked by the Washington Post.
On January 27th, during a phone call with Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump pressed him not to publicly say he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States scolded the president of Mexico who held the wall publicly and said, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and promised Mexico would pay for the project.
His first meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which revealed a heated dialogue, was also published.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the agreement on the United States to take refugees to Australia is "stupid", "stupid" and "stupid", and that the agreement under Obama would make him look "stupid" after offering a ban to put a refugee in the United States.
Mr. Trump ended up saying to Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant conversation I've had all day."
The patient's relatives broke the doctor's nose.
Doctors and employees of Turkey's High Disciplinary Education and Research Hospital left short-term work yesterday morning in response to the battery of a fellow doctor by their relatives.
The crowd in front of the main entrance of the hospital with foreign exchanges marked "no violence in health", reacted to the incident.
The hospital's Children's Cardiology Clinic Chief Prof. Dr. Feyza Ayşenur Paç said, "No violence in health sounds like insufficient or even entity slogan to me."
There's no place for violence in health.
"If this continues, these people will soon find no health group to serve themselves," he said.
Ankara Provincial Health Director Dr. Kamil Türkmen, Ankara First District Public Hospitals Secretary-General Prof. Dr. Önder Odabas, Turkey’s High Intelligence Education and Research Hospital Chief Medicine Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and his relatives in the hospital garden also supported the action.
Condemning the incident, Paç said:
I'm afraid the violence against health workers is increasing.
We experienced an example of this yesterday (the previous day) evening when our cardiovascular surgeon was beaten by a patient's relative.
In order for these events to end quickly, we, our government, our ministry and our governorship, have taken all the precautions we can, but we demand that our people's sensitivity in this matter be increased.
I condemn yesterday's events on behalf of my hospital and medical staff.
"Unfortunately, this has become a professional complication that we have experienced from time to time," Odabas noted, noting that the public should be conscious of violence in health.
"We will take our own precautions, but most importantly, our nation will take care of its own health worker," he said.
"Our laws on violence in health were established effectively enough," Turkmen said, stating that the judicial process on the incident had begun.
That's what the government's ranks are doing.
Security's working now.
In the past, it's always been idle, but right now it's a direct public case, and the state's assigning a lawyer, and he's following the case.
He used the phrase "there are also severe punishment samples involved in this".
After the announcements, the employees continued their work.
The incident allegedly took place around 5:45 p.m. the other day.
The relatives of the patient who lost his life in intensive care attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Uzbek, who worked in the Heart and Damar Surgical Department, which reported his death.
Uzbek was suspended from the scene by doctors and assistants; the hospital called the police.
Uzbek’s nose was broken in the incident, while the attackers were taken into custody.
One of the witnesses said:
When our friend went to his relatives to inform them of the condition of a patient who had lost his life, the patient held our friend and us responsible for the situation and attacked two of our friends.
Our friend's nose is broken, he's covered in blood.
Then we took our friend into the O.R. and hid him.
We had security set up for 15 to 20 minutes.
If the patient's relatives had broken through that firewall, something much worse would have happened.
Heavy blow to DEAS in Gaziantep: 102 sacks...
According to information, the investigation carried out by Gaziantep Chief Public Prosecutor's Office has taken over 5,100kg of ammonium nitrate in an operation used to build explosives in an operation set out to be owned by the terrorist organization DEAŞ in Kayaönü neighbourhood as part of the investigation launched by Gaziantep Security Directorate Anti-Terror Branch.
In the operation where six people were detained, the suspects were taken into residence, workplaces, warehouses and top searches, plus 35 long-strength guns, 2,370 loaded rounds, 3,370 pistols, 7 cartridges and 382 loaded cartridges of this gun, 2 shotguns and 1 pair of machetes, 39,705 Euros and 15,870), the USD, a total of 163 thousand TLs, and a large amount of digital notebooks, and two digital notebooks were seized for each.
The search also found four books issued by FETÖ/PDY terrorist organisations and issued a decision to collect them.
Six people taken into custody were sent to the judicial authorities following their interrogations.
Suspects have been arrested by the Criminal Court of Peace on sentry duty.
The YPG raid in Syria...
US intervened
According to local sources, AA reports that the YPG terrorists looted the homes of residents of Tel Semin in the northern countryside of Rakka, where they entered on the basis of US military support on the basis of the war against the terrorist group DEAŞ.
The reaction of civilians whose homes were looted and confiscated turned into a conflict with the terrorist organization.
After that, US forces in the region entered the city in armored vehicles.
"Cougar MRAP" armoured vehicles, personnel carriers and Husky-type landmine detection vehicles have reportedly created a buffer zone in the town.
The terrorist group YPG does not allow civilians to enter the cities under its control in Rakka, under fire as part of the anti-DESC operation.
The local activist network "Rakka is being murdered quietly" announced yesterday, only in July that 121 civilians were killed in the group's artillery fire.
Let's not bring the old world's fights to tomorrow.
Delayed perception of dorms and world realities can lead to crisis, not to the commoners.
One of the reasons why the backward East perceives the world's realities by delay is because of the fact that these facts are reflected in the geography of the East by certain focals, or by the fact that they're being heard beyond reality.
Don Quixote and Oblomov have also been the subject of the literary world of delaying perception and perception of facts and change.
Cervantes' "Don Quixote" is an insane notion that he still thinks he is a knight when the bourgeoisie begins to form.
Or Gonçarov's "Oblomov" was a lazy man who thought that when he ignored the facts, things could go on the way they used to.
China, for example, was a land that was open to the world and dominated the seas until the end of the 15th century, when a conservative dynasty was enthroned.
It has lasted until the execution of the captains of the boats out of the Chinese landwater.
As for us Turks, one foot, one eye and ear in the West, the other foot, the eye and the ear in the East, we've had constant dilemmas about understanding reality and change starting with the Ottomans.
An old and new chapter of ours has tried to move yesterday into the present, to understand today, to think of yesterday as tomorrow, to understand the concepts that fit the old conditions.
One part of us was able to act as quickly as the thought centers in the developed countries to perceive the facts of the land and the world, as well as the reality of the world.
This has been a source of constant conflict, tension.
Medrese and the university, the neoscientist and the modern army, the encounters of doubt with faith, led to dramatic dualism.
Progress and even worse have not been accepted that new and advanced stances at one time will eventually wear out and remain behind.
Some of yesterday's progressives later declared "Dangerous", "Dangerous", and "Traitor", who tried to interpret home and world conditions in accordance with the current reality.
The most important lesson in the Ottomans was that those who delayed understanding the truths of home and worlds and finally dominated the thinking and state life, the empire fell apart, collapsed, and the people became poor.
The most important lesson that our Ottoman past passed on to the Republic was the fact that the quick perception of the world's conjuncture and change was an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Since this lesson has been well absorbed, so far from World War I, we have been the model country of this geography, which has managed to maintain its unity, integrity, stability in peace.
And in order to get through a different approach, we need to leave the memorization behind and act in harmony with the facts, so that we can get through the global change process safely and safely.
In other words, no one will benefit from carrying on meaningless camps and blood feuds that have caused our democracy to limp in the past.
Moreover, in today's world, the smallest mistakes lead to massive and dramatic crises.
And the most problematic geography of all is the Middle East that we're in.
Operation artifact in Muş
The Governorship said an operation was carried out by the Il Gendarmerie Command teams in connection with the smuggling of artifacts.

"For the peace and security of our people, our operations in the fight against crime and criminals will be carried out with determination."
Turkey wind
The global giants, counting on Turkey's future, fought hard at yesterday's wind plant tender.
The World's record was broken in a bid by the Ministry of Energy and Resources to reduce external dependency and ensure the transition to national energy.
An tender to lower Turkey's energy costs opened the way for $1 billion in investment and close to 4,000 jobs.
Local production wind turbines will be included in the system by the beginning of 2019.
Eight consortiums, including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants, participated in the tender on renewable resources (YEA) wind plant licenses opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
The tender opened first with financial proposal envelopes to determine the five lowest bidders.
After the initial bids, the minimum bid was $4.19/kiloat.
Open reduction range is set at 0.01 cents.
After the tender began, Enercon decided not to participate in the open reduction of joint venture groups, including Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas.
Groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed in the open reduction.
MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon were the last two after the consortium was withdrawn.
MingYang-First Construction took 11 stops.
Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon Energy consortium never took a break.
Minister of Energy and Resources Berat Albayrak: Record day for Turkey.
Open reduction continued 30 laps.
The winner of the intense competition between the two consortiums was the Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon joint venture group, which made the lowest bid with $3.48 cents/ kilowattt.
The consortium bided $3.49 per cent/kilovatate in the tender, and drew it to 3.48 at the request of the tender commission headed by Assistant Undersecretary Alparslan Bayraktar.
Turkey won a world record in the two-hour YEA tender.
The bid offered $3.48/cent was the world's lowest in this area.
The previous record was held by Mexico with $3.84/cent per kilowatt.
"I think it will contribute significantly to Turkey's and Germany's historical co-operation for 200 years," Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Colonelak, who held a press conference after the end of the tender, said that the winning of German company Siemens was an important message to the region and the world.
Our goals are high.
Today's conclusion was that the economy and energy market were able to move forward with sound and certain steps.
I was very proud to present with this tender that Turkey is leading the region and the most reliable investment countries in the world, no matter how many regional crises there are in the world.
"In this picture, which we will be proud of at 80 million, the biggest contribution is our President's, with 15 years of power and leadership, to bring Turkey to this point," he said.
"One of the most important steps was that up until yesterday, with domestic contribution to the wind, the cost of $10.3/cent purchase cost of $10.48/cent per kilowatt, down to an historic record, and a world record was set at $3.48/cent."
I'm proud of this, for my people, for my country.
"We will include our domestic production wind turbines in the system by the beginning of 2019," he said, adding that they aim to activate the first domestic production panels in solar energy before the end of 2018.
The turbines will be established in five designated areas.
The winner of the competition will take on a total of 1,000 megawatts of established power, with the condition that each of these five regions establish at least 50 megawatt wind forces.
The total investment of the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon group will be over $1 billion.
With domestic wind plants entering the business, the minimum of 3 billion kilowatts of electricity will be produced annually and about 1.1 million households will be provided by the wind.
With wind facilities to be established, the average yield of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2/year emissions will be provided.
The company that won the competition will set up a factory with over $100m in investments.
The factory will produce between 300 and 450 domestic wind turbines, with at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will work for at least 10 years in five areas in at least three of the areas of wing, generator design, material technologies and production techniques, software and innovative gearboxes.
Each year, the budget for RD will be $5m, while 50 technical staff -- 80 per cent domestic engineers -- will be employed.
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project's licensing period is 30 years.
"We plan to finance the equipment from foreign sources and the remaining part from domestic banks," said Kazim Türker, chairman of the board of Türkers Construction, who won the tender consortium, saying that domestic production would be around 64 per cent in the project, and that 35 per cent of equipment would come from abroad.
The tender reflects confidence in the Turkish economy, Turker said.
"It was a tender that would reduce Turkey's external dependency by a thousand megawatts."
He said, "We're happy with the outcome."
"We will do everything we can to reduce the cost of the electric unit," said SIemens Gamesa Turkey Supreme Manager Hakan Yıldırım, who has been operating in Turkey for 160 years.
The locality rate of wind turbines that will be produced at the factory will be 65 per cent minimum.
65% of the 8,000 industrial parts found in the wind turbine will be local (at least 5,200 pieces).
Each of the five districts will have at least 50 MWs, totaling 1,000 MW facilities.
3.750 employment opportunities, 10 years RD requirements, $5 million each year for RD activities.
The 1,000MW Wind Plant is 65% Indian, 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines, at least 2.3 MWe power.
Over $1 billion in investment, 400 MW/year wind turbine production capacity is over $100m a year.
Electricity production to meet the needs of about 1.1 million homes is a minimum of 3 billion kWh electricity production per year, average of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2/year emissions reduction.
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists Re-enact Racist Lynch to Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury was passed through a group of viewers in rural Monroe Georgia, and it went to the little Ford Bridge on Moore.
The car with four black passengers and a white driver stepped forward before reaching the bridge to block the way of an armed group of white men.
The leader of the gang, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, took a long breath from his cigar and looked inside through the windshield.
Inside, the residents were startled by fear.
"We want that bitch, Roger!" he barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
When a young black man was dragged out of the front passenger seat, screaming through the darkness.
Fortunately, this horrific scene on June 22nd is just a reenactment.
But when a noose was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the audience breathed very realistically.
Since 2005, human rights defenders have been returning to the Ford Bridge on Moore (Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) to recreate their lynching by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one's been charged with the murders.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the reenactment, said, "It's hard to believe that even though we've seen them in our communities, even though we know who they are, not one person has been arrested during all these years."
"It's a stain on history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks was a 71-year-old former Georgia State congressman and lifelong human rights advocate.
For him, this is a reenactment, a dramatic call to action, and a yearly reminder to Monroe society that justice has never been corrected.
He said, "We want prosecution, we want results, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first."
"We can't have the healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
On July 27, 1946, the M.E. puts a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Ford lll in Moore.
According to the FBI files obtained by NBC News, over 50 males from Monroe and the surrounding areas were suspects in lynching.
But not one of them was ever investigated.
Although the suspects remained fugitives for decades, human rights advocates say that the twin motivations of lynchings are well-known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a supreme court ruling made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote in the pre-election for the first time at the end of that summer.
According to the FBI, around the same time as the election, black partner Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a fight, apparently related to a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in town was that Hester was sleeping with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying wasn't from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a leading white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcolm out of jail.
Dorothy and her cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey, went to jail with her.
But as they drove away from the prison, when they came to the Ford Bridge on Moore, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes that it was Harrison who arranged and ordered the murders.
"And apparently there was a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement, which not only participated in the murder, but destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses."
Brooks told me less and less.
He said, "This was a voting rights massacre."
"They were all killed to send a message to the black people in this community: 'This is what will happen if you register and vote.'"
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene has been leading the reenactment of Ford Bridge lynchings on Moore, which took place every year.
His performance reveals all the details, a remarkable and profound kind of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to look at, but Greene says that's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about the linch because it makes all of us look ugly inside."
"But if you don't listen to me or listen to what happens to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day near 30 actors (one dozen whites and the rest of them black) flocked to a room and listened willingly when Greene entered the well-rehearsed general lines of the game.
Wade Marbaugh is assistant director of Greene.
He has played the role of President Klansman over the years, but he says the role has never been easy.
Marbaugh said, "I feel dirty because it's not me."
"But I think it's important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room were rehearsing their own lines.
The game begins when Malcolm yells at Hester, where he's furious that he's sleeping with his wife Dorothy.
I said, get off my property!
Rascona's reacting.
There's a knock.
And then everyone -- at least black actors -- is laughing.
Greene laughs the most.
Rascona said, "What? !!"
He was agitated, surprised.
Was I too hard?
Greene said no in the giggles.
"I just don't think white people said shit back then."
One of the black players threw a rock with a joke, saying, "Yes."
"You have to suppress 'R."
So the energy in the room changes, and some kind of intimacy replaces unrest.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not just for the sake of the game, but also for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene's starting again.
This time Rascona says the word that begins with N, sharp and accentuous.
Absolutely no one's laughing.
Resuscitation ends violently and rapidly.
There's screaming, gunfire, and then silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black, standing over actors' bodies, reading Billie Holiday's sad eulogy, "The Weird Fruit."
Her voice breaks in one of the two words.
An audience of four dozen on average, a hundred yards back, wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided, black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the performance, a lot of them up the road.
While Brooks took them on a pilgrimage to the Malcoms and Dorseys' graveyards, they all endured Georgia's oppressive moisture for almost eight hours.
To this point, the murders remained an anecdote, but standing in the same place where the heat is now means the air feels cursed.
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to get close and examine the bodies.
Children squat on their hands, grab their fake blood and their lifeless bodies and whisper to each other.
A little boy mumbling, "They didn't really die," as if he reminded himself.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd, and it's over.
Actors throw the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh in the suit who plays President Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his playmates and tears in their arms, and the emotional cost of performance finally comes to him.
One of the women is whispering, "It's okay."
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Then the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At a table, the white couple from Atlanta are having a heated conversation about reenactment with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski is having trouble finding words about how performance makes her feel.
He said, "Listening to these horrible, horrible words and all that behavior comes from people who look like you, and they do it because they look like you."
"What this does to me is it makes me think that the lynchings are still going on," he added. "They're only called police armed attacks now."
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks is the center of attention when he's eating at his table and telling stories of human rights.
She said she's already planning next year's performance.
He said, "Resurrection is kind of inspiring because it describes what we put up with, but it's also instructive."
"It's like if you don't learn from it, it might happen again.
Those who do not look into their past and do not know what is before them, are doomed to repeat it.
Accident in Muğla: 4 dead; 6 wounded
According to the report, the car with 48 YS 411 license plates under the control of Adam Çık was hit by a 9 B 1510 car in the Sinan Koroğlan administration.

In the accident, Duraniye Kökroğlan and Yasemin Çık were found pregnant for eight months, and Mertcan Kırköğlan were killed at the State Hospital where she was removed.
The wounded Sinan, Senem, Furkan Kıroğlan and Adam, Yilmaz and Abdullah Yiğit were taken to Yükseklen Hospital with the Education and Research Hospital at Koçman University.
It has been learned that the lives of the wounded are still at risk.
Due to the accident, the Bothan-Croatter highway was shut down for a while.
Kavalıkdere Mayor Mehmet Demir and Yağan Gendarmerie Commander Captain Engin came to the scene and received information about the accident.
AK Party's congressional website
By the AK Party,
The web site "akongres.com" was established for the usual Congress process.
The website included brochures, materials and visuals that the party would use in the process.
In the "communications strategy" section of the site, the rules that must be followed during the congressional process were listed in 14 titles.
On the website, President and EC Party President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned members to comply with the party’s institutional identity during the congress process.
"We are now starting a new era of breakthrough."
To achieve their target 2023, we must be renewed and renewed.
He used the phrase, "We must continue to work hand in hand and shoulder tomorrow, as we did yesterday."
Pearson did another 3,000 layoffs, cut the profit to revive the business.
British training group Pearson said he would start another reconstruction programme to overcome the pressures the business faces, while he will do another 3,000 layoffs on Friday and reduce the margin of the dividend by 72 per cent.
Chief executive John Fallon said that the layoffs, mostly late 2018 and early 2019, will be added to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous reconstruction.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to save another 300 million pounds (394 million U.S.) by attempting to revive digital learning with a third cost reduction programme.
The company agreed to sell its share to its partner, Bertelsmann, last month, saying this year's perspective has not changed since it reported its basic sales at £2.05 billion, up 1 per cent in the first half.
Metin 2 has taken him to his death again!
According to the preliminary coroner's report, Hakan's preliminary autopsy report found that his death was suicide.
The detailed examination showed no signs of trauma or algebra in the child's body.
The reason for his suicide is that he was gasping for breath as a result of a tightening of the elastic bandage around his neck.
It was also identified as an elastic bandage used in injuries.
According to a report by Müslim Sarıyar of the newspaper Habertürk, the report stating that the incident was suicide will be sent to the capital prosecutor’s office, which is conducting the investigation.
Police are investigating the boy's suicide in full detail, while further examinations of his confiscated computer continue after the incident.
The police will also appeal to Hakan's friends.
It also states that information from the computer of Hakan, whose relatives call "cleaned" can be accessed to third persons or to a gang.
Police are considering that a gang may have dragged Hakan to suicide.
The fact that Hakan committed suicide turned his eyes into violent Metin2.
Metin 2, banned by the Governorship of Antalya last year by the Governorship of Antalya on the grounds that it caused addiction and violence in children, came up in 2009 with the murder of 13-year-old "minic hacker" Metin Kang.
To play "Metin2", designed in Korea in 2005, he has to go to his website and register for members.
The players are trying to bring peace and justice to the world with the dragon god in the game.
In doing so, there are wars, violent doses increasing.
The game includes images of war, such as lines, swords, machetes, axes, cutting, piercing weapons, as well as images of people being torn apart by wild animals and eaten by flesh.
The player buys characters with money to get stronger.
The family who buried their children the next day continued to claim murder following the incident on July 25th at the house on İstiklal district of Esenyurt İstiklal Street.
"It was all about being an imaginary doctor, and we don't think he can hurt himself or anyone else because of the game," Baba Mehmet Ekinci said. "They wrapped the elastic bandage around his neck and tied a knot next to him."
That's how it was found, son.
We certainly don't think our son could hurt himself or anyone else because of a online game.
We knew you were playing a game like this.
It wasn't a game he played.
Well, let's say he gets a little bored, and then he's out of the game.
Anne Gülizar Ekinci said, "No one's going in or out of the building."
It's said that my child entered the house at a certain time.
None of them match.
When his brother came home, there was only one chair.
"But when his body was found, there were two chairs next to the computer."
He may have been involved with the gang.
Parents don't pay attention in general.
They look at it like, "Whatever happens to my kid in the house."
The child communicates with many people through games.
There may have been a borrowing situation, or swearing.
Or he invited someone in the play to the house, so there might have been a problem.
He may have had an impact, not directly from the game, but because of the problems he had with other people he communicated with over the game.
The boy may have thought the visualization of the game, the fiction of the play was real.
The trauma that led to suicide could be about blackmail.
If the child is faced with a family complaint, there is a depression because he cannot solve it.
He couldn't have committed suicide because of the game itself.
There's also a chance the kid might get involved with the gang.
He could be in the gang.
There can't be anything that the child could have done individually.
I.T. systems consultant Fusun NEBIL: Parents need to know how their children interact
We can't say the games are harmful.
Studies say games are good for children's development.
What's important here is that parents pay attention to what their children play and how they talk to actors online.
Parents need to know what ingredients they're affected by and take precautions.
In Turkey, there are only two children who were said to have died from the play in five years.
It shows that it's not just the games that have an end to a child's life.
I wonder what drove this boy to do it.
We need to find out first.
You need to look at the sociology and psychology around the kid.
Stock market yields 8 months in Istanbul to 50 per cent
The BIST 100 index continued its rise trend in July 2016 and moved its rise to the eighth month above.
Thus, for the first time since July 2007, the index rose 8 months in a row, gaining 45.3 per cent during this period.
With its performance since the beginning of the year, the BIST 100 index left behind the world's main stock markets, including Germany, the United States, Britain, Japan, and left the lead in June, as well as in July.
The Dow Jones index in the United States followed the BIST 100 index in the United States, 0.81 per cent in England, with an increase of 2.54 per cent, completing a 7.06 per cent rise in July.
In Almaya, the DAX index and the Nikkei index in Japan ended July with a loss of value.
As of January-temporary period, the BIST 100 index appears to have performed high on both the major world markets and the developing country stock market indexes.
The BIST 100 index, which won 37.6 per cent compared to the 2016 closure this year, followed by the Dow Jones index, the Dow Jones index with a 5.55 per cent profit, the DAX index with a 4.55 per cent rise, the Nikkei index, and the FTSE 100 index with a 3.21 per cent increase.
The CSCI EM index, which is an indicator of the developing country's stock market, has yielded 23 per cent.
The historical process of the BIST 100 index has shown similar performances in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which recently completed 8 months in a row between December 2006 and July 2007, had increased by 38.3 per cent.
BIST also completed the 100 index from August 1996 to March 1997, gaining an additional value from May 1997 to January 1998.
Meksa Investment Research Director Eren Can Umut told AA correspondent that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for eight months, adding that it has exceeded 37 per cent since the beginning of the year.
Hope, MSCI noted that the developing markets (EM) index has risen 23%, saying that even when we look at these rates, there is positive disparity:
Fund flow to developing countries has been going on since the beginning of the year.
In particular, the funds in the search for higher income prefer the countries that pay higher interest.
In this case, domestic markets are affected in a positive way.
Of course, the appetite for taking risks on a global scale is quite high.
That's how the stock index, which has a risky asset status, is popular.
In the United States, the S&P 500 index has been testing new record levels almost every week, in parallel to its rise of nearly 11 per cent since Christmas.
At the beginning of the year, U.S. Central Minister (Fed) stressed that the estimated 3 interest increase market was stressing, but that Fed was using oral guidance policy to eliminate uncertainty quite well, he said, adding that there was an insensitive market for Fed's interest increase.
In the United States, inflation is not yet at the desired level, and its expectations that Fed will not be quick to increase interest and avoid radical moves are quite effective in existing pricing, the Hope said.
US President Donald Trump's failure to cancel the "Obamacare" health reform strengthens his perception that he cannot meet his commitments to expanding fiscal policies," Hope said. "Although the US economy's expectations, which grow faster thanks to Trump, have a positive effect on stock markets for a period of time, the failure of promises to grow faster growth and faster inflation, strengthens Fed's and the market's hand in this context."
In terms of Turkey's markets, 2016 is a year of many negatives, the Hope noted, and has been trying to close the gap according to similar BIST 100 indexes, which are negatively separated and oversold.
Reporting that they did not see a strong recovery with domestic news stream, the current view could be interpreted more as an increase in risk-taking appetite abroad and as triggering the urge to close the gap, according to similar domestic markets, he said.
The Hope said it was following a number of profits sales in the BIST 100 index, which technically tested new records at 108,600 levels:
In particular, the 109,500-110.000 area is a critical threshold in the short run.
After approaching these levels, it's normal for snow sales to happen.
In the short term, we think that for prices over 110,000, there should be a new story, local or global.
For now, a low 107,500 support could trigger profit sales.
So even if we follow 107,000 intermediate support, I think you can see a release of 106,000 to 106,000 to 105,500.
In particular, breaking 105,500 support could lead to a retreat to 104,300, which is 50 percent of the rise from 100,000 to 108,600.
Both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) decisions will be at the focal point of the global market, Hope said expectations for Fed are already clear, but the possibility of increasing interest in September FOMC could trigger strengthening US dollar.
"The main thing is what the ECB will say," the Hope said, saying, saying that this could trigger profit sales in the developing country (GOU) stock index, which is in the short-term overreach shadow.
Following a meeting of the July monetary policy board, ECB President Mario Draghi voiced that they would discuss the course of monetary policy in the fall, which allowed the euro/dollar party to rise above 1,1700 levels.
Thus, statements that the 60 billion-euro-a-month acquisition programme will be reduced or may end on a global scale would mean that the post-Fed liquidity will also be reduced by the ECB.
"There may be negative pricing on behalf of the country's markets, which are high current deficits such as Turkey and which are required to access foreign funds," he said.
Erol Gürcan, director of Gedik Investment Advisory, said there was a serious rally for global stock markets following Trump's election as president in the United States in November 2016.
Gürcan said it is possible to say that the main element triggering this rally movement is a growing development of global growth expectations, especially with Trump's promises for tax reduction:
The stock market was at the top of the global rally in Istanbul.
One of the main reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has been heavily discounted in recent years compared to similar emerging country markets, but it is good to say that the steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and the financial markets have played a serious role.
In particular, the Loan Guarantee Fund (KGF), which has been activated as of March, has had a serious impact on the emerging index so far.
In the rest of the year, Gürcan said that positive developments have been reflected in significant pricing and that KGF, which has a significant role in this rise, has gradually achieved satisfaction, while the BIST 100 index remains accommodated compared to similar national markets, the search for a new story could gradually come to the for the rest of the year.
The 180-day action plan, which has been eagerly expected to share details for some time, said arrangements to support company profits, such as raising the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, could be a positive contribution in this sense, such as the possible tax reduction recently on the agenda.
"The fact that Fed, Fed, the Central Bank of England, and the key developed country, such as the National Bank of England, will gradually tighten the current expanding monetary policy stances is also among critical risk factors for developing countries," he stressed, stressing that "the fact that Fed, which has been continuing to moderate interest increases for some time, is likely to initiate the reduction of the balance after September, will likely be the end of the ECB's acquisition programme of assets, and that BO will be following the development of the country's developmental interest."
In the upswing trend in the index, which has been seen since the beginning of the year, said the 104,150,-104,600 support zone, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average, is very critical in the coming period, Gürcan said that if this support zone is broken, the correction could proceed to 101,700, 100,000, 99.200, respectively.
In the event of maintaining the current trend for rise and breaking the current historic peak of 108,605 resistance, the index could rise to 110,12,000, he said.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
According to authorities, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several.
In NATO's statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
Local sources that have not been confirmed say three civilians were killed in the incident in the city's Karabab region.
The bombing was the last act of violence in Afghanistan this month; more than 30 people died in a mosque explosion in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said Thursday night's explosion launched an attack on a joint patrol mission with the Afghan army with 'personnel-directed improvised explosive'.
All wounded are in good condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram air base, the statement said.
Reporters say the Taliban's growing power and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabağ are a key concern for NATO forces, located near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan witnessed the deaths of at least 1662 civilians in the first half of 2017, with an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb in Kabul, mostly Shia, killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On 31 May, after U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001, the biggest militant attack in the country killed more than 150 people in the centre of the city.
The act of violence highlights US President Donald Trump's unstable security situation in Afghanistan as he puts his weight on whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's military and police.
Reporters say recent suicide bombings in Kabul have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, especially President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
The EPA has stopped delaying the dirty air rule after trials
The United States EPA returned a day later after a resolution on delaying the law, which demanded that the states block emissions that caused the smoke, a law on Obama's transfer law, 15 states filed a lawsuit on this initiative.
The EPA announced late Wednesday its decision to continue with the "2015 Ozon Decisions", saying it demonstrates its commitment to working with the provinces.
"We believe in dialogue and sensitivity with our state partners," EPA President Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone decisions by one year until October 2018, with these decisions measuring the current pollution of smoke in various parts of the country, and deciding where to cut the more difficult air quality standards.
On Tuesday, 15 states, mostly Democrats, and the Columbia District, filed a lawsuit that said this effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration continues its quest to restore wide range of environmental regulations, implemented by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda that Trump called revitalising economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked the reaction of the Democrats and protective groups who are concerned about the impact of more emissions on public health.
EPA's website says ozone-related air breathing "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma".
The forest has given us the good news...
It's time for the sterner and wing transfer!
Beşiktas President Fikret explained to Bein Sports about the transfer of Dutch football player Jeremain Lens and stoper.
Fikret Forest said...
There's no surprise in the transfer.
We're not looking for a lot of transfers, we're looking for a dot shot.
Now we're going to do a sterner and a wing transfer.
We've got Champions League games, so I hope we get a good draw.
We have to do a wing transfer.
10 million euros is easy, but we don't have that kind of budget.
If it comes to the budgets we call it, we'll transfer it, and if we don't, we won't die.
I can't give you any information until I'm clear about the lens.
We're a public company.
The end of patience is peace.
The ISIS threat only exists for August 30th, not for the festival?
The Ankara Governorship continues to respond to its ban on sit-ins, memorial meetings and other mass activities, including concerts during August, on the grounds of "ISIS threat".
The governorate’s ban has the expression “all mass activities” in Ankara, while 7 in Ankara.
The International Grand Ankara Festival continues.
CHP Group Deputy Chair and Ankara MP Levent Gök told SÖZCÜ that "August 30th cannot be affected by curfews" and said:
There's some serious confusion.
Even the governor's office is hesitant as to what decision to execute...
The government's job is to create areas where the holidays will be celebrated.
CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir said "All Ankara has a security problem, only Gökçek's organizations have no security problems".
Ankara Independent MP Aylin Nazlıaka carried the ban to parliament.
"Doesn't this ban make clear the AKP's hostility to the republic and Ataturk clear? How do you intend to prevent millions from celebrating August 30th in the areas?" Nazlıaka said, making a motion for the Prime Minister's reply.
"I learned from Edwina myself that I was deceived."
Demet Sener, who continued the divorce case with Ibrahim Kutluay, was in Asli Hatemi with his attorney, Nisanstone the other day.
Şener, who sued Edwina Sponza, who claimed to have destroyed her home, presented photos of Sponza and Kutluay together as evidence to the court.
The society's beautiful Sponza also filed charges against Sener, saying, "Dett has taken my private photos illegally."
'I DIDN'T KNOW.'
After this recent development, Sener met with his lawyer at Nisantaş Delicatessen and saw the journalists and left the premises.
Sener, the cheerful one, laughed when Edwina Sponza's claim about the photos was reminded, "God, I must have broken into her house and taken it."
Aslı Hatemi also complained about Sponza's complaint, "There's a complaint like that, but the content isn't right."
He said, "We've got it all; we've submitted it to the court."
"Everyone knew about your wife's relationship with Sponza during the last period."
"How did you not know?"
What?
How?
"I swear I didn't know," said Sener, "would I believe my husband who looked me in the eye or the rumor of the people?"
"Didn't you hear?" said Sener first, after reporters insisted on saying, "No," he said. "I didn't hear it, of course I heard it the first time."
But in no way did I believe that.
Everything was normal, it was there; there was nothing to suspect.
Ma'am, once I put everything in my hand, I've learned it all, so...
"Was it Sponza who sent the evidence?" She answered, "Yes"; confused them, claiming that Sponza himself sent the photographs and correspondence to the court.
Sponza once claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay had been edited.
Beşiktaş will sign with Negredo tomorrow
The Beşiktaş Club will officially recruit Spanish football player Alvaro Negredo tomorrow.
The signing ceremony will be held at Vodafone Park for Negredo, where Besiktas has agreed on the principle of Spain's transfer to the Valencia Club.
The signing ceremony, which will be attended by club president Fikret Orman, will be held at 12:00.
By the way, the Spanish football player will also have a health check tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar Economy and Trade Minister Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani said they wanted to express their gratitude to Turkey's people.
Al Thani: "Thank you so much for your generous attitude and your support."
My brother, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, sends greetings from the Qatar Emir.
The Qataran economy has proven its resistance.
In many countries, economies are negatively affected, while our economy remains stable.
We must work hard to ensure Qatar's independence and strength.
Within hours, we have largely broken the embargo against us, thanks to Turkey.
We're not short on anything right now.
Our natural resources, gas exports, are a huge support for Qatar's economy.
We weren't affected by Turkey's brutal blockade against the law.
Today, Qatar continues its production worldwide in gas and LNG.
"We have experienced a 30 per cent increase in our gas exports, not a drop after what has happened," he said.
"There has been a volume of $554m in the first quarter of trade between us," Al Thani said, adding that the sisterhood relations between Qatar and Turkey continue to work in all areas.
Recent decisions have played an important role.
As a result of its self-proportionation in the Qatar market, it is very important for us to accelerate the entrance of goods from Turkey in all sectors, making investments in many areas.
"I thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us," he said.
The cost of recent disasters is $300 million.
TSB President Can Akın Çağlar said that after the flood on July 18th, the insurance companies received 70,000 euro damage reports, that 800 reported damage damages in the Gökova earthquake on July 21st, and that on July 27th there were reports of floods and floods in Istanbul, which cost over 168 million liras of damages, saying the last three incidents found 300m euros in insurance.
"The damage caused by the loss of the cap insurance in terms of the body damage per vehicle is around $3,500, and the glass damage is around $1,000."
"In the depression, the average housing damage is 6,000 liras," he said.
Stressing that they are working hard as a sector to compensate for economic losses, Can Akın Çağlar said that 3 out of 4 people do not have housing insurance, one in 2 businesses do not have fire insurance, and 2 in 3 do not have insurance insurance, adding: "The risk of natural disaster is increasing due to climate change."
Due to the low-insurance rate in our country, the risk of facing serious damage costs to our citizens and institutions is growing every day.
All these costs shouldn't be left on top of the government.
Insurance policies aren't as expensive as they seem, insurance isn't just a sector that pays for damages, but it's also a risk management consultant.
It's very important for our people and our country to increase the level of insurance awareness and insurance.
"Casco insurance says in general conditions that insurance should report damage within five working days, and that time ended yesterday."
"Is he going to be a victim of insurance?" he answered. "Although that's usually the case, the statute of limitations is two years in the Trade Law."
He also said, "This is a natural disaster, so the insurance people don't have to panic, no company says they're not paying."
That's how the German media saw the huge bid!
During a time of growing difficulties between Turkey and Germany, the German company Siemens won Turkey's first Wind Energy Renewable Energy Resources (YEA) tender.
"German Siemens won the huge tender in Turkey," the German media announced.
"The consortium will invest over $1 billion in wind facilities," DWelle said in a report that the Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon consortium won the YAKA tender.
"The tender for the creation of a thousand megawatt wind energy capacity is the first tender in Turkey to be the YEA tender," the report said, adding that the number of companies competing in the tender today fell from 8 to 2, facing Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortiums, and the Chinese Mingyang consortium withdrew from the tender at the beginning of the 30th round.
After the tender, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak made a dramatic statement on Turkey-German relations.
The tender was concluded by the German company Siemens, and we can say that this picture is an important message to the region and to the world.
In terms of Turkey and Germany's 200-year historical co-operation, I think it will contribute substantially to Turkey-German relations.
I'm very proud to announce that the region of Turkey is leading the most reliable investment countries in the world, no matter how regional crises there are in the world.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible competition.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, whose paths will cross for 147 pounds six in the near future to demonstrate the most satisfying boxing match, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
Garcia, champion of the Undefeated World Boxing Council, was in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until he walked down the aisle and greeted World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
On Saturday at Showtime, unanimously, after Garcia's defeat of former world champion Adrien Broner on the four-cycles, both fighters are among the top five members of the unsavory list.
Garcia reached out her right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck with that."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN at 7:00 a.m. Saturday night.
While the two posed for photographs, Lomochenko's manager, Egis Klimar, recorded that a potential match between fighters would be "excellent size".
Garcia gave me the "I'm an old feather dick" reminder.
"I've gone up to the top of the stairs for Broker, but I'm not that big.
I'm little for 140.
I'd like to get down to light.
He'll have to pass the lightweight, so we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this."
Lomachenko has joined.
"Shit needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be in 'pay and watch'; setting a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) for the next summer and making Lomachenko fight in an opening match of £135 this year is part of his strategy; Garcia is interested in fighting the winner of the lightweight title at the Forum on September 23rd.
"The fight could be in 'pay and watch' because all the fans want it," Garcia said, and then he said that he was open to whichever channel offered the best financial package.
We're the real names.
No other name would create such an interest.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said she appreciated Lomachenko as a "great fighter" and that she could attend her Saturday match.
But Lomachenko hesitated to give Garcia a lot of credit, and said he thought the three heavyweight champions from Riverside looked "too slow," "sorry, Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was first to show the power of the fist, then boxing.
Both said they felt that momentum was created for their own encounter.
"This is a fight that needs to be fought.
Another fight doesn't create that much attention and gossip.
Garcia said, "I'm happy to deal with this."
Lomachenko said, "I waited for the best fighters, and he's Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight."
From Russia to America Turkish reservist
The White House does not intend to impose sanctions that will affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of those lines.
That's because the debt cost is increasing.
Concerned that Western investment partners would consider withdrawing from the projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin in response stepped up construction of pipelines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which built the Turkish Stream line, which was scheduled to reach Turkey under the Black Sea, has stepped up construction at Gazprom's request.
Reuters also wrote that Gazprom began construction of a second pipeline parallel to Turkish Stream "in a hurry" to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment test have been announced
The latest results of the evaluation tests of refugees who are subject to a new medical age assessment in Sweden have ruled that more than 80 per cent of those who have been tested are over 18 years old, but not all are confident of the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden's National Bureau of Forensic Medicine and Medicine (Rättsmedicinalvertet) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to improve the age assessment of the Swedish Immigration Agency (Migrationsvertet) during the asylum process after the assessment of the failures of some refugees who claim to be minors to evaluate their right age.
So far, Migrationsvertet has sent 6880 cases to the test, and the Forensics and Medicine Agency has announced the results of 2481 of the period from mid-March 31, 2017.
80 per cent (2002 per cent) was ruled to be 18 or over, and 25 cases, the Forensics and Medicine Agency ruled that the subject was "perhaps 18 and over".
In 432 cases, the person was probably under 18.
The tests were conducted only in cases where one's age was suspicious.
According to Johan Goransson of Forensics and Medicine, the results are consistent with past months.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics according to the past months, the numbers are very consistent," The Local told SETimes.
The proportion of cases ruled to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees lie about their age.
In May, the agency announced the result of the 581 test and said there were 442 cases "which show that the people who were tested were 18 or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 cases, he found that 243 cases clearly declared that they had turned 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which includes X-raying 20 - year - old teeth and doing an MRI scan of knee joints, and then being analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, who assesses the biological maturity of people who have studied the age of puberty sooner or later.
"I have reason to think about it, and I don't think this is the kind of measurement that's used.
It's very suspicious to decide on a biological age this way.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend," the Metro newspaper said.
However, Göransson of Forensics and Medicine argued that the tests were correct: "In general, the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is small.
The biggest risk is that the person is just under 18 years old, in which case the risk is around 10 per cent."
The Star Mosque opens for worship today
In 1885 by Abdulhamit, architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, the mosque of the Star Hamidiye, which was built by architect Nikolaidis, will now be inaugurated by Friday prayer after the restoration work.
Regional Manager Mürsel Sarı said the restoration work, which began in June 2013, was completed and the mosque was ready for the opening.
Yellow said, "Restration work was conducted on 2."
The first part was repairing the mosque, the main building.
The second part was the environmental arrangement.
In the first part, about $16 million was spent on the environment arrangement and around $11 million.
First, the bullets of the wooden dome were opened, and after they were renewed, the outer walls, the dirt of external factors, were cleared of rust.
There's been a drain on the resuscitation.
When we get inside the mosque, there are very rich decorations.
It's a work of stars, and it's very rich in pencils.
There's a mixed style here.
"There are also traces of snails in the architecture of baroque style, if you think it was made in the Ottomans and 1885s."
U.S.I.H.A.'S WORK
"The chandelier in the middle of the glass is the German Emperor 2."
He had partial malfunctions, he was refurbished and hung.
It's a really valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages on both sides of the mosque that are symmetrical, called salutations.
We know this was done by our great Khan Abdulhamit Khan, who built the mosque himself.
So we have information that he built them himself and was installed here.
They're still standing here in their original form.
Sarı said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to attend the mosque's opening ceremony.
Pantic claim in Göztepe
The Ukrainian press said that a 25-year-old Serbian footballer who could not qualify in Dinoma Kiev could be hired to a yellow red club.
Pantic began football on Serbia's Red Star team, and played for Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed Dinamo Kiev during last season's halftime.
The governor of West Virginia has announced that he will change his party.
Jim Justice, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia, announced Thursday night that he would change his party at a rally with President Trump.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have abandoned me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I'll tell you with many prayers and thoughts... "I'll tell you today as West Virginians, "I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor."
The rally was flooded with cheering.
"So I can change my registration as a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
"If I were a technical director, it would be time to set up a different game for you."
Mr. Trump promised to make an important announcement at the West Virginia rally earlier.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points and didn't support Democratic candidate Justice, Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he owns coal mines in five states with the coal business he inherited from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Congress issued a statement saying that "the change of parties by Governor Justice was another blow to the Democratic Party, which prefers to work to prevent our country from making it bigger than to make it bigger".
"With the control of only 15 governors and at least 15 state legislators in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is the latest rejection of a party that is headless from head to toe and cannot find a positive, unifying message," RNC female spokesman Ronna McDBS told SETimes.
I'll do what's best for Turkey
Olympic third, Turkey's record holder.
He was born in Cuba, but the country he came to for F.Bahce gave him his own country...
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and became a national...
First he became European champion, then the third Olympic champion...
Now it's one of Turkey's most important medals at the World Athletics Championship.
Yasmani Capello, who competes in the 400m hurdles, spoke to SABAH before the championship starts today.
When they were young, they didn't want you because they didn't like your grades in Cuba.
You hired a coach and improved yourself.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
Some people think you chose Turkey for money.
What are you talking about?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was leaving the national team.
From that moment on, I've drawn a line to what I've been through, what I've been through.
Then I came to Turkey with an invitation from the Fenerbahçe club.
And my attempt to join the national team was thanks to Fenerbahçe.
They've made me an offer for reinforcements.
I've turned over a new leaf with Turkey.
I've had many injuries in my youth, but I've achieved significant success in Rio and Amsterdam after the opportunities offered to me in Turkey.
I can't wait to do my best at the World Championships of Athletics and win a different title.
You cried at a press conference the other day.
Can you tell us why?
Every time I get asked a question about Turkey taking care of me, I think of my childhood, being kicked out of the Cuban national team at 23.
And, of course, in Turkey, people are coming at me.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt the same way when I was playing the national anthem.
I couldn't stop crying.
And thanks to Turkey for giving me the opportunity to make my dreams come true.
I'm so glad I belong to the Turkish national team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said you might have a Turkish girlfriend before.
You're with a Turk, you went to Cuba together.
Would you like to share what you've been through?
The biggest plus of being with a Turk is calm...
Compared to Cuban women, peace...
Turkish girls are taking care of their relationship.
Your girlfriend is also your assistant coach.
You've been together all day, like, in your diet?
He eats more sweets than I do.
(Both laugh) I don't actually have a very strict diet, but sometimes it interferes with what I eat.
My trainer, Massimo Matrone, often gives me strict warnings on my diet, but I know it's for my own good.
How are you with Turkish food, does your boyfriend cook for you?
Turkish women cook so well, but my boyfriend makes it better.
(laughs) Dry beans are my first choice.
I just laughed at him.
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He replaced me with other young people.
We met in Cuba after winning medals for Turkey.
He looked at me and showed me to the young athletes next to him and said, "Well, look, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.
MY SEARCH MY HORRIBLE
The thing about the glasses you wear at the races is...
I'm just using it for concentration.
The moment I put on my glasses, I cut off my relationship with the world and put up a wall on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
What's the first thing that comes to your mind when we say Tokyo 2020?
Felix Sanchez...
He won the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics at the age of 35 in the 400m disabled.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at 33.
TURKCELL EXPECTS
"We sincerely believe that Yassani Capello will represent our flag best in this championship," Turkcell Deputy General Administrator Ismail All said, saying they believe that Yasmani Capello will succeed in London.
We wish all our athletes good luck in London.
"We will continue to support the development of Turkish athleticism and greater achievements for our country," he said.
Coe praises Russia's 'samimi' apology for the doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the boss of global athleticism, praised Russia's sincere apology for the doping scandal, but stressed that the time was not right for the country to be accepted back into sports.
Russia's athletic boss, Dmitry Shylakhtin, told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship that its country should be banned from sports and that it is determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized to "all athletes who were forced to receive gold and silver medals in the competition".
Despite his assessments, the IAAF Congress voted for the ban to continue after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia in November 2015.
"I think today is a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation," IAAF chief Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation had accepted him, that he had survived very turbulent days, and that he would do everything possible to restore the Federation."
Coe said Russia was also "happy" when it accepted its re-approved criteria.
"I think it is a very constructive day, and I think it has been moved, but Congress supports the task force's proposal that it is not the right time for Russia's rights to be restored," Coe said.
"In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been to ask to separate clean athletes from the imperfect system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the solid IAAF criteria, will be competing objectively at the World Championship of Athletics, which will begin in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met many criteria for the extradition of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that the drug test is still insufficient and that banned trainers are still free to work.
Do not deny the U.S.'s 'YPG to Tank' news
The US Embassy in Ankara has announced that no tank has been given to anyone fighting in Syria.
Hundreds of trucks loaded with tanks and guns have been denied to the YPG.
"An explanation of the wrong news about trucks going to Syria", the Embassy said in a statement:
In a series of untrue news reports in the last few days, the United States has allegedly sent hundreds of trucks loaded with tanks and weapons to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some fundamental facts about the current situation in Syria.
The United States did not give tanks to any group in Syria who fought against Deasha.
Most of the US's military assistance, primarily with light arms and ammunition, supports the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) elements within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
Syrian Arabs, including SAK, are fighting to clear the region and get their homes back.
TYDTA President Ermut: Direct foreign investment over last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said that 55 per cent of all investments from last year came after July.
"Maybe there was going to be more increase," Ermut said, adding that there was no decline in investments due to the July 15th FETÖ coup attempt.
Maybe if these conditions didn't happen, if there weren't some regional improvements, we'd see an increase in impact.
That's why we have more hope for next year.
I hope it'll be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
As of the first five months, we're already going up 11 percent from last year's first five months.
But we don't think that's enough.
"We hope there's more."
"It is necessary that global, regional developments, not that we are concerned," Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut reminded SETimes that 75 per cent of direct investments normally come from Europe by 2010.
That number is down to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share rose from 2 per cent to 7-8 per cent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do that, the Gulf countries had some problems among themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them; especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar are two important actors.
But the problem between these two countries upsets us and, of course, allows investors to delay their decision a little longer.
Not only in terms of investments in Turkey, but we may have some delays.
Arda Ermut reminded me that there were some incidents in Germany last week, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had a clear and precise reaction to the situation.
"Look, problems are between governments, certainly not among the public."
Second, these people came and invested in my country.
They're no different to us than Turkish companies.
On the contrary, if they have any problems, they'll come to us, and we'll figure it out.
"We will certainly not allow them to be victims," Ermut said, adding that they continue to support all investors with comfort.
"We can guarantee that in the future," Ermut said.
You'll see, no German companies, no investors from some of the countries where we're having political problems in any way will have any trouble.
On the contrary, I hope we will do our best to increase investment from these countries.
We think the investments from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions of the investment environment.
"But we will do our part at this point, and we will do our best with the goal of not affecting our investors' perception of the investment environment."
TYDTA President Ermut said Turkey began to take great interest from China after a single generation of one-way strategies, but that if problems in the Gulf are resolved, they expect the largest investment from the Gulf.
"In relations with Germany, 'We had trouble with these relations, we had investments because of this incident, we were running away'," Ermut said. Using his statements, there are companies coming, coming and following.
"Almost 10 per cent of the projects in our portfolio are for German companies."
So almost 10% of the companies we've been seeing from all over the world are German companies.
Some of them are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
The guy's gonna expand his investment, or he's got a subject, and he's open as a project, and we're open as a project.
"In fact, German companies are still an important part of our daily business flow," he said.
Emphasising that all state institutions should be careful during the time of perception operations to Turkey, Ermut said the issue is sensitive and could be affected by the slightest bad communication.
Ermut explained that what has happened in the past two or three weeks has been a good lesson:
Investors and politicians always have different agendas.
We've always seen that economic relations always sort of put political developments on the road.
Germany will remain an important business partner and an important investor.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
The election agenda in Germany, unfortunately, increases such rhetoric.
I think it'll all work out a little bit more once they're through.
In Saudi Arabia, the two countries are also careful not to make negative statements.
After all, an investor who invests in Turkey is investing in the entire environmental country's markets.
So, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region, there have been processes that have slowed down a little.
But we're still interviewing these investors.
In my opinion, investors are holding off on a decision they may be able to make faster.
We don't have a Saudi investor who says, 'I'm getting out of here because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia in a negative sense.'
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who are still living in Turkey, who are here on vacation, who are meeting with us on the other hand, who are pursuing all of their processes.
"I think we will definitely beat him this year.
"But how long we will pass, these regional developments will affect global uncertainties," he said.
While hoping that the impact would be greater, Ermut said, perhaps a little bit more limited, pointing out that by the first five months there was an 11 per cent increase, that it could be protected, and said, "If, hopefully, there is no bad news, I believe we will definitely close the end of the year better than last year."
Citing that a significant part of the withdrawal would continue to be real estate, Ermut said new investments could be seen in logistics, health, fintech, IT, petro-chemicals, food, energy and manufacturing.
Emphasizing that there will be new investments to be announced in the coming months, Ermut said, "We may soon have an investment announcement in terms of manufacturing."
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a big investment.
"There may also be investments from interesting countries," he evaluated.
Operation in 9 provinces to 4 wine companies: 55 detentions
İstanbul Anti-Smuggling Crime Branch teams have determined that the foil coating on the four wine companies that have sold them has been long and loose and the bandrolls have not been glued to the bottle, and TAPDK bands attached to the coating have been collected after the products have been sold, and have been marketed by the new wines.
According to the olis teams, the government lost $20,400,000 in taxes due to the repeated use of bandrolls of suspects.
Police teams carried out co-op operations today on 55 addresses including four wine companies in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdağ, Bursa, Balıkesir, Manisa, Aydın, Denizli and Nevşehir.
A total of 55 people were taken into custody in the operation, while the calls contained 15,000 available wines, 52,480 used wine bottles, 12,890 TAPDK bands, 3 pistols and bullets, 100 boxes of sexual drugs, 992 stolen cigars, 698 bottles of fake alcohol, and 100 litres of Anason essences.
55 people detained were brought to the Department of Trafficking Crimes on Vatan Street.
The suspects are still being processed at the police station.
Their operation with the factories, warehouses and businesses was reflected in police cameras.
Police teams made calls to a warehouse that showed him taking off the hoods that were found on the wine bottles that were ready for sale.
Police teams have been recorded investigating bags of TAPDK band-rolled hoods collected from used bottles.
How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar's departure to Paris?
Rules aimed at preventing the unlimited spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring world records from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
From UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain, the European governing unit that has the power to block teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
The Financial Fair Game rules, issued by UEFA in 2011, mean that the PSG will eventually have to finance Neymar's transfer without experiencing massive losses.
Barcelona has been paid 222m euros (262m) to buy the Brazilian out of the contract, and Neymar will manage a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some of the financial aspects of Neymar's trip to France are:
Given the team's energy-rich Qatari family money, the PSG can pay Neymar to sign and add it to the galaxy of other stars, of course.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to get players, but they have to balance it with legitimate income resources, provided they're in charge of their football-related business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that had gone into huge debts for success had been active fraud, and that if banks or owners pulled their support, he was at risk of bankruptcy.
In 2011, the FFP began monitoring the losses of clubs rather than focusing on their debts.
The change meant that the model Roman Abramovic first used in Chelsea in 2003 (take a club with potential, spend a lot of money to improve the team and create a global brand) would be a more difficult attempt.
During the three-year FFP evaluation period, which lasted until 2018, clubs could suffer 30m euros in damage.
Although Platini was dishonorably removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Cefer, is still determined to be given up on excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso, who manages the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "FFP is definitely not dead, and we will surely strengthen it by moving the rules forward," Andrea Traverso told the Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG will pay for Neymar's purchase in bulk, it may be able to extend the amount to the contract period for accounting reasons.
Neymar signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee could be listed as a 44.4m-euro cost in the next five years' annual accounts.
The first wave in 2014 saw the implementation of the most heavy sanctions in Manchester City, owned by the FFP and the PSG and Abu Dhabi.
The PSG was later sentenced to 60m euros, which was later reduced to 20m euros (at the time $882m) and was ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of 25 for the 2014-2015 season.
The UEFA is alert to clubs that can try to deceive financial regulators by inflated its income through companies linked to the owners of the club.
Although a Qatarian company can sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsorship is thought to exceed the standard market value, UEFA will not allow it to be counted as a legitimate income.
This happened in 2014 when the Qatar Tourism Authority ruled that the PSG sponsorship was inflated.
Some of Neymar's winnings from the PSG are reportedly due to payments from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organisation committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar would become the World Cup ambassador, and such action could easily be uncovered by UEFA regulators.
The past sanctions applied to the PSG mean that UEFA will be even more careful against attempts to overcome the rules.
According to the experts on Tuesday, the UEFA is not in a preemptive meeting with the PSG regarding Neymar's transfer.
Since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG's situation, they spoke to The Associated Press on condition of secrecy.
Recent accounts show that the PSG made more than 10m euros in 2015-16, with 542.4m euros in circulation.
Last fiscal year's accounts have not yet been published.
The PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship agreements, gift and jersey sales.
The club expects the turnover to increase by at least 30 per cent after signing.
The Spanish league, which was clearly disturbed by the departure of one of the biggest players in football, tried to stop Neymar's departure from claiming that the PSG had violated the FFP.
"This is an open case of 'mali doping' with its club and its state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS, referring to Qatar's absolute ownership of the PSG.
Arsenal director Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports giant, shares his concerns about the financing of La Liga by a state.
"This is the result of having, and in the last 15 years, it has completely changed the entire floor of football," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has a club, anything is possible.
It's hard to respect the Financial Fair Play because for a country that a big player like that represents a country can have different methods or different interests.
The insurance company's 'favorable price' riot
According to TSB data, the insurance sector has been losing money in traffic since 2006.
The sector that lost $2.35 billion in 2015, and only $19m in 2016.
The stock market is being processed in Istanbul -- Aksgorta, Anadolu Insurance and Solar Insurance.
Speaking at a meeting assessing TSB's first six-month results in 2017, the Ages said the 11-year-old damage in traffic insurance has reached $7.3 billion, and that they predicted that with ceiling premiums, the sector's damage would increase to $2.3 billion this year, estimated damage-prim rate to 125 per cent.
"This means that by financing the bad driver, we also increase the price of the citizen's housing policy."
"75 per cent of the operator is foreign, and our partners abroad are, in a sense, financing the bad driver," he said.
The ages continued:
We don't expect any profit from traffic, but looking at the past 11 years, we don't show any profit.
"We also accept that, but we continue to hope that we can carry that damage in a reasonable environment with other policies," he said.
"In 2012, there were about 30 per cent increase in traffic insurance, nearly doubled in 2015, and we wrote the biggest damage in our history," he said.
"Even in an environment where prices have increased so much, at the end of 2016 our profits were only $19m in traffic," he said.
"We will lower the price of the good driver on the free fare and put a high price on the bad driver," he said next year.
"But the Treasury is looking at general progress, and the last word on when will be in the Treasury," he said.
The Treasury Undersecretary said the rise in mandatory traffic insurance premiums since 2015 has affected a large part of society, adding that since April 12th, it has moved to maximum bonus (price).
According to this, maximum premiums on mandatory traffic insurance policies have been set in the province groups, with each car group, step and traffic density and accident statistics considered.
Meanwhile, as of July, the "Risli Insurance Pool" application for high-frequency steps or vehicle groups has been implemented in mandatory traffic insurance.
The premium and damage for the pool-related traffic insurance policies will be shared among insurance companies.
The premium for these insurance people will be identified by the Treasury Undersecretary.
In the first six months of 2017, the growth of premiums in traffic was reduced by 11.5 per cent compared to the same period last year, while the number of policies increased by 4.9 per cent, up to 8.6 million, with inflation, the reduction in traffic policies reached about 30 per cent, he said.
"With these ceiling prices, this damage cannot be sustained.
How much more damage can the industry take?"
"Why are foreigners financing the good driver, why are my thousands of shareholders financing the bad driver in Turkey?" he said.
He said, "At this point, we're trying to tell the Treasury."
"They haven't come to that yet," Çağlar said following these developments, following a question as to whether foreigners have reached the point of weight reduction in the Turkish insurance sector.
They expect to invest more in Turkey because it is 1.3 in Turkey, with an average of 6 policies per person falling in the Netherlands.
"So Turkey is a place to really grow up," he said and continued.
So they haven't given up on this place.
But even though the company earns a reasonable profit every year, it uses it to grow, leaving all the profits in the system.
According to TSB data, the production of bonuses in the sector was $40.5 billion in 2016, while 23.1 billion in the first half of this year increased by 12 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The eras predicted that the sector would not complete its overall bonus production with 15 per cent growth per year, he said.
News of welfare for thousands of chronic patients
The details and implementation of the "New Social Assistance Programme for Families and Social Policies", which began a while ago, under the direction of Family and Social Policies Minister Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, became clear.
The programme, which will be launched for poor citizens and their families, will take advantage of 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients in the first stage.
Patients will receive monthly support over two-thirds of the minimum wage, as well as regular psychosocial support.
The ministry will also pay additional payments to tuberculosis patients, who are unable to provide medical self-care, who are dependent on the bed or who are determined to improve home living conditions.
The payments will be made through PTT through Social Aid Cards.
For reasons such as geographical conditions, illness, disability, those who cannot make a withdrawal will be paid at the door.
In many ways, the programme is also the first in the world.
One of the 10 companies to invest is still German.
Prime Ministership Turkey Investment Support and Promotion Agency President Arda Ermut said German companies in Turkey are seen as Turkish companies, and political tension between the two countries is not reflected in the business world.
"In relations with Germany, there is no investor who says, 'We've had trouble running away because of this situation.'"
"About 10% of the projects in our portfolio are for German companies."
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"The Germans are an important part of our daily business flow," he said.
Ermut said the Abracage Group's partnership with the logistics company Netlog was also a good example.
"We invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey," Abraaj Group partner Omar Syed said, pointing to economic growth in Turkey.
Autonomous is on his way to becoming the Last Ottoman
The seasoned football player, whose management has given two weeks to find a club, has agreed with Ottomanspor, and will sign an official contract in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, he signed a contract with the green-black club four hours before the transfer was completed, while he was in 29 leagues, two trophies, while five goals were a major contribution to the team with four assists.
The government closed its way back to Azer and agreed to replace this player yesterday with Brazilian Sergio Antonio.
The transfer of the century has occurred!
Barcelona said Neymar was transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for 222m euros.
Recent transfer development, followed by the excitement of football public, has been made official.
For the Brazilian player, the PSG added the Catalan team to the star name cast, paying 222m euros for the player's release.
Neymar was the most expensive transfer in football history, with the cost of this bonus.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) of the French 1st Football League (Ligue 1) announced that he signed a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
Neymar, 25, who was given 222m euros for the bonus fee, became the world's most expensive football player, signed a contract to be in the PSG by 30 June 2022, the club's website said.
"Since I started my football life in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most competitive and ambitious teams," Neymar said after the signing ceremony.
The reason I came to this club to join my teammates is to get a lot of trophies, as our fan wishes."
The PSG will pay Neymar 45m euros each season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the representative of France over 400m euros.
Marine workers' strike ended with a raise
The collective agreement between İzmir Metropolitan Municipality's company, IZENİZEN A.Ş. and the Turkish-Istak Marine Union (TDS) was not reached.
After that, the union members of the U.S.A. were on strike on July 12th.
The strike, which lasted almost a month, ended as of 3 p.m. today after a raise for workers.
According to the signed collective contract of employment, the salary of land personnel within the U.S.A. will be increased by 12 per cent.
With an IRS exemption from the IRS, which has renewed its fleet, 5 per cent is accepted for personnel of ship's status, whose salary has increased by 25 per cent.
INSTITUTION General Directorate has announced that flights in the interior Gulf will continue with normal tariffs, while the campaigns in mourning will begin on Tuesday, starting with Foça and Urla from next weekend.
"Izmir people will be relieved," TDS President Hasan Pedemir said, saying they have locked up transportation with 23 days of strikes.
As a result of the strike, improvements were made to our workers working on land and sea.
We're leaving the table happily.
An average share of 28 per cent will go into the sea's working pocket, and 20 per cent on land will go into its pocket.
We had friends who worked at minimum wage.
We've made serious improvements on their salaries, too.
Nostalgia, "Wet American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So, for the glory days of characters in the '80s, for the grunge period (when brains such as David Wain and Michael Showalter did the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for himself, their star Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, before they went on with bigger things, this version of the story was nostalgic for all of them.
As a cultural product, it's both the immaterialization of our ever-rememorial Facebook era.
But as a series, it's like he's out of time.
"The First Day of the Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and it wasn't only because of his absurd humor (there was a story about the origins of a talking box of plants performed by H. Jon Benjamin).
Focusing on the real humor (the middle-aged actors playing horny children of their age) made it impossible to re-catch the part of the joke in the past.
Now, "Ten Years Later", where adults play adults, is less emotional and more random, including a monologue about a perverted follower movie like the '90s Hand Shakes the Cradle.
At one point, the character confuses an Apple Powerbook, some single-line roller skates, and "a lot of other things from 1991".
Most of the original stories are the same.
Mr. Coop (Mr. Showalter) is a writer now, yet he hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And now there's another crazy plan involving Ronald Reagan (mr. Showalter) in which George H. W. Bush is now instigated (a very well-placed imitation by Michael Ian Black).
As usual, the best part of the series is intermediaries.
It's especially nice to see young Mr. Rudd, who always has Matt Dillon's under-lip beard in "The Singles," whose Andy, the most popular kid in the old school, looks like an old man.
There may be random moments of insanity that give power to this series (for example, a repetitive series of "Seven Up!", which is what I think is the logical result of: "Wet American Summer: Twenty Years Later", which, in the last scene, will allow the crew of friends to go to see the premiere of "Wet American Summer."
"Comrade Detective", meanwhile, addresses a different form of nostalgia in the Amazon: "The Americans"' Cold War resurrection, film "The Yellow Bomb" and even his iconography against Western wrestling, "LOW".
A comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, appears to be found TV: a 1980s drama of Romanian police friends in which two Bucharest police officers fought for real, atheism and Marxist-Leninist roads.
The lead roles are played by the wolf Gregor and idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, and are performed by Channing Tatum (also the lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But that's not much of an idea.
There are some nice visual jokes.
Among them is Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Seviny, a well-known cast of voice-to-know.
But "Comrade Detective" is so dedicated to making a clumsy propaganda drama look like the truth that he's often playing just like a murderer wearing a Reagan mask.
Six long episodes can't go by, and comedy isn't quick enough or often enough.
While Gregor and Iosef were constantly visiting the American embassy, where there were two fat men who always ate a bunch of hungry hamburgers in their lobby, "Comrade Detective" could do better to fulfill the propaganda satire if it were shortened to a narrower length.
The message to the imaginary communist watcher is that Western culture can turn anything into a series of foods to be eaten.
The fiction Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so in our own close history and even in theirs.
The Ancients were the ancestors of FETÖ
The British government has seen our family as loyal and devoted by 50 years of experience.
The government's supreme authorities have acknowledged that this family has been loyal to the British government since then and has done great service.
The British government needs to be careful and careful about this plant that it planted with its own hands, to investigate and carefully decide everything.
While trying to understand the FETÖ, the beginning point is to deal with the organisation of the Hashahish, but the important difference is that the FETÖ is an organization that emerges during the imperialist era and acts with colonialists.
In my opinion, the "frontal movement" should be addressed in this minval is the Kadians.
In the British tribute at the entrance, the man who described himself as a plant planted by the hands of the British government was Mirza Gulam Ahmet Kadiyani, founder of the Kaduyanism.
"On December 1, 1888, God ordered him to buy a pledge from his followers and to form a separate congregation," said Gulam Ahmed, a small town in Punjab, India.
Gulam Ahmed went a little further and said that in 1891, according to the revelation and inspiration that Mary died of course, like the other prophets, God had sent her away to worship and understanding that Christians and Muslims were waiting for her.
According to this, he is the same person as Mirza Gulam Ahmed, who the Muslims have been waiting for.
(Encyclopaedia of Islam, TDV)
In India, after the 1857 Sipahi uprising, he wrote books to defend persecuted Muslims against Hindus and Christians, and Gulam Ahmed reminded them of Gulen's portrait of the President of the Non-Communism Society in Erzurum, which is thought to have been founded with purely sacredist confessions, but was later revealed by the CIA.
Like Gülen, Gulam Ahmed's favorite idea of imperialists is that "cihad" is only a struggle with the Muslim's own self, and if you can live freely in religion, then imperialism has no dimension to fight.
In fact, if you recall, Gülen went one step further, even in a last year's 'vaaz' of the Crusaders, whose wounds were still open in our history, praised the attacks: "It is not too dangerous for the pilgrim to invade your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
First of all, they don't mess with your woman, they don't mess with your daughter.
They won't touch your temple, untamed Crusaders!
The idea that the Mahdi and the messiah were united, that his community would be the savior of Islam, that the concept of jihad would only mean fighting against the soul, aside from the similarity of the thesis with FETÖ, the spread of secularism in general took place in the field of education and civil society.
The number of total centres in the world, which are said to have exceeded 2 million of 'em, is listed as 1869, 23 countries where the emergency aid organisation "Humanity First" is officially recorded.
There are also 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 printing press in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries, and about 16,000 mosques in the world.
In view of the Nobel Prize-winning "first Muslim scientist" Prof. Abdulselam, the United Nations Justice Council President Sir Zaferullah Khan, the Muslim actor who won the first Oscar, Mahershala Ali, we can see more clearly the depth of the approval of global powers for the Kadueans.
Let's note that last week's meeting of the Kadians in England with 30,000 people was also polished as a body display.
One of their slogans is a short look at their history to understand that the Kadians, who are saying, "Love everyone, don't hate anyone", actually want to say, "Love your invaders/ your colonials."
It is possible to extend the origins and motivations of such constructions as Hullahasa, FETÖ or Tahir-ul Kadri to the Kadians, and all of these organisations are actually supported as an excuse to corrupt societies to serve colonialism and thereby encroach on imperialism.
It's a "last request" from the cargo.
Emily Pomeranz (50), who spent her last days in a hospital in Washington because of pancreatic cancer, expressed her longing for a coffee and chocolate shake (milk shake) at a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of hers contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has been running the same restaurant for 47 years, put the drink on dry ice and shipped it to the hospital, which is also worth $123 (435) and shipped it to "fast delivery" to the hospital 600km away.
Two new projects by Ahmet Kul
To date, Ahmet Kul Construction, which has implemented important projects such as Lavinya Park, Autoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has launched projects such as Dia Mare in Istanbul, and Solse 7 in Bodrum Yalubavacak.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, developed by Architecture Pineoğlu Architecture, was developed to take maximum benefit from the sea.
A total of 188 dwellings and 17 commercial units are located on an area of 11,000 square meters.
The project, which is completely finished, will be handed over to its new owners on March 2018th.
Dia Mare has multiple circles that vary from 2+1 to 5+1.
In 2018, the company is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkapi, which will activate two new construction sites in Mimaroba and Bitez later this year.
He's transferred 753 million to the subsidiary companies.
At TRT, where 6,760 employees work, Barış said many programmes were being made outside and extreme prices were paid.
CHP deputy has again raised taxes on AKP-based companies in "TRT 2016".
"It's called robbery," he said...
The source TRT transferred to its subsidiary production companies was revealed through data obtained from official documents.
The official response to CHP İstanbul MP Barış Y friend's application under the Information Act has revealed how TRT's resources are being spent.
In the TRT, where 6,760 people work as staff, he said that despite all technical possibilities, it had been transferred to all side companies through external construction programmes in 2016.
The CHP deputy used the phrase, "This means profit."
"The production companies of AKP journalists and businessmen are looting TRT."
He said, "Millions are paid for productions that are not monitored or withdrawn."
"The institution with 7,000 employees has turned into AKP barley," he reminded companies that the money being transferred was collected from the taxes of the people."
"What programs did these companies sign up for that 7,000 people couldn't?" he reacted.
He explained that TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 was $224,456,182.
"TRT, who became the voice of AKP, can't get commercials because it's not being watched."
Feeding journalists receive money from TRT, scream for the AKP.
He said, "The people are pulling the weight."
"TRT pays staff a salary of $660m annually, but it gives all the work to external productions."
From TRT, the public's pocket, 753.5 trillion followers.
That's a complete disgrace.
He gave up suicide, kneeled before his wife and apologized.
The incident took place today at noon in a parking lot in Eyüpoğlu neighborhood, Değirmen Street.
According to information, residents have reported the situation to fire and medical teams, who saw a citizen hanging down from the 4th floor of the parking lot.
Fire brigades on the scene opened tarps to the area where the person was found, while medical teams were ready.
The father of three 34-year-olds, Jonah G., who had stopped committing suicide after nearly an hour of convincing by psychologists and police teams who were called to the scene, kneeled down before his wife, N.G., who watched him in tears.
At the same time, about 100 people sat on the sidewalks on the street where Jonah G., who attempted to commit suicide, while some citizens recorded on their cell phones.

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%.
Soon, the interest rates will not change, after Bank of England reduces speculation that slow economic growth and moving inflation will be an increase.
Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue "slow", as family revenues are reduced and their interest rates remain constant.
The decisionmakers at the Bank's Financial Policy Committee (MPC) voted two-for-six percent to keep interest at 0.25%, so that, after slow economic growth weakened support for the increase, less members this month demanded an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank raised growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018, and warned that household revenues will continue to contract, with inflation still expected to increase by 3% in the spring.
However, he signaled that interest increases in the next few years could be needed to rein in the inflation Brexit has fueled, and said debt costs may have to increase more in financial markets than expected.
They also voted after Brexit to withdraw a portion of the massive economic healing package launched a year ago.
The bank said it will end the Periodal Funding Plan, which offers cheap financing to banks from next February, but it expects to present £15 billion more (to total £115 billion) within the framework of the plan.
"The centre of the MPC is slow in the short term, in the forecast, with the gross domestic revenue (GSYH) continuing to be a burden on consumption of domestic real income," the bank said minutes after the interest decision was made.
In terms of interest, he stressed that "a little reduction in monetary policy" could be necessary to reduce inflation and that the market would be "a little higher" than expected.
Markets are still predicting that the first increase will be in the third quarter of next year and that someone else will be in 2020.
However, the bank stresses that any increase will be "step by step" and "limited".
According to estimates in May, the bank's reduced growth estimates for this year and next year are compared to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintains its estimate of 1.8% per 2018.
After the report, Sterling lost value to dollars and euros.
The pound dropped 0.5% and was $1.31 U.S. dollars and 0.4%.
The decision not to change came after GDP reduced the growing expectations of increasing growth, with 0.2% in the previous three months, compared to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The growth will probably remain 0.3% in the third quarter, but according to the bank, it will begin to increase slightly by the end of the year.
The bank says the contraction will get worse before it recovers, leaving little joy to households who were shot by the latest inflation report, increased inflation and small salary increases.
The bank said the monetary policy "can't prevent the shooting of revenues" in the next few years, but it expects salaries to improve "to a significant extent" towards the end of its three-year projections.
As a result of the weak pounds, the increased demand for British goods will balance some of the reduced consumer spending to support the economy.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were reduced to 0.25% in August following the EU referendum vote, which brought the pound upside-down.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully affect prices and the economy.
Before the bank's latest interest decision, there was a demand for increased inflation pressure on the struggling households and a rising interest increase of three policy makers, calling for 0.5% in July.
Inflation dropped from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected and would increase once again in the coming months.
According to their 2% goal, the vaccine is "completely" related to the weak pounds, the bank said.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "The mortgage market will once again become more competitive, given the recent declines in taxi rates, when the lenders have a demand for business and a positive closure of the year.
Sunday is becoming more popular in mortgages, especially for those who are nearing the end of their current contracts, with lots of free options and low interest."
NHS will prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
In the Supreme Court, after a struggle to finance the drug at NHS, patients will be able to achieve 'translating' HIV prevention treatment from September.
The NHS announced that the pre-experience profile (PREP), a drug taken prior to sex, dropped the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86 per cent, would be provided to approximately 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
The Supreme Court agreed to finance the experiment after the Supreme Court approved it last year. The ruling said NHS had the power to pay for the PREP, despite claims that local authorities financed it.
This move, announced on Thursday, was welcomed by NHS British president Simon Stevens as a 'new and serious intervention', while National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a turning point.
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to record the public, with more clinics participating in October, and will be fully implemented throughout England by April 2018.
Pre-injury profile (PREP) is a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of HIV infection before sex.
Tests showed that the PREP significantly reduces HIV transfer among those at risk of infection.
Taking PREP before sex means that one person has enough drugs in his system to prevent HIV infection.
These drugs can be taken every day or almost two hours before they have sex.
The appropriate ones for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will determine appropriate participants from men, women, transsexual individuals, and from unknown people whose HIV status is controlled by an anti-retroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered to a GP will be able to register for potential participation in local sexual health clinics.
The programme will cost £10 million, and NHS signed an agreement this week to provide medicine with an international tender for England.
The test was designed to assess the full potential of the PREP by collecting clinical evidence on how the PREP was targeted, conducted and implemented at a large scale.
'This new and serious intervention will contribute to extensive and increasing successful efforts in preventing HIV,' said Mr Stevens.
This is another milestone in the 30-year development of overcoming one of humanity's major health problems.'
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If targeted correctly in those who need it and those who are at risk, PREP offers the possibility of transforming the HIV epidemic in Britain.
From September, people who are at high risk of HIV will be able to reach a new and powerful vehicle that is actually privately controlled and not open to negotiation with a spouse through this experiment funded by NHS in Britain; this will lead to the recovery of many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly.'
Ian Green, president of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority now is to ensure that the experiment is presented quickly across the country and that no one who is at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PREP experimental drug has been supplied, we are on the right path to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk for HIV.'
'We welcome the start of the PREP experiment, and it is late with months of delays and then the government's insistence.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be in our view of the prevention of HIV and the end of this life-changing infection.
The experiment will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PREP.
Now it's important that this experiment protects those exposed to HIV and is presented as quickly as possible across the country to bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.

Two secrets, death.
The daughter of former Minister of Industry and Commerce Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, Umit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51) lost her life from the 19th floor of a business centre used as a hotel in Levent, Istanbul.
Koç University student Melis Salihoğlu, 24, was also found dead in his home.
It was claimed that Salihoğlu hanged himself.
Two secret killings, one after the other, considered suicide by the police, have been investigated.
'THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN CONTINUEED'
İmit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, daughter of Turkey's first Industrial and Trade Minister Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, who served in the government of Nihat Erim in 1971, arrived at Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler at 5 p.m. on August 1.m.
An ambulance and police team were called to the scene after a Kuwaiti tourist who had settled in the room on the 19th floor and had seen the lifeless body of Çilingiroğlu, who had not been heard from for some time.
Paramedics determined that Çilingiroğlu, who fell from 19th floor to hard ground, had lost his life.
"The mother who testified to the police, Medihha Çilingiroğlu, "has recently been depressed."
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on 31 July.
I have a grandson with leukemia from my other daughter.
He said, "This was taking care of my grandson, and he was negatively affected by my grandson's illness."
Çilingiroğlu is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It's being investigated whether the locksmithoğlu was dumped by someone or committed suicide.
'WHISPERED' DEFENSE
Another suspicious death in Istanbul occurred in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoğlu (24) who studied at Koç University was found dead in his home.
The young girl's father allegedly went to his daughter's house near the school, where she couldn't hear from her and couldn't reach her cell phone.
Father met his daughter's dead body at home.
It was claimed that Melis, who was loved by his family, close relatives and friends, hanged himself in his home and ended his life.
The death of Melis Salihoğlu has overwhelmed his family and relatives.
After Melis, a friend of his was on social media saying, "A bright sun was shining in our faces."
The green grass under our feet, your best friend Jack and your sister Eyshan, we were in a good mood when we were chasing that little plastic ball.
He shared the message, "What was the point of dying now?"
Living a life of luxury: hanging floor and smart design tricks that turned this little Earls Courts apartment into a spacious home.
In 2014, Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate renovations, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to a small apartment in Earls Court.
It's on the first floor of a fancy Queen Anne-style gazebo, and it's proof of the new design Joanne was convinced of before she packed her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in a much bigger area in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something equivalent to my price.
The apartment at Earl Court was shown to me, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him and made an offer that day."
After the first sighting, a thousand square feet of circle was restored from top to bottom.
In the beginning, it was a one-bedroom and complex planned property, and you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom, and Joanne wanted to add a hiding space and a pad to make maximum use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my condition," he said.
To this end, the Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed hired Erfan Azadi to take advantage of the 12.5 ft ceiling and create not only a structure but also a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to add two spaces in a row, so the architectural challenge was to create a vine floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the matter.
"The steel skeleton is very complicated," he explains.
"We had to adjust the gaps so that they could pile up without having to lean down on each other.
It wasn't just building a platform, it was also going to bend steel so much that they would be right up to the top or bottom function."
This arrangement also brought many additional dramas to allow Erfan to get two full-size rooms above each other.
The old copper light window, taken from Retrouvius for the vine floor, looks down at the magnificent habitat below.
The mirrored gold furniture, the silver accents and the old Serge Mouille lighting all determine the style of the bill.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding space, space and light.
Mirrors placed at both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
The mirrored guard panel in the kitchen makes it feel like a window to another room.
The mirrored units in the lobby provide a storage area for Joanne's entire cutlery and her zucchini.
The beauty of the living room that creates a more spectacular field perception is to close the kitchen when it's not in use.
Open-and-shut kitchens aren't new.
What's original about this is that it's a garage-style upliftable door.
Erfan explains the steel-powered polished MDF door, "We used some engineering in this one."
"It's got a weight on it, so when you push the door up, it really slides."
With the clever use of the area and the storage area, Joanne won an additional 16 square feet, an extra bedroom, and an improved session plan.
"At the end of the day, the session area becomes what you will sell, or your property will be valued," Erfan says.
"As an ideal, a real estate agent will go in and make a calculation in the area of the session."
Here, as they increased the ground area, they were able to use quality material to give the area a luxurious view.
"The goods are objects you touch, and it will help you to bond emotionally at home," Erfan says.
"At home, you don't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't shake the strings of your heart."
It's proof that a circle can turn from something standard to something pretty amazing through good design and increased square meters.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens in Beşiktas
After a month and a half of talks, he was transferred to Besiktaş with a Lens service, originally considered a rental.
Lens has agreed with the black-and-white team in exchange for the price of 5m euros in service, following the last week's intensive talks.
A five-year deal has been learned that the Dutch player will receive 2.2m euros annually.
Beşiktas is expected to make an official statement regarding the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Photos of famous couples' weddings
For nearly four years, the model Kağla Shekel and actor and singer Emre Altuğ, who had had an up and down relationship, entered the world home in Sortie.
The couple immortalized the wedding ceremony with what they called "the most special moment of our lives."
The couple decided to split up after seven years.
The brothers are fighting over a $500 million estate empire.
Two brothers are at war for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, 40 years after the dynasty of Italian families.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who gave himself to the Supreme Court on how to divide property and business assets in a mansion in Toorak.
Paul had wanted out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court continued to have strong arguments about the disintegration.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties that have been worth more than half a billion dollars since they bought a store in Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and raised him in a chain with 160 retail sales centers.
Sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been deposited and De Lutis' portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento construction sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and malls in the suburbs.
Under an agreement with their deceased father, Colin has two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul has one third of the company's assets (which is described by Paul as "a significant driving force and a dominant personality" in the De Lutis family.
A court file says it means that Colin has $316 million and Paul has 176 million worth of property.
Splitting property and cash for Paul is a controversial issue.
In his first deposition in 2015, he wrote: "The divisions proposed by Colin were leaving him with the properties I always considered to be the best."
Last Friday, after many failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also fighting over who controls the current business; Paul claims Colin left him out of it.
Colin argues that's not true, but he's accusing Paul of being incompetent to manage certain properties.
Colin says in a sworn statement he initially hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots tell me that family is the most important priority."
Hundreds of pages of depositions, e-mails, and top lawyers, Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal advisers, including Delotte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, are increasing in the case.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were an Italian immigrant family running grocery stores and delis since the late 1950s, and they bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They pawned Colin's property to buy the Collingwood property where the family opened the first jean shop.
Colin says he founded Westco there when Paul was a little boy in high school.
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to leave their property to their sons as friends.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted brothers in court."
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the De Lutis company group; Colin said that when he quit, Mark was paid $10 million, and Luke was paid $26 million.
Paul said both Luke and Mark were "unsatisfied with the terms of their financial separation."
According to Eddi McGuire, the TV star's best friend, in 2015, Colin tried to keep a low profile even though he was a former AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and his lawyers on Friday.
Just because Colin was in court with a text message, he replied, "I can't say much."
"It must have been very, very sad when my brother Paul chose to sue me and drag our family's name into court."
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a court of law that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I to have the current disagreement," he said, adding that he was still hopeful about the solution.
This hope seems to have disappeared on Friday.
"Our problem will soon be solved by the courts," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media diet.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do this.
It would be the first time.
Politico says the new White House chief will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports) in hopes of keeping the boss more stable.
Here's some little information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new chief of staff at the White House, met with senior staff on his first day at work, President Donald Trump summed up a fundamental problem he was planning to solve with the White House: bad information in the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that information, whether on paper or briefings, had to flow through her, because the president could make better decisions when given good information.
Kelly's diagnosis makes a lot of sense, but others tried to tame Trump by auditing his media diet and failed.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and now he's in the White House, watching TV is still in good shape.
"If Aday Trump was upset about not being fair in the media, showing him that he had found a fair place in convincing media outlets was more productive," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser to Politico, told Politico in February.
"The key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control at the time, according to six campaign workers from Politico, was to ensure that personal media consumption contained a stable flow of praise," Tara Palmeri wrote.
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any given time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't, like Trump's tweets would be a lot more provocative without their interference.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his employees could get him out of danger a few times, then his efforts were valuable.
But no one was able to stop Trump from creating a constant debate.
Part of the problem was the White House's competing faction, which, in any case, was trying to move their own agenda forward with the materials they presented to Trump (they could be trusted or unreliable) and bring forth their own world views.
In May, Politico reported throughout this whole story that advisors were strategically inclined to convey questionable information to the president.
Here's an example that reporter Shane Goldmacher described in detail:
"The current and former Trump officials say Trump reacted violently to negative clippings from the press, especially the leaks that had a bad effect, and was caught up in finding out where they came from.
At the end of February, it happened when someone gave the president a corrupt copy of an article that accused Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson of being the source behind a series of leaks from GotNews.com, his assistant chief of staff Katie Walsh at the White House.
It didn't matter if Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or that he'd made false accusations in the past, and that he'd come back from them.
Trump read the article and started asking the staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher, then chief of staff, Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter, added that he was "trying to install and document a system that managed and documented the documents that Trump received".
How did that work out for you?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing in three months.
Maybe he'll show up as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own impulse and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors are going to make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Crypto created FETÖ players with special templates
Izmir Chief Public Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya has completed his investigation as part of the investigation into the "illegal espionage investigation" and the leaking of some information.
In contrast to the fact that Major Admiral Yaycı is not a member of the organization, the study emphasised that he has assisted in the discovery of members of the crypto organisation at the Navy Command and has been active in the fight against FETÖ.
The decision that the Yaycı was trying to be disabled by order of the Navy Command following the so-called martial law order in the coup attempt on July 15th underlined the fact that he was actively fighting against FETÖ from the first day of the coup attempt.
"It has been understood that the Yağcı has been working on the detection of crypto Naval Command personnel through a special template for the detection of members of the crypto-private service class and a special system that has been set up through 64 basic criteria and through 209 subspecies."
It has been concluded that an estimate of an active terrorist organization known as an anti-terrorist, whose major contribution to the case has been made by our prosecutor's office, where a special and stubborn effort has been observed, and there is no evidence about the secret witness, except that it has been declared apocalyptic and unfounded basis, has been found that it is not possible to be appreciated by our attorney general.
Vice Admiral Yayci has been charged with defamation before.
And it turned out that the FETÖ were behind it again and that the alleged crime was a conspiracy.
Former Air Pilot Chief Hakan Dinc, who complained that Yaycı had insulted him, turned the complaint into a document in the form of an information note in the form of an old Adana İncirlik 10.
Tanker Base Commander Air Pilot Brigadier General Bakir Ercan Van, former Chief of Staff Chief of General Staff Chief of Staff Colonel Muharrem Köse, former Chief of Staff General Mustafa Özsoy, former Judge Major Erkan Aksoy, who gave permission to prosecute, former Lieutenant Commander Necmettin Aksoy and former Judge Chief of Staff Chief of Staff Chief of Staff General Serdar Çami Köse have been released as witnesses from the Supreme Court against Mustafa Çiçi, former Chief of Staff Chief of Intelligence on the investigation team, and former Chief of Staff Chief of Staff General Staff General Staff Chief of Staff General Staff General Staff General Staff General Staff Mustafa Özsoy, former Lieutenant Commander Necmettin Aksoy, who gave permission to prosecute.
Some members of the organisation, including the FETÖ fugitive Tuncay Opcin, were found to have targeted Yaycı, both before and after the coup attempt on July 15th.
Travelers crossed the moat, went back to 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the richest homeowners in the West Midlands are fighting again with determined travelers who have been dug up by the council to take back the area outside their mansion.
Travelers parked 20 caravans outside of a area called Solihull's "rich neighborhood", where Solihull's still on the right street.
They returned in May after being fired by the council, bringing horses, babies, and loads of wagons from the ditch they dug to cut off their raids.
The clever group found a gap in the defense, leaking their vehicles through a section that was left unblocked.
The angry residents criticised the Solihull Council, saying it was useless to solve the problem.
"They arrived Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.
The council should be ashamed of their actions because they're useless to solve the problem.
The Travelers were there in May, they were sent away, and now they're back.
More came last night, and more will probably come today."
He added: 'The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with long suspension decisions to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street, and I'm not happy to continue paying my taxes when the council can't even stop it.'
A local resident who didn't want to give his name said, 'Like a joke, we saw the last group of travelers had just left, and we were immediately devastated by a new group.
Their numbers increased this time, and a horse was even seen grazing in the parking lot.'
A woman from the Solihull Council said, 'We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on Street Street property, and we are starting legal proceedings to get them out of there as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it's very important that as many residents call 101 and report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
'This will help bring out a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to the court.'
Galatasaray reported Ndiaye to the stock market.
According to a statement sent to Istanbul by Galatasaray Sportif Sanai and Trade Investments Inc. on the Public Lighting Platform, the yellow-red club will pay Ottomanspor 7m,500 euros for the player's bonus price, if he plays a total of 25 games in the league, in Europe, 750,000, if he plays another 750,000 euros.
Galatasaray will pay a total of 11m euros guaranteed to Ndiaye, who signed a four-year contract, with 2m750,000 euros per year.
In addition, Ndiaye will receive 5,000 euros in bonuses for each single score by the yellow-red team in the TFF Super League and UEFA competitions.
The player has a unilateral right to terminate the contract from June 15, 2019, for 18m euros, the statement announced.
Last-day rush!
They flocked to fire stations.
Thousands of vehicles were damaged in Istanbul last Thursday, along with the storm and hail.
Many of the drivers who received reports from the fire department for the damages to be covered by insurance companies have made their reports, while drivers who have not received reports so far have queued for the report.
Drivers who were in the casino today and did not report came to the fire stations and requested a report because it was the last day of the notice.
Today is the last day
First, the drivers had fire marshals take pictures of their vehicles to determine the damage to their vehicles.
The drivers who had damaged their vehicles later filed a report to the authorities.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, "I've got a recording. I'm going to take a picture."
It was busy when I got here.
"There was damage to the windshield," he said.
Driver Erbil Sword, "We're here to rush."
We're in line.
We took the picture.
"Now we wait for the report," he said.
Skydials, walled by sea and land, can't breathe.
"The expert report in the case clearly says that these structures will not withstand an earthquake of 6 magnitudes," CHP Councilwoman Nadir Ataman warned of the huge building rising on the beach.
The stakes where the solid rock is 25 to 30 meters below are not marked this deep.
İstanbul Ataköy has left the district without breath, building a wall between the sea and land on the beach.
MP Nadir Ataman of Bakırköy Municipality of CHP reacted to the huge mall, hotel and residence projects that rose one after the other in the district.
"80 years ago, those planning according to the wind created the Atatürk Forest for Floria.
80 years later, they planted giant skyscrapers in the wind corridors and changed the climate, just as they reached the point of urbanism.
He said, "There's no breathing in there."
"The temperature is 10 degrees higher because of the skyscrapers."
These buildings must be built according to the direction of the winds.
But our skyscrapers are rising above Istanbul's wind corridors.
The wind can't get into the county.
These constructions are destabilizing natural life.
Ataman noted that these skyscrapers that have damaged the environment and human health have also cut off the connection of the Bakırköy people to the sea, saying they will appeal to the Council of Monuments on the subject and go to the judicial path.
There's an inoperable cure for pubic hair.
In cases that have been applied to phenol, success has reached 83 per cent.
In this way, the diseased tissue is effectively wiped clean and the tissue cavity is filled with an agent who kills hair roots.
One of the treatment techniques for non-operable hair spinning is the laser method.
With various lasers, hair roots and tissue around it are burned by circular scattering rays, which allow tissue to be glued shut down during the burn.
Thanks to these two non-operable methods of pubic disease, patients can return to social and professional life in less time.
Dr. Mert Atak, who noted that excessive weight, sedentary life, long-term sit-down work, intense hair and body hair and not following hygiene rules led to hair spinning, claimed that the symptoms of the disease include pain, infection, abscesss and swelling.
Italy hardens NGOs' approach to immigrant rescue boats
The NGOs, which run immigrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean, Italy, warned that if they do not comply with new rules that affect their operations, they will not be allowed to continue.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new charter, it will be difficult to see them continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities suspected of actively co-operating with human traffickers, making illegal migration easier on a boat run by the German aid company Jugend Rettet.
The aid agency, which has only been active for a year, has refused to comment on the contents of the detailed accusations filed against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"The saving of human life for us is our top priority and it will be, so we are very sorry that we cannot work in the search and rescue zone right now," the agency said in a statement on social media.
"We can only evaluate the charges that are currently being carried out after collecting all the information and assessing the situation."
Italian authorities have been tracking Jugend Rettet's boat Iuventa since October.
The crew is suspected of taking rubber boots full of immigrants, delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and allowing smugglers to escape on boats to be used again.
According to the prosecutor's files published by the Italian media, at least one such meeting took place about 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The crew is charged with disregarding the authority of Italian coast guard, who oversees rescue operations in the region for more human efforts than for any other purpose.
According to the charter, there should be an Italian police officer on the deck of boats like Iuventa, who clearly oversees their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the charter so far: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
On Tuesday, the last one said he assessed that new rules are unnecessary but acceptable because they would not cause any "serious change or obstacle" in his rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign are the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp decline in the number of immigrants arriving in Italy after the rescues in the past weeks shows that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal security and co-operation with local governors have paid off.
"We have recently begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
This month, he announced plans to discuss more economic development initiatives with Libyan governors, and to take measures to reduce the number of immigrants who left Chad, Niger and Mali and those countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Last-minute punch!
In Moscow, Russia's capital, the celebrations of "paratroopers' day" were eaten watermelons, as was every year, and drank vodka.
At the event, a Russian alcoholic attacked Russian NTV television reporter Nikita Razvozjayev, who broadcast live in Gorki Park.
The reporter on live television warned the man who suddenly appeared and said, "We will contain Ukraine" and said, "Please shut up."
The drunk man, mentioned to be a former paratrooper, punched him hard on the reporter's warning.
The reporter, who was stunned by the punch he took, tried to get away from him.
Millions of people saw the shock on the air.
Economic Co-ordination Board convened
The Economic Co-ordination Board (ECK) met with Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek in charge of the economy.
Following the government's cabinet change, the first ECK meeting, which was held under the leadership of Simsek, began at the Çankaya Mansion at 6:30 p.m.
The meeting will discuss Turkey's macroeconomic outlook.
Minister of Finance Naci Agbal, Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Labour and Social Security Jülide Sarıeroğlu, Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci, Minister of Development Lutfi Elvan, Undersecretary of Treasury Osman Çelik, Central Bank President Murat Çetinkaya and the bureaucrats involved.
It's possible to get rid of the hernia in 45 minutes.
“The first step, according to the patient’s examination and imaging results, is rest and medication,” says Assoc. Prof. Dr. Oğuz Karaemin, who noted that only 5 per cent of patients should be operated on during hernia treatment.
"If all these methods fail, if the numbness and weakness of the legs become evident, then surgery is mandatory," he warned, warning that initiativeal methods (such as imperial injection, radiofrequency techniques, disk initiatives) should be tested.
Karaemin’s children also say that it is possible to get rid of the hernia disease in 45 minutes, saying that 'full-closed hernia surgery', which reduces the risk to the least today, also allows invasive patients to lower their reservations about the surgery.
Although microscopic surgery and open surgery have been quite good results, there may be complications, such as long recovery after the operation, spinal congestion, recurrence of the hernia, and a future slip and infection.
Most of the time, microscopic surgery is described as closed surgery, but microscopic surgery is applied with the same approach as open surgery.
And in full-closed hernia surgery, the environmental tissues are preserved, so those risks are gone.
Full-on hernia surgery only lasts 45 minutes.
Special commission in charge
CHP MPs Mehmet Göldag, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Barış Yüksel and High Disciplinary Board member Turan Aydoğan will be included in the commission.
On October 4th, the Commission ruled in İstanbul 14th of Berberoğlu.
He will follow his trial at the High Criminal Court and his appeals to the Constitutional Court and the District Instigation Court.
"The independence and impartiality of the judiciary is the essential condition of justice that no one takes orders except the law," CHP Secretary-General Kamil Okyayy Sinin and Vice President Bülent Tezcan wrote in the letter of the commission.
"Mr. Enis Berberoglu has not demanded any special status while acting as a deputy, has not taken refuge in the immunity armor recognised by the MP, has wanted to maintain his faith in the independence and neutrality of the judiciary," he said.
The process of judicial action has been suggested that the court would rather follow political orders than bring them to trial.
The article argued that the court’s decision to arrest MPs before the verdict was finalised is clear evidence that the court has taken a decision under the influence.
Michelle Carter was punished for sending messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will be sentenced to 15 months of imprisonment and five years of legal discharge.
In June 2014, Carter was convicted of the murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to be released with a clear path of reference.
Although he was facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, his legal team argued that both he and Mr. Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Carter, wearing a red pants and a creamy blouse, was punished with old eyes, with hemlocked hands and eyes facing the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
He ended his life to heal his own.
He didn't accept the responsibility," he said.
"He showed no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation that he completely regretted."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see that his age, maturity level, even mental illness had any significant impact on his actions.
A prosecutor read a statement by Mr. Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying, "I don't have a day to mourn the loss of my dear son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm handling everything, and I'm trying to be there for his sisters with all the pain we're going to carry forever."
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that the fact that she could never attend her brother's wedding, or that she could never be at his children's, "is not out of her mind."
He said, "The person you've been with every day since I was born, the fact that there's no more, is a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life."
Since there's no Massachusetts law to convict a person of committing suicide, it looks like he's going to file a lawsuit.
Mr. Roy was 17 when he was found dead in a car in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning.
The case attracted national attention when it revealed that Carter's text messages encouraged him to end his own life.
When he was on vacation with his family, in several of his texts two weeks before his death, she said, "Hang yourself, jump out of a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there's a lot of ways."
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz instructed the press not to allow him to profit from this case, saying Carter wanted attention through Mr. Roy's death.
The case interrupted legal opinion.
Among the minorities defending Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of killing her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox (30) published an article in the Los Angeles Times saying, "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and assistance, not imprisonment."
A dramatic growth estimate by Mehmet Simsek
In his statement, Simsek said inflation in Turkey should be reduced to low single-digit figures, and food inflation constitutes a "risk field".
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation will drop below 7 per cent in 2018.
In his speech, Lightning said:
The decrease in uncertainty is critical for the next 12 months.
The greatest incentive is to reduce uncertainty.
There's a strong government.
No political uncertainty.
I hope that the uncertainty in our nearby geography will decrease.
With some reform, we can increase our resistance to shock, and I believe we can put Turkey on a trend of over 5 per cent growth.
I told you months ago.
Because the worst is over.
Gradually, it's not about those areas we're getting our energy into, it's about the growth of our energy, it's about the reforms that will allow employment to increase.
So the next 12 months are critical.
Reform, on the one hand, is reduced by uncertainty, and there is no political uncertainty.
Hopefully, we'll get lucky and less trouble in our nearby geography.
Many of our classic markets have collapsed, whether we like it or not.
Libya, like Iraq.
We're not just losing Sunday, we're dealing with over 3.5 million migration waves.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown 5.7% despite all the shocks.
Turkey, I mean, we have our foundations, we have our problems.
Now, with some reform, we can increase our resistance to shocks, and some more questions in investors' heads, and put Turkey back on a growing policy of over 5%.
To be honest, I've got a very generous retirement system here.
I think it's reasonable to say our retirement companies aren't trying hard enough.
For one thing, auto participation will be a strong performance.
Why?
Because we took precautions.
Companies don't have to go and make an effort and spend money.
We've been working on these concerns, considering the poor performance, how we're going to devote global assets to what investment areas.
You know, the deposits are high.
Once again, there will be a performance in addition to the 25 per cent of the state.
Plus the rest of it on the treasure paper, where the risk is usually low.
When we look at the big picture, I think there's going to be a lot of interest next semester.
Because they'll see the performance.
There's not a failure in the other field, there's a success.
We restructured BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, $70 billion in savings.
Let's face it, the system's been successful.
There are 2.6 million participants in automatic participation, and $775 million in savings.
We want a little more effort from the firms.
Let them do some publicity, tell us about this system.
We're working on the cayma.
Maybe if we stretch him out a little...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe the citizens will see the revenue, see the savings and stay in the system.
It's 38 percent out of the system.
Almost half of those who leave are voluntary individual pensioners.
You don't want two individual retirement accounts.
What are you doing?
You're quitting auto turnout.
We were actually expecting a retraction around 10 percent.
Which means we were very optimistic.
Once the system works.
We brought a premium ceiling.
Insurance companies sometimes explain one-sided things.
They've raised their premiums too fast.
When we asked what was going on, they said the judicial decisions didn't take into account the existing arrangements.
We've just made a clear arrangement.
So we said, "Do what you have to do."
They said no, we wait for judgment.
So we said that's not how it works.
We have our differences here.
Of course, when this ceiling went through the premium app, some firms ruled it out.
We've made a new arrangement.
We built a pool of risky insurance.
Let me just say it, let me repeat it.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
I mean, I don't think these ceiling prices are right, they forced us to.
I want us to look at this in three dimensions.
Consider the system we've built.
Two, let the system function normally, a price on that path.
On top of that, the charges are heavy, almost $30 to $31 of every $100 premium paid goes to tax tax cuts.
I'm working right now, so we're gonna talk to our finance minister.
Third, technology is evolving rapidly.
And now, with time, traffic accidents will be severely reduced structurally.
But this is mandatory traffic insurance.
SABAH's headline saved his leg
Buger’s illness, which emerged from puberty, was a condition that used to occur in men, but today it has become common in women.
One of these women is the 36-year-old Mehtap Dursun.
The pain that started two years ago became chronic in the soles of his feet.
The young woman, struggling to walk, went to the hospital at the risk of losing her leg.
A friend recommended Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
"Azerbaycan has saved the life of the Minister of Extraordinary State", headlined in SABAH.
So it turned out that Dursun, who went to Kalko, was struggling with Bueger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko has taken the young woman into emergency surgery.
Soon after, Dursun recovers from his pain, he is now in oxygen treatment.
The Audi Modified 850,000 Diesel Tools While Auto Manufacturers Face Reverse Reaction
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades in over 350,000 vehicles.
The head of the BMW board said the company believes there are "more intelligent options than the driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including Munich, which includes the BMW's centre (the ban or limitation of private vehicles).
Daimler said on Tuesday he would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described these moves as recalls.
European car manufacturers strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are considered cancer-making and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment automotive companies need to put on to neutralize the dirty smoke from diesel vehicles is increasing, and the price of automobiles makes it difficult to remain competitive.
While German car manufacturers face reviews, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has been charged with spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring the implications of the problem.
Companies try to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, which conceal the device known as a decoy device and adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car is tested.
Many Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in the Audi engine development department, the former president of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore is not protected from extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, when authorities accused Audi of installing a system to avoid emissions in Europe, and expanded the United States-based investigation.
The fact that Audi was involved in the investigation may be too much for Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer has a huge share in Volkswagen's profits.
Don't jump at everything you see
The head of the Turkish Association for Neurosurgy, Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, warned not to jump from six feet to shallow, not to be sure of its depth.
Every year, thousands face the risk of paralysis due to neck fractures and spinal injury due to diving into shallow waters.
Neck fractures are most common in the 5th or 6th vertebrae.
The property of the fractures is that at this level it affects the muscles of the arms and legs as well as the nerves that feed the respiratory muscles.
"In accidents like this, our most valuable organ, the neck spinal cord, is cut off by the spinal cord that was broken because of the fracture, or compressed, which is defunct."
"The wrong first aid in spinal injuries can not only increase damage to the victims but also lead to death," he said.
Diving into the water ranks fourth in spinal injuries.
The average age of the wounded is 20 to 29 years, and most of them are male.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar said, "It mustn't jump into invisible water."
He said, "No matter how well he dives, he could get a serious injury."
Prof. Dr. Çağlar also reminded me:
Depending on the spinal cord level of the damage caused by the dive, there may be different levels of paralysis in the arms and legs.
You may be able to swim, but water can be deceiving.
What seems to be deep to you may be shallow.
The warning signs placed on the coasts of the United States and Australia have reduced 70 per cent in cases of diving into shallow water.
"Although 28 provinces in Turkey have coasts of sea, there are not even a warning signs in places outside Istanbul," Prof. Dr. Çağlar said.
"In regard to these life-drenching accidents, every province must be kept in a remarkable way under the health directorship, schools and social awareness project in every province before summer," he said.
The head of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association Spinal and Peripheric Neurosurgery Group, Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, has suggested that the following things be done in case of injury:
112 should be called first thing at the time.
The neck should be held as steady as possible, not moved, not detected with a hard collar.
The airway must be provided and the patient must be turned upside down for the draining of the water to the lung.
He shouldn't be held by the legs and held down to drain the water.
The deformity on the patient's neck shouldn't be tried to fix it.
C-spine vertebrae could be broken.
However, if the spinal cord hasn’t been damaged yet, an inappropriate position to be placed on the neck during first aid and the transfer of the patient may cause broken bone fragments to compress and damage the spinal cord.
Provence lavender under threat of climate change
He had become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is under threat of climate change.
Lavender suffers from drought-like conditions and a decline in insects that carry disease, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "The lavender in Provence has been effectively compromised because in recent years the plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings much less in spring and mostly in autumn.
It's affecting the lavender's life.
There's also a small cicada, a leaf pest that transmits microbacterium, and there's a lot of them in very dry weather."
And a lot of things are at stake.
As much perfume and cosmetics as vacationers do, they're going after lavender oil.
Eric Chaisse said, "We have smaller, less developed, less developed, or weak ears when we should have very long plant ears with a few large flowers.
So we've got a little bit less essential fat."
The proposed solutions include better distribution of water and slowing evaporation from the ground, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of slime and water and developing more resistant species to dry conditions.
Journalist's murder underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The weekly newspaper, Riodoce's staff, usually meets on Wednesdays to review the latest turmoil created by organised crime in the province of Sinaloa, corrupt officers and the plans for endless drug wars in the paper.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedies, they gathered to discuss their safety.
They were told it was important that they change their routine.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: bringing their children with them to the office of a grenade target in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to offer names for each column; they don't need any proof, perceptions and internal voices are enough.
Reporters suspected of drug traffickers, politicians, business people, government, or cartels, are the bad guys who made it dangerous to write down a list of Mexico's chaos in the paper.
There are no interruptions in violence, as the number of bodies increases across the country, more are journalists: According to the Committee for Protection of Journalists, at least 25 people have been under federal protection since President Enrique Pena Nieto took over in December 2012; 589 have been under federal protection since the attacks and threats, and at least seven have died in seven states this year.
Among the recent deaths were editors and inspirational co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas, Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," writes Valdez, in one of his many books on narcotics violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is hanging on the front of Riodoce's building with a large picture of Valdez's middle finger, with the word "Justice" hanging on the front, two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing a shirt that shows his smile, his glasses, his face, and his significant Panama hat.
The workshop takes place two months before his death; reporters talk about common traumas, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, he only prosecuted two of them, according to the Committee for Protection of Journalists.
Like most of the thousands of murders committed to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists' killers are rarely brought before the law.
In Riodoce, although their hearts are broken, they insist on referring to the violence in Sinaloa even though the ground is now more deceptive.
Without knowledge of murderers, without justice, it is very little use to discuss security, says Ibarra.
"It's stupid to waste my time at this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital.
The red Toyota Corolla was able to drive only a few blocks before being stopped by two men; it was forced out of its vehicle and shot 12 times, for the name of the newspaper, probably translated the 12th River.
The gunman got in his car and drove away and was hit by a car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He's got a wife and two grown-up kids left.
Rumours in Culiacan tend to roam freely.
But there's almost nothing about Valdez but silence.
After Guzman was arrested last year and returned to the United States in January, rival groups fought to fill the gap, while Sinaloa became one of the country's bloodiest battlefields.
Never mind that every day in Sinaloa, one or many people are shot and killed, or that the cemetery is full of drug lords' fancy, two-story, bigger mausoleums than most houses to live in.
For a minute, forget the "silence" situation when only one cartel controls valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
However, despite Valdez's deep awareness of the dangers of his work, Riodoce's founding partner and director, Ismail Bojorquez (60), was devastated by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the murder.
First, on a February broadcast, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival cartel groups at war with Guzman's sons.
This article may have angered the sons; possible gang members bought every copy of the raid as soon as it was distributed to the newsstands.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper was confiscated with the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican violence against journalists.
He was alive for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste in 2013, when he joined five colleagues selling $50 shares in the discovery of Riodoce.
"It was impossible to do journalism in Sinaloa without referring tonarcotics," said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper became famous for its brave and honest news, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish vital research without fear of censorship, and readers were caught up in a publication where they could read stories that no one dared to communicate.
The Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for journalism in Latin America eight years after it was founded.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Journalists Committee for having the courage to pursue him no matter where the Mexican drug story leads.
He admits he's clearly scared.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to keep living."
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, drug smuggling in Sinaloa said, "It's a way of life."
"As a journalist, you must accept your duty. Either this or play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the one who swears like a porter, the joker, the one who's generous with his hugs and advice, the teacher who knows how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go across the hall to a bar called El Guayabo and sit at the same table all the time.
Now they ask: Is his love for his routine a downfall?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and survive.
"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean jobs, their secret aircraft track they use to transport drugs."
"These things were crossing the line," Bojorquez said.
The result was high-level self-defense and self-defense at the best of times.
Trusting your own instincts.
If something smells bad, stay away.
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, "The smell is a deceptive sensation... and what happened to Javier has happened."
He and others say the old rules in Sinaloa don't apply, as the same as Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other countries that host a toxic mix of snow smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials...
The ground changes all the time.
In the room where Riodoce staff meets for security training, all of a sudden no cell phones are allowed; it turns out that spyware sold to governments only days ago was used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers outside wanted to get rid of 104 degrees (40 Centigrat) temperature in the shadow of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to protect Riodoce's office in a four-story building in Culiacan's middle-class neighborhood.
Half serious, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were part of the 50 percent police force in which the governor himself said he wasn't trustworthy.
It's been months since reporters went to the mountainous countryside, where drug gangs were actively controlling.
In this week's issue, Riodoce examines three main stories.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother's murder in Sinaloa.
There was also exposure to government spending focused on the governor's homeland.
And then there was the kidnapping of a group at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant a block from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official explanation for who had been kidnapped or how, so when the time came to write down what everyone in the city knew, the restaurant was the favourite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
One reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the corporate revolutionary party (PRI), which dominated almost every level of politics over the past century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about earlier events, including the escape of one of "El Chapo" Guzman's sons during a military raid at the scene.
They only read it months ago, looking around Valdez's corner for the best source of information on the abduction.
Villareal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" (46), due to its fine structure, said, "We already knew what was going on before."
"All communications with our sources have been cut off at this time."
The staff is being re-used as a warehouse for banners and stickers protesting journalist killings while turning into activists for the press, something they never expected.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up some banners and showed up at the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was found, and according to DNA tests, the authorities say it's him.
Journalists across the country expressed their opinion by writing "help for the press" on sidewalks and buildings during organised protests.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, far away, trying to provide international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
From that day on, he wanted to be assigned to a mission other than doing government news, thinking that his anger had damaged his neutrality.
Valdez repeatedly said reporters in Mexico were "encirculated" by organised crime, accomplices, official officials and a reckless society.
In his last book, he called it "Narko-journalist", he wrote that journalists were being killed not only by drug gangs, but by order of politicians and security forces in co-operation with organised crime.
Media observer group Articulo 19 has linked more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials last year.
Ramirez said, "You'll die in Mexico because they want to silence you."
The murders are clearly cold showers.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
His body was found with a note that was said to have been signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news."
It's a computer keyboard and an earpiece lined up next to his severed head.
After the murder of reporter Miroslava Breach in the northern border state of Chihuahua in March, several publications such as El Norte chose to close.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after their managers were killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad called the drug cartels with the headline on the front page of Juarez: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their provinces, even the country.
It's a twisted decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still combing the streets, waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after escaping from Veracruz, they're captured by the photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City with four women in 2015.
For those of you who stay behind and continue to work, it's a daily dance with high-risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says it frightens him to report the drug trade.
"Mexican's going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter."
At midnight, a recent Saturday, as the final issue was being prepared, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, and at the same time, their phones started ringing.
A series of armed conflicts involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a beach resort, resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
As promised in a series of cartel messages around here, the war continued to escalate.
They put it on Riodoce's website through cell phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
The sirens have started beeping recently, and there's another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez quickly glanced at the police officers on watch to see if they were alert.
If they were scared, they wouldn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of their failed founders, his middle finger was on display for Sinaloa to see, and Riodoce's staff followed in his footsteps.
"How can you think about shutting it down," said Bojorquez, "when the intern asked me to send him out to do a story on the street the day Javier was killed?"
He used camouflage to avoid dinosaur enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but it's a horrible one.
Researchers have now explained that the early findings of an incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner are well preserved, and experts have described it as the 'Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
It was so well-preserved, they could tell that the stamp skin was redish brown, and they could tell that it had a "problem past".
The report in Current Biology described it as 'the best protected armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur species in the world'.
Fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived 110 million to 112 million years ago from the middle of the Cretaceous Period.
The extraordinary well-preserved situation baffled the researchers who described it as 'a truly wonderful'.
Plant-eating armoured fossil, according to reports from National Geographic, is the best preserved fossil of its own kind.
On March 21, 2011, North Alberta was found digging the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that seemed strange compared to the rock around him and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
They spent the next six years uncovering a wild animal from a mass of 2,500 pounds (2,500 kg) of land.
After such intensive work, the completed result is now ready to be revealed.
Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrell Museum where the creature was exhibited, said, 'If you squint a little, you might even believe he's asleep.'
'One of the most beautiful in science history, and as the best-preserved dinosaur species, will pass as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
Researchers examined his skin and found that even though it was coated in armor and looked like a walking tank, this plant eater was likely facing a serious threat from flesh-eating dinosaurs.
The dinosaur, which is heavily armoured, used the red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique used by many modern-day animals, known as contra-shading.
Experts say that it is being hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to blend in better and overcome its enemies.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus family was first headlined in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now completed their work and named the wild animal Borealopelta markmitchelli, dedicated to Mark Mitchell, one of the team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose him.
The extraordinary conservation of the species made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and his team of international scientists to document the shape and shape of stamps and armor on the body.
They discovered a prevalent defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top part of the creature is darker than the bottom.
Although the contrast shading is common, the findings are surprising, because the size of Borealopelta is far beyond the size of today's living contraceptive animals.
It means that the dinosaur has been pressured enough by flesh-eating dinosaurs to hunt, and evolution prefers to face it as a way of survival.
But the contraceptives are the most modern animals (e.g. deer, zebras, or armadillos), much smaller and much more revealing to be prey, which means that the nodosaur faced a serious challenge to survive.
Brown said, 'The giant, the powerful hunting of a heavily armoured animal, shows how dangerous dinosaur predators can be in the Cretaceous.'
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds on his scales also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
To find out what he ate at his last meal, scientists continue to study the animal for clues about his life, including preserved bowel contents.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where he sank to the surface of the ocean on his back.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida is today, and the rivers and oceans were probably more inland than they are now.
"The Nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely scaly leathered and preserved, while the original form of the animal is preserved in 3D," Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it; if you squint a little, you might even believe he's asleep.'
The cretaceous was when giant thermopods, the meat-eating dinosaurs on two legs, roamed the globe.
Although he was king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, who may have been hunted by some of its majestic ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, a monster that is 38 ft (11.5m) long and weighs six tons.
Scientists, whose latest findings are in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was dragged into the sea after she died and mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in North Alberta, Canada, digging Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray.
According to the museum, it's the best preserved armored dinosaur, including leather and armor, and it's complete from nose to thigh.
The creature averages around 18 ft. (5 m) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
He's got two 20-inch horns sticking out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armoured herb is wandering in the middle of nowhere in West Canada until it's washed away by a flooded river.
But the dinosaur's tomb under the sea preserved its armor in perfect detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular species have been preserved so well that the skin fragments still cover the layers of rough armor along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a containment is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at her, the more incredible it is.
Fossilized skin fragments still cover the mounded armor layers in the skull of the dinosaur.
His right front leg lies on his side, holding five fingers up.
I can count stamps on the soles of your feet."
Don't be your teeth when you want to bleach it.
White teeth and an aesthetic smile are every person's dream.
While people resort to various ways of whitening their teeth, the President of the Oral Laser Applications Association, Nükhet Berk, warns that products sold at the market or on the Internet should be avoided.
"The bleaching of teeth can be provided with chemical substances applied by dentists, or with fine porcelain surfaces that stick to the surface of teeth like nails on the surface," he said, adding that such items were drawn to the vervain surface, drawing the vervain surface and coloring the teeth so that they will never be recycled again.
While maintaining dental health prevents many diseases, aesthetic practices are also important for mental health by providing both dental and dental health care and a beautiful smile, Berk shares:
Young people’s teeth are usually white, unless there is a defect in their dental structure or genetic factors.
Because of aging, enameling, and frequent consumption of cigarettes, corrosive or dark beverages, teeth become darker over the years.
The bleaching of teeth can be provided by chemical substances applied by dentists, or by fine porcelain surfaces applied to the surface of the teeth without minimal or minimal corrosion.
Never bleach teeth with groceries or Internet products.
Because these substances draw the vervain surface, and the teeth color in a way that will never be recycled again.
From 2011 onwards, the Goatören Municipality gives elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens "The Dental and Mouth Health Service at Home".
Koksal Güngör, 65, who has lived a 24-year-old life in Goatören's Awakening Neighborhood for 24 years, said, "My wife has heard of the service of the Goatören Municipality."
We called the city, they came right away.
He said, "I'm already paralyzed from the neck down, so at least I'm not neglecting my dental care because of this service."
"My mother has been addicted to bed for 7.5 years due to old age," said Kezban Gökçe, 72, daughter of a 95-year-old Gülizar Taşçıoğlu living in Pınarbaşı neighborhood.
When I came to town hall, I saw posters of this service, and I called right away.
We have been receiving this service regularly for four years.
I have a problem with my teeth, too, and when the doctors come, they look at me.
He used the phrases, "We're very pleased."
There is no need for health care for services that are completely free of charge.
"Stem" incident in Turkish military
My dear readers, very interesting decisions have been made especially for the Marine Corps at the High Military Shura (YARR) meeting the other day.
He was appointed to command this Force, not a admiral, but a admiral.
It's an almost unprecedented procedure in our army.
So how did this happen?
Force Commander Or Admiral Bülent Bostanoglu had already served his time, he was going to retire...
And it happened.
Now it was time for Veysel Kösele, the only admiral.
Veysel Pasha, who was a victim of conspiracy in the past and was imprisoned for a while, was supposed to be commander in the normal ranking.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm just trying to make it very brief that if we start at the top of the Marine Corps, no commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 have been promoted.
In that case, the Admiralship was the only one left in the Navy.
He was supposed to be brought to the vacant office, number two, Navy Commander Oral Admiral Veysel Kösele.
And then what happened?
In sixth place, Vice Admiral Adnan Ozbal was appointed by the government.
Now look at this painting!
Admiral Veysel Kösele is standing there, but instead, a lower-ranking commander is appointed!
A senior is being put under the command of the junior.
I wonder what happens next.
A senior admiral does not serve or do not serve under a senior lieutenant general.
He doesn't take orders from her, he doesn't.
In this case, Veysel Kösele will not endure this hurtful situation, and if he is not retired, he will resign today or tomorrow.
That's the hurtful message given to him by the government: "Goodbye Veysel Pasha!"
Yesterday afternoon, when I wrote this article, word had spread that he had resigned, but the situation had not yet been officially announced.
Let's look at this again!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele for one reason or another, forced him to resign, forced him to replace him with a 6th-ranked coramiral and undermined our army's traditional sense of "age."
There's got to be politics involved, but we don't know the behind-the-scenes.
Maybe if someone tells us soon, we'll find out together!
My dear readers, I've tried to explain very briefly, especially in the Turkish army, the seniority issue is very important.
Not just as a rank.
For example, the officer who finished the military academy in the 10th row is more senior than the one who finished in the 11th.
He's senior to the general rank, senior to the second rank.
We've lived in the Istiklal Harbin for concrete examples of this seniority.
Ismet Pasha, commander of the Garp Front...
You have two armies at your disposal.
Army and 2nd Army.
It's 1922, our armies will launch a major offensive and fire the Greek army.
At this stage, there are valuable names expected to be appointed military commander.
One is Refet Pasha.
He's being offered military command, but he says, "I'm a junior, I can't take his orders."
Another name is Jacob Sevki (Subasi) Pasha.
Atatürk's instructor at the Military Academy...
He's a valuable and senior commander who's been involved in various wars, who he loves, who he values, who he calls "teacher."
In 1919, he was captured along with military and civilian Turkish intellectuals and sent to Malta by the British.
On his return home, he is reluctant and says the same thing about military command: "The commander of the Western Front is inferior to me, I can't take orders from him".
But Ataturk has persuaded him to be grateful, and Jacob Sevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
Third, it's a very colorful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A soldier who talks too much, who always criticizes.
A commander who fought in Iraq, Caucasian, Iran, and various fronts.
He's also being exiled by the British to Malta, where he flees to Ankara via Kuşadasi.
When he is offered military command, Ali İhsan Pasha says the same thing: "I can't fight under Ismet, who is my junior."
But he's being persuaded...
But you see, once he's in office, he's always arguing with the commander of the Garp Front, Ismet Pasha, who's been at his disposal, making a scene and making the army uncomfortable...
And shortly before the great assault, he was sacked and retired, instead of the bearded Nurettin Pasha.
Then Ali Ihsan Pasha's relationship with Atatürk never improves.
The issue of seniority in the Turkish military comes not only in war but also in peace.
Of course he has to come out.
Veysel Palace is the last example of this.
How did an activist have to learn the answer to the question, "Who owns the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
The day after he came to New York City for a tour, the native of St. Louis sat in the bed of Airbnb, where he rented it, and he started walking around on Facebook on his phone.
It came from a high school split.
"Police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street."
He was surprised that no one else shared this information in the content stream, so he turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A user called @TheePharoah is constantly tweeted in his content stream.
A rapper from St. Louis County was tweeting Michael Brown's death alive, murdered by an unarmed black police officer in Ferguson Missouri, 18 years old.
He posted a picture of Brown's body on the street, which was gonna be there for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is brutal."
But death was nothing new to him or his people.
He left his phone for tweets about people gathering at Canfield Drive later that night.
There were photos of police tapes, screaming people, and a man holding a banner that said, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another cop, he said, set the trigger on his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembered saying, 'This is unusual.'
"'This isn't the typical and typical murder we're used to.'
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After getting off at 11:00 a.m., he picked up his 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go with her to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to ferrell and ferguson the next three years will arrive at the cinema on August 11th, a new documentary entitled "who owns the streets?"
It's a story about survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance, people living in that community, filling the streets with answers they're looking for.
While Ferrell was driving his vehicle to Ferguson with his daughter in a flowered dress and wearing a proper crown, they returned that morning to talk about "the experiences of black people and the circumstances of black people," which they had done many times before.
Remember when I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe?
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that wasn't true.
I couldn't not take it," Ferrell said later.
"What happened here today... is a consequence of what happened in the past.
He needs to know, he needs to see, and he needs to grow up in it.
Not only does it have to develop in the field of activism and organizing, but it also has to know the layers of its black experience and its black state and what we have to do to free ourselves.
If I'm lucky enough to give him an experience that he can't personally experience rude racism, he'll be no different than any black woman-child.
I feel like I'm doing him a bad thing by protecting him from them."
When they got to Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, where they were waiting to talk to Officer Darren Wilson about the fact that there was no crime later.
There he contacted Ferrell and his daughter's local business owners who prepared packed food.
They packed bags and helped get them to the protesters.
Gradually, for Ferrell, a new form of action was being formed.
When I was a student at the State University of Missouri, she found that she was head of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on injustice in food and health in the black community, and said, "My action has completely changed since August 9th."
"I didn't have any experience with orchestrating.
It came on its own."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with one of the co-directors of the film, Sabaah Foyan, at an evening screening.
Foyan said he and his own cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "wanted to explain" what was going on.
Ferrell came up with a question: "Do you want to document it or do you want to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism was reported by countless people, often whites, to come to a society and profit from its pain and resistance.
As Foyan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of the people who were born and raised in Ferguson couldn't concentrate, and we decided to do it in a different way."
Foyan had already contacted regional co-director Damon Davis, known for his activism regarding convicted felons.
His participation warmed Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals, as well as the "Who's The Streets?" team watched it during the years after Brown was shot.
David said, "This documentary isn't about someone talking for us or talking to us, it's about us."
"That's the main thing for me, how to represent these people because that's how I'm supposed to be represented."
"The goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, but to show that the move is not "about a leader, it's about society coming together," he said, proving that the movie participants are the most open.
As a result, "Whose Streets?", surprisingly, documentes the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughing at his first vision of the finished product.
"But while I was doing this and humanizing black people, I knew there might be some sensitivity."
And Ferrell's story reinforces the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement and puts them back in the center.
Two of the three founders of the movement who developed the slogan #BlackLivesMatter after the murder of black young Trayvon Martin in 2012 define themselves as homosexuals.
"Black gay women in the leadership have generally kept the movement going," Ferrell said, "and this is because we are constantly at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to carry all the weight of it."
"The movement is really being held by black women and a lot of gay black women," he added.
Nevertheless, Ferrell insists that "there is nothing in the form of an act that is advocating," and that he was not chosen because of his identity.
It says, "He was the one who triggered this energy."
"But it's no coincidence that she's on the front lines, because as a black gay woman, there's so much you can lose by living a life in these intersections.
You can feel its energy on the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras are long gone in Ferguson, but the alarming racial connections between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is under surveillance for another two and a half years for shutting down the highway during a demonstration.
My home describes the socio-political atmosphere in what it calls a total chaos.
Still, Ferguson keeps track of the song he carved into his memory three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our job to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round, it's flat!
Irving speaking to NBC Sports, "The world is not round."
The world is flat.
They get used to these things by giving people fear.
Oh, man, don't ask too much.
Because the more information you solve, the more information comes out.
This is crazy.
Is the world straight?
Or does it circle around in a circle?
I think you should look into it.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our faces.
They're lying to us!
Irving, "I believed for years that I wanted to believe."
I thought the world was round and round.
Do you really think we're going back inside the solar system?
Nothing they send back.
He's not coming back!
The information they're giving us is very inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for that fact.
He said, "Do you understand what I'm saying?"
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, is competing with the Cleveland Cavaliers for 24.4 points and 5.9 assist averages this season.
A fitting likeness: the artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, there are many faces of white, black and brown, each of which is almost vaguely similar, hanging over the wires on the ceiling.
These 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, ear sticks and cut hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
As it is known, after leaking classified diplomatic messages through WikiLeaks website, former intelligence analyst Manning, who served 35 years in prison, sent his hair cut from Fort Leavenworth.
The new exhibition opened on August 2nd is called a proper likeness.
This is a product of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagborg, who combined his discipline with his expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a trans-woman and a leading dissident, who was pardoned by Barack Obama for three days of his term.
Dewey-Hagborg, who created 30 portraits using an algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA, using what a person with this gene data might look like, revealed his identity with a firm, maybe some mental interpretation, not just the fact that DNA data has many ways to be processed, and not the determinism from the core of the comments.
Manning, born Bradley Edward but who clearly described himself as a woman in his teens, was convicted of 20 counts in 2013, including six counts of espionage, computer fraud and theft.
His image was oppressed by the prison, so there was only one picture of Manning, who was clearly agitated, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-yellow wig, a sandy black and white selfie.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg's 2012 project was successful with the huge splash of stranger hunches.
In this, the artist made portraits of the remains of cigarette butts and pieces of forensic gum to draw a picture of what these people might look like.
That's when he got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"When Chelsea Manning was in prison, they were doing an interview, and they wanted some kind of portrait that could accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press preview of the new exhibition.
Meanwhile, he couldn't visit, he couldn't take a picture, so they reached Chelsea and asked if he was interested in getting a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration have exchanged many letters over the past two years to become unexpected pen pals.
They even uncovered a comic book, a comic book by Shoili Lawgo, where the president pardons Chelsea's punishment and imagines a future where she can personally see the exhibition.
It was a kind of happy coincidence that Obama actually asked Manning's release a few days after the book was released, after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump is finding new, tweetable ways to wage war on government leakers and transsexual soldiers to further fuel the sharp divisions that he is asked to repair, there is something deep and powerful about this exhibition that is now being opened.
When asked about the strange timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "The events happen for a reason."
An artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, which is beneath Manning's huge signature (the point of the "i" in his family name, "sexuality, race, sexuality and culture", was calling for an end to "automatic discrimination".
There's his mitochondrial DNA sequence across the wall: a lot of C's, G's and A's written in pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophistical science dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to tell us how amazingly similar we all are, at least as biological creation.
"What I hope people will find out from this is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open the genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, who was on display in 2007.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, and that's 30 of them."
The last piece in an exhibition held in a single room is a page from the previously mentioned short comic book.
Here's Manning, King Kong style, coming out of the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a loudspeaker.
It says, "When they shut you up, they win."
"Don't ever shut up because of it."
The artist from Philadelphia said, "This came directly from a letter he wrote to me."
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has yet to see the exhibition personally (as it is quite predictable from the comic book) but when he sees it, he will be greeted by masks with his own genetic impressions, which are collected in the middle of the room like a group of protestors.
Like everything else in the exhibition, the genetic haploupes were made especially from Manning's height (5"2, Manning's height), which was written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg said about portraits, "I would have put them on the wall in the past, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd."
"I wanted this to be perceived as a mass movement shaped by Chelsea, which is the same as the movement behind her liberation."
Northwestern instructor and Oxford University employee Wanted for Murder
Police say a nationwide manhunt has been launched for a Northwestern University instructor and Oxford University employee, who was wanted as suspects after being found stabbed to death in a high-end apartment in Chicago.
Cook County records show that on Monday, the arrest warrants were released for first-degree murder for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for alleged involvement in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Documents say Cornell-Duranleau (26) died several times after being stabbed.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27th.
Officers received a phone call, reached Grand Plaza Appartments, and found the victim with multiple lacerations.
Official sources say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and the police are actively searching for two suspects, investigating the stabbing as a homicide.
Lathem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail that Lathem was on administrative leave and that he was banned from campuses at Northwestern University.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," he said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
"We are in contact with the United Kingdom police and are ready to help US investigative authorities in any way they need," an envoy from the university and Somerville University said in an e-mail.
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were in shock and that they wanted him to surrender.
Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi of the Chicago Police Department said he strongly encouraged suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to identify them are concentrated," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who had just received a mysterious tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the crime scene as terrifying.
Guglielmi also said it was unclear whether it was July 27th.
He said that Lathem and Warren were in the building, confirmed by security cameras.
"We believe that the victim was having an affair with student member Latham," Guglielmi said.
"Police are still working on the victim's timeline and background and investigating a series of stories, possibly a domestic incident," the management staff at Grand Plaza told residents.
Italy seized the German ship
Italian police have announced that the ship, Iuventa, which is in search and rescue of asylum seekers in the Middle Mediterranean, was seized yesterday at Lampedusa Island.
The police, who also shared with reporters the phone conversations he claimed belonged to two members of the organisation, announced that this operation was conducted as part of an investigation launched by the Trapani Prosecutor’s Office in October 2016.
The Jugend Rettet members, who allegedly operated in favour of "illegal immigration" on the Libyan-Italy line, are allegedly bringing refugees directly from Libyan human traffickers' boats to Italy at least three times.
Jugend Rettet, questioned by the prosecution, has also committed this crime with some members of the Libyan Coast Guard.
Following this, the organisation said they were assessing the charges against them, indicating that their priorities would continue to save human lives.
In addition to the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, there are about nine international NGOs involved in the search and rescue of asylum seekers in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government issued a 13-point code of conduct for these organisations to comply and stipulated that it be signed.
Breaking news: 5 of Banlı's buffets that attacked the Greaterkan have been sealed
Following the attack on Eskişehir Metropolitan Mayor Yılmaz Büyükşen, police detained him and sealed five buffets of retired police officer Mahfuz Banlı, who was arrested by the court they were brought into, rented from TCDDD, were sealed by Küpebaşı Municipality.
According to Habertürk, a large number of police and riot squads accompanied municipal teams.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "In the short term, we will complete the WADA road map"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the return of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSDA).
"A certain phase in meeting road map criteria has been completed, Rushada has earned the right to plan and test in co-operation with the UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA road map was updated in this context," Mutko said Thursday.
He was considering the second part of the WADA Regulatory Adjustment Road Map, which recently outlined the criteria on the agency's website, describing the resuscitation of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, it doesn't involve anything that concerns Russia.
"Everything is announced, all will be carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned on the list states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the reported state-sponsored doping investigation in the Russian sport, claimed by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, approved by WADA.
"Our anti-doping system accepts a failure, while we conduct the investigation.
All measures have been carried out.
But there is no government programme, and we will not accept anything that does not exist."
Mutko's words echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to the Russian broadcaster RSport earlier today, Smirnov acknowledged past problems in Russian anti-doping organs, but added: "We have said at many opportunities that the report contains positions and regulations that create contrast.
No one is considering the report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended by WADA after the doping scandal in November 2005, in Russia.
However, under the supervision of international experts and the United Kingdom Anti-Doping (UKAD), this June test planning and coordination were allowed.
In July, after a visit to the agency's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli announced that Rushada was "going in the right direction" to get back online.
100 million people watched!
The video, entitled "Come to Besiktas", which Beşiktaş announced his transfer to Negredo, soon reached 100 million people from 18 countries.
The video, decorated with the dialogues of Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo, was also shared from the websites of major newspapers such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
The President of Galatasaray does not return empty-handed
Galatasaray former president Faruk Szen sharply criticised Dursun Uzbek, who went to Bucharest and the capital Ankara for transfer to Ndiaye to convince Mircea Lucescu.
Here's a special statement from the legendary president for SABAH readers:
Lucescu-Uzbek interview: "We were finishing up when we left."
The President of Galatasaray doesn't go for nothing, and he doesn't come back empty-handed.
Ndiaye transfer: The President of Galatasaray does not go to the football player.
The football player comes to the president.
Of course they do, whether he kisses her hand or hugs her...
But whoever the player is, the president won't go for him.
You're giving 9 million euros to the player that Ottomanspor got for 300,000 Euros...
It's not 7.5 million, it's 9 million in bonuses!
You've already made a big investment, of course you will, and it'll be 7.5... 9...
Uzbek's actions: I don't want to criticize.
But it's obvious.
G.Saray readings are erosion.
It's not just football, it's all wrong to approach them.
The Council and the General Assembly will change that.
But from what I understand, the members are pleased!
Start-ups to help your company not become the next Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to measure her employee happiness at e-commerce start-up, but the polls weren't working.
The answers were usually vague, unhelpful, or worse, deceptive.
Even though he pledged anonymity, some of the employees didn't trust the process.
Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company in San Francisco on hair care, says, "He has never had consistency or objectivity."
So he called for help from the outside.
A new kind of human resources start-up to help companies understand how their employees feel.
These allow companies to produce and licensing software, which is specifically designed to measure the busyness of employees, to conduct quick-tracked surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer anonymous and complaint helplines to employees, and in some cases bypass the top executives, and allow employees to go to the board and announce an indiscreetness.
"Now there are vehicles following your health, such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company's Fitbit?" said Jim Barnett, the founding partner and president of the Redwood City startup, who measured the busy work by software analysis tools.
Errett says his employees use Glint to understand better what he thinks and feels after three years.
In addition to presenting quick surveys and options to specific teams, it offers a heat map, which shows which parts of the company receive the most complaints and which director has low ratings, so that they can be tampered with.
To avoid becoming the next Uber, companies are beginning to understand that businesses need to know about their culture; Uber has been in a scandal ever since describing an environment of harassment in which people who clearly say what they think in a blog published by an ex-employee.
For start-ups like Glint, this request for surveillance means a very profitable business opportunity.
According to the financial technology insight website Let's Talk Payments, the global management, regulation and compatibility industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
The interest and activity of Denver-based start-up Convercent, which has helped companies detect and block bad behavior, has increased in the debates of Uber's disrepute earlier this year.
Convercent has close to 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct personalized "pulse" inspections, collect secret answers in real time, and map out the heat of troubled areas.
It also provides an anonymous helpline for employees to report bad behavior.
If the president is charged, the complaints go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Covercent, said that "the public court court has taken the regulators".
Quinlan said: If a company treats its employees badly or does not treat its employees ethically, even if the regulators don't step in, consumer boycotts, employee casualties or lawsuits may face costly consequences.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 positions, has been using Convercent for over a year to inform his employees of the principles and procedures and offer them a way to reach the company's headquarters easily.
Before, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or an e-mail from the company headquarters, making an official complaint and hoping it would be taken seriously.
Ruby Tuesday's chief legal counsel, James Vitrano, said that these are often intimidating and disturbing experiences, not a good way to pursue employee complaints.
However, with the company's use of Convercent, problems that have been hidden from executives who used to live in offices, cities, or state distances (such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practice) can now be identified and solved.
"I can get closer to this work experience from a holistic 360 degree perspective," said Vitrano, who led Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"Also, we protect our shareholders against business cases."
After Arthur Andersen's collapse in 2002 in violation of ethics due to the Enron scandal, companies took matters of ethics, values and relationships with the employee more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after "social media" came to its senses, firms realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from getting viral.
"Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
They offer both Glint and Convercent software as a service and receive repeated fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who support both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and raised its total capital to $47 million.
Glint made $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the nature, culture, and risk capital of companies that are connected.
Increasing amounts of research indicate that today's employees expect more from their workplace than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just minimum requirements.
The employees want to feel accepted, valued, and given their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices are heard and their work is satisfied, they are more sincere to make that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of LinkedIn, who uses both Convecent and Glint.
Investors make a profit when their portfolio companies do good work; companies do good work when their employees are sincere and feel they belong to the company.
It's not surprising if the third party analysis tools promise to boost the employees' sincerity and feelings of belonging.
Data on employee commitment is important to business culture experts.
But the data is useless if the company's people don't act.
In fact, if a company wants feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that change is coming.
And if expectations don't come fast enough or never come, they can be disappointing and make the employees feel like they're cut off.
"If you want 4,000 proposals, you need to be ready to talk about 4,000," Russell Raath, who is head of advisory at Kotter International and sees companies making the mistake of making too much trust in data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, the staff will think, 'Do you really hear me?
What do you care?
And why should I care if you don't care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly employee surveys, was able to act on the same day when a problem was reported in Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were tired of the speed of decision-making and communication quality, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and add communication training to solve problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights into its own employees, and in the long run, it hopes that it will become more able to hire workers in an industry known to have a high number of employees coming in and out.
"If you are not dependent on creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrona said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose companies."
It's a long day for Bruins to have the NCAA take two practice days off.
It's 11:00 a.m., and a mob of UCLA football players hang out on one side of the team's new training field on campus.
Some strip off their jerseys, revealing their sweaty backs from the sweat of the first day of training camp.
For a significant part of the team, these free minutes form a mid-day break.
After three hours of training, the summer-class players will return to their dorms and study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the 6:30 next morning.
Just before Bruins coach Jim Mora returned to Tuesday, he said, "The next three days are an ordeal for these men."
The NCAA, which is designed to lift the burden on the players, removes two practices a day, at least until the finals are over on Friday, has actually extended their days.
That's why UCLA's first three training practices are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m., which is already in the tight schedule of the players.
The reward for not having two practices a day is more every day; Bruins is moving the camp's start up a week from last season, and during summer school, Mora is training for the first time in summer school in Westwood for the first time in six seasons.
In September, they plan to practice 18 exercises for their openings against the Texas A&M, before they start preparing for the formal match.
Mora said the NCAA supports the change of rules, even though the players added new pens to the intensive work programme.
Mora said, "We're putting a huge burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging."
"And they've been through it recently; they're working, they're great kids.
I think we'll have more time when we get to Saturday, it's gonna be really great."
UCLA will stop training when the camp is over; it is no easy task, given that the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which is hit by a rain of footballs next door and closes the back of the castle with a protective net, is lying in the field line of sight.
The Bruins players are scheduled to move into the hotel starting this week, but Mora admits that during the season, these rooms could be a problem.
"We'll have security," Mora said.
"It's a real worry, and it's not too crazy to think that someone's gonna rent a room and sit there and videotape a practice.
If there's a videotape of a practice, that's a pretty good thing.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security up there at parking lot 8.
We'll do our best with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry about it too much.
We have a plan."
Facebook boosts story authentication to fight against fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to the third party story authenticators and show their findings under original sharing; this is how it described its efforts to combat the world's largest online social network on Thursday as false news.
In a statement on the company website, the company said they would use updated machine learning to identify possible frauds and send them to story authenticators, which would potentially show the story confirmation results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised as being one of the main distribution points of news, which many believe has affected the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political headline in Europe, when French voters hit a false news flood before the presidential election in May, and Germany supports the plan to cut fines if they fail to quickly remove hate-filled shares to social media networks there before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate German statement that a test of the new story confirmation is being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what stories are discussed by the third party story verifiers, people want more resources on what they read and share to make decisions based on information," Facebook news stream manager Sara Su said on a blog.
Facebook will continue to test its "interested article" feature and will work on other changes in the news stream to reduce false news, he added.
Creating comic books is the story of a Castle in England.
In his recent past, the tiny castle Scotney appeared in a Squeeze music video and became a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But right now, Scotney, who inspired a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire, who had broom hair and a passion for historical documents, witnessed 700 years of turbulent history in Kent from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley.
"I find it very nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years."
"What a personal bond it is to hold this letter in my hand."
In England, from the Edward era to the Middle Ages, each story is documented by a different artist (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he also wrote Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories in 2014, an unexpectedly emotional project inspired by stories from the British Library.
"I even tear up the fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for King James fans," he says.
"That was his thumbprint!
And the letters always smell like work because you used to light a fire for the light.
For someone in the future for 300 years, that smell feels like it's there, too.
Oh, I love archives!"
As a man in love with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the British Council of Arts and being able to stay in a castle for almost four months (to be honest, I've gone a little too far over my welcome.)
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" fortress, scanning the archives, and studying many treasures and antiques, such as hyena heads and bottles that spent centuries in ditches, mounted on the walls of the manor.
By talking to rangers, gardeners, and sometimes artists who worked on the illustrations of his book, he traveled the lands and ruins of the old castle.
And then at night, he'd drink whiskey and start writing.
Since National Trust only had access to full access when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006, Scotney's detailed history is relative.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff only began to take over the archive, which he described as saying, "A hundred years old aristocrats were saying, "Oh, throw it in the attic."
The journals, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that define the limits of who has what: "You think the land conflicts will be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch tree on which two families fought.
Forget it, men!"
Some of the stories in the collection, including The Laborer, who left the newly built castle to join the Peasant Rebellion in 1381, use the castle as a stepping point to make a wider entrance into British history.
"In this book, Knight Families of Kent and Sussex, there is a record of a riot in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The Village Rebellion started around here, and I thought a riot might be a good starting point.
Maybe these two are connected?"
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, who told the story of the Darrell family, who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during British Islam.
Or "The Smuggler", a 18th-century smuggler named Arthut Darrell, who was thought to have filled a coffin with stones and staged his own funeral.
The Darrells were Rhodes' favorite scottney family: "These guys looked like a bunch of crooks, they always went into debt and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, the Darrell men solved debt crises by marrying rich old women; I imagine them to be a group of handsome men capable of courting female heirs."
Rhodes, whose mission at the castle is over, is searching for more singular writing experiences.
In Finnish wildlife, Fin completed a two-week job for a comic book on Elämänmäki, a field of a sanatorium in the early 20th century, which has since been repossessed by nature.
But Scotney has a place in his heart.
He says, "I'm sorry I left."
"It's like: 'Oh, now I have to go and face his fucking real life.'"
'Maho' reaction to Meral Akshener
Nationalist Movement Party Secretary İsmet Grandataman has made a written statement regarding allegations of resignation in social media and media recently related to the MHP.
Using social media and "some of the old rifle Marxists" to the MHP, he said, "The vote and counters were applied to prevent the international movement from continuing under the MHP roof after September 12th".
Grandadman said:
"He rubs his hands with how many records, criminal cases, clouded ideas, confused, unable to digest the Turkish nation's historical existence, who can't accept the Turkish nation's homeland."
"Now they have resigned in Yenişehir district of MHP Kocaeli Gölcük district organization administration and members of MHP Bursa district of Yenişehir district".
Public opinion has been misled by unfounded reports such as 250 resignations, 300 resignations.
In newspaper columns, lies have become huge, deception deepened.
We don't have a resignation in this issue, but we don't have the number of clients in the talk.
The Grandataman, who described the resignations as "so-called", said the polls he also referred to as "so-called" have tried to misdirect the public and misdirect the perception management.
"Their propaganda and campaigns towards creating perception against the MHP will backfire," he said.
MHP is an important and indispensable actor in Turkish politics, MHP Secretary General Grandataman said about the resignations.
The old Marxists can't afford to destroy the place the MHP acquired in the Turkish nation's conscience.
All comments are based on a dirty account behind the methods of perception management.
Because politics and media are staring at the base of the MHP.
It doesn't make any sense to us that those who don't work or work hard for our party while they're amongst us are now resigning.
What's wrong with those who can't take advantage of our party for their own good?
The people who have never done MHP any good in their lives, who have not shared our memories, who have not understood our ideals, who have not participated in our struggle, who have always stood on the sidelines, whose mind has been charred, whose heart has been stoned, must find other distractions for themselves.
The efforts of those who cannot pull the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party are futile efforts to stir up sedition, debate and disunity.
And he'll turn around and shoot the owner.
The Nationalist Movement is the last standing fortress of the Turkish nation, despite heavy destruction.
"The Nationalist Movement is not unclaimed," he said in his statement, calling the "political counterfeiters", "political snatchers" for those he claims to be targeting the MHP.
"The outer altars, which feed from beyond the ocean, will not achieve their goals at any cost," he said.
Using the statement, "Tasted traitors will go mad and burn in a fire," MHP Grandataman said in his statement, listing opposition parties and terrorist organizations, making claims: "From CHP to HDP; from there to Perinçels, from PKK to FETÖ, no one will be able to operate on the Turkish nation's right to claim its own destiny."
Yesterday, we resisted the new tactics and games of non-Turşe" MHP, non-MHP planners; we fought to the end with the bastards who wanted MHP, the MHP, the parliament without MHP.
Now we're gonna break the game, we're gonna ruin the players.
"The patent of country is in MHP," he said, referring to Meral Akshener as saying: "It is obvious that Maho will take the villagers to Germany, as in the old film Banker Bilo, which was made in ancient Green Ages, as he said for days in a truck box, and then leave you on a mountainside in Istanbul, the resignations they followed will say, "It is clear that they will leave you on the edge of the cliff," he said.
It's their business, but all we want from these clients is for them to be new to where they're going.
Kjaer signed Sevilla
Kjaer, who was transferred to Seville for 12.5m euros from the Sari-Lacivert team, signed the official contract, which was the most expensive defence transfer of the Spanish team.
The Danish star will be wearing number four in Seville.
It's a lot easier than THY for parents with babies.
According to the THY Press Advisory, the national airline, which puts forward the comfort and satisfaction of its passengers and continues to develop new ideas for an excellent travel experience, which is working to make them feel more comfortable during the flight.
In this direction, the "baby travel kit", designed to study the needs of babies between the ages of 0 and 2 and their families, began to be presented to baby passengers traveling between continents starting in August.
The kit, designed with a custom-designed kit, includes a diaper, a disposable apron, diaper cream, baby lotion and shampoo, newborn wet cotton wipes and chest pads.
Paraben, alcohol, products that do not include paint and harmful chemicals were produced based on the sensitivity of the baby’s skin.
Washington Changes Green Card Rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump said there would be a new US immigration plan changing Green Card rules.
It envisions reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
New rules were proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both parts of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase salaries and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States gives Green Card to other citizens of the country.
The law will reduce the migration of chains and replace the current regime.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates, able financial resources and those with the skills to benefit our economy," the American media quoted Trump as saying.
Authors comment on Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
For two seasons, Kadıköy had regained the joy and glory I could not find, the glory I could not see...
Aykut Big's team of "middle-hearted" in the dust was on the field to make a "stand behind us" deal with his supporters.
We can criticize your game, positions or performances, but I haven't seen a game that works like this in a long time.
He made his mark in the first game, but yesterday he put his epaulets on his shoulder, and now Valbuena is the commander of Fenerbahçe in the field.
His age was a problem when he was transferred, but in Big's words, there was the phrase "insurmountable character."
30 years ago, we gave the name of the atom ant to Reza Çimmbay.
If he manages, it'll be the most appropriate comment for the French player.
He's been all over the field, joining all the rust organizations, always taking responsibility and scoring a goal, putting on a big, big show.
Alper's lead, his second striker position, left Sturm Graz in his field "short" for a long time.
When Fenerbahçe closed the circuit before the corner, he searched for a formula to break through such a hard wall.
They control the ball, but they can't make effective passes in the opponent's penalty field.
This image may be a "need a centrphore" comment, but we're dealing with a game that hesitates to pass to Ahmethan, which can't put the only centrfor in position.
Either the team didn't trust the young player, or his performance needs to be improved.
They didn't get two clear opportunities after the score was 1-1.
It was important for them to pass the tour, but it would make the night even better to stand up to this fan, "Gol", who cheered for the players' struggle.
We'll probably have another one or two transfers by Monday.
But the truth is, Fenerbahçe needs number 12...
We're on the verge of a very bright and joyous season with the heart of those in the stands who are trying to play in the front.
Aykut Big's machine is installing its beam, it needs more time.
They're in good physical condition.
The game quality will also improve.
And you can see clearly that all the football players in the field are getting more confident.
They really need the applause from last night for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried.
Just when you think 2017 can't get any weirder, a new report on technological advances in the sex robot industry comes in.
Yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Association (FRRRR) published a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and founder of the FRR, we need to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color, nipple shape and nail type of the robot.
"People are laughing at them, but the firms are actually moving a lot, and we're going to see them even more."
Modern sex babies evolved into robots with human responses, especially by artificial intelligence, with silicon skin, which is hot to touch from inflated similars.
Users can also personalize their robots by choosing everything from the eye color to the nipple shape and nail type or color of the robot to match their own blood.
But with so many robots so innovative as to make a Stepford Woman look like a Stepford Woman, it gets even more disturbing.
Modern sex babies evolved into silicone-skin robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to personalize their own robots based on character characteristics (such as shyness) that they find attractive.
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, including "Frijit Farrah" and "Wild Wendy", who come in with pre-programmed personalities, who appear to be shy.
True Companion's website is raging: "Roxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as much as possible."
I mean, he loves what you love, what you don't love, and so on.
And they have moods like real people in the day.
He can be sleepy, he can be willing to talk, or he can be in full mode.
There are many disturbing aspects of the rise of sex robots, not just the replacement of real human relationships, but the highly obedient female personality traits, the rapeous associations as Frigid Farah approaches are the most thought-finding.
True Companion on the Web site compares Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator like this, why can't men have Roxxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, a withdrawal from the idea of gender equality, an optional addition to the desire to subjugate sex.
Many men naturally will not have sex robots, and even though the FRR has drawn attention to their growing popularity, they are now in the outer areas of consumer culture.
But leakers can be highly instructive about the course of our time.
Most people aren't weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
It's no coincidence that with a president who boasts about sexual assault on women in the White House, these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide.
The creepiest thing about The Handmaid's Tale TV show is not all the descriptions of the details, not the nooseed corpses or the carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn't feel like such a big change right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical similarities as possible with real women (of course, in the proportions of porn film stars) as possible.
Their creators want them to feel human when they touch them, and they want them to mimic the actions of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities", robots clearly do not represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
There's no activity, no past stories, nothing to compromise their independence or the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they're pleasurable slaves.
Or as they call it in 2017: concubines.
Assault on an American military convoy: dead and wounded...
The suicide attack in Karabağ, Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
It has been announced that 5 of the wounded were American soldiers in the convoy and 1 were translators with NATO forces, including 5 of the wounded in the explosion that killed 1 NATO soldiers and 3 civilians.
NATO reinforcements in Afghanistan (Resolute Support) said NATO forces had detonated a homemade explosive during a joint patrol mission with the Afghan National Army.
The injured personnel have been admitted to treatment at Bagram Airport, U.S. Military Hospital.
The wounded are in no danger of life.
Local media says the suicide bomber is Taliban.
Trump's great talent?
Make Mitt Romney look like a common sense figure.
The microscale division of the political division that polarized US voters was the reality of the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the newspapers in the United States were full of how to deal with the nightmare of relatives who voted for Trump.
We're all trying to blow up our so-called filtration bubbles.
Less talk about Trump's power to bring families together.
I'm referring to this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has a falling-out relationship with the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
It reminded me that a merger against a common enemy can have a powerful impact.
With Trump in the White House, everyone he's known, including his Republican brother, whom he's been arguing about for decades, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
At the dinner table, of course, that's a good thing, but it seems to me that in a broad context, this is a significant risk.
Sol was played by Trump, but the bending effect of his presidency created the power to push to the right for all time.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the terrible possibility that one day his strange behavior may no longer be shocking.
In fact, there's a much more terrifying long-term scenario where Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who oppose their own standards, and all of a sudden, they seem to be a symbol of logic.
I find myself experiencing nostalgia for the bizarre version of Mitt Romney's madness these days: the dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax returns looked like), both of which are very light crimes according to Trump.
When Trump's gone, he just needs to be sane to assess the fact that the next Republican candidate is making unmeasurable progress.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the merry-go-round in Central Park, the biggest carousel ever run by the New York Parks Department, and if you don't need caffeine, it's the best three bucks you can spend in the city.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder (all making strange faces, clowns and animals looking behind their shoulders in fear) and the music that rattles is extremely exciting.
In other words, many of the clichés of a city can be disappointing: the view of high buildings gets boring, the horizon gets too familiar to create much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't reach the dream.
It's been 35 years, and I still haven't completely overcome the day I discovered that the Swiss Cottage was a big roundabout in North London, not actually a Swiss country house.
However, the merry-go-round in Central Park is still a strangely magical experience, so that two people at two, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go there and have a very good time.
If I could grade the merry-go-round, I would give him a full grade, but, thankfully, no one asked.
On the other hand, before passing my credit card this week, I was asked to evaluate the process between 1 and 5 stars.
It's the same thing at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and the option to match the note to a 15% tip for what was bought at the counter.
The effect of this is not only that it slows down what should be an objective exchange, but that it puts pressure on the server to create a personality that is not needed at all.
I gave him five stars in my experience of giving him credit cards while the poor woman at the jackpot was standing there smiling like she was apologizing.
They're wearing bathing suits after the temperature's past 41 degrees.
In Tunceli, one of the hottest days of the season, the people flocked to Munzur beaches.
As early as noon, the heat was getting heavy, young, young, old, women, and men, who entered the beaches on the banks of Munzur Tea, tried to avoid the heat by cooling off in freezing waters.
The beaches on the banks of Munzur Tea were flooded, especially because Tunceli citizens living in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and England spent their holidays at home instead of the Aegean or the Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, one of the coolers on Munzur Beach, said she was using her choice for the holiday instead of the western provinces, saying, "I didn't want to spend my vacation in the west, so it was better to cool off in Munzur as a family, to stay on our own land."
"Munzur's freezing water is nowhere in the world, Munzur cools us down at these temperatures."
Hasan Yülu, who came from Germany, said they preferred the Munzur Tea coast in Tunceli instead of the Fountain or the Bodrum beaches and that they did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital with chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital to treat the lacerations on his wrists, which he said occurred after he fell in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors to the previous accidental murder order.
Early on Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Steenkamp several times at his home in Pretoria, a bathroom stall door.
Pistorius claimed that he had mistaken his girlfriend for someone who broke into the cabin at night.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal once again against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, who they think is too light.
The National Prosecution said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be assessed this year.
Pistorius, if the prosecutors succeed, will face a 15 year sentence.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
The first pilgrimage caravan has been sent away.
The pilgrim candidates who were going to Saudi Arabia with the chairmanship of Religious Affairs were sent away with prayers and tears at Atatürk Airport's Outer Lines Terminal.
Citizens and relatives attended the ceremony in the Outer Lines Terminal prior to the move of the first pilgrimage, as well as about 200 pilgrim candidates.
Turkish Airlines (THY), meanwhile, handed out roses to pilgrim candidates who flew on a scheduled plane to the sacred land.
The Hajj caravan in Ankara has been dismissed from Esanboğa.
The caravan also included martyrs and veterans who took advantage of this year's first practice of the "free pilgrimage for gas and martyrs".
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Camping
According to the State Department's statement and BTV quoted two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on the grounds of illegal camping.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia on the morning of August 1st.
They were released on the same day while the investigation was ongoing.
The foreign ministry reported to BTV that Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened their control of camping for free, and they are still inflicting serious punishments on those caught resting in undepended places.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court could issue a fine.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOE Hoffman (22) traveled with two friends to Turkey in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who drove the rental car to Adana and Mersin, disappeared in Silifke on July 8th.
Her friends, who she came with, despite all the calls, couldn't reach Hoffman, called her parents in Holland.
While police were on the move to find the missing tourist, he went to Jaimy Gewald Adana with his brother Robin Hoffman and friends Angelo Durei.
THE LANDS HAVE BEEN DISTURBED
Robin Hoffman, who applied to the police here, filed missing persons reports for her brother's whereabouts and distributed them in Adana and Mersin.
The last time they heard from Robin Hoffman's brother was on July 8th, and he said, "We went to the police first in Holland."
Later, two of my friends and I came to Turkey and applied to the police here.
So far, we haven't heard anything, and we haven't found a clue.
"We will stay in Turkey until news is found, until my brother is found," he said.
Second World, congratulations from the minister of Ayşe Ceren
At the 2017 Pallet Swimming Youth World Championship in Russia, the national athlete Ayşe Ceren Greenbaş was second in the world over 400 metres.
Youth and Sports Minister Osman Assim Bak congratulated silver medalist Ayşe Ceren Greenbaş with his message.
On the first day of the 2017 Pallet Swimming Youth World Championship in Russia, Ceren Greenhead was second in the world over 400 metres.
Ceren took his second place on the track with eight finalists, while missing the gold with only 27 saises.
At 400 metres, Elena Lopatina of Russia won the gold medal at 03.18.73 minutes, while Ceren won the silver medal at 03.19:00.
Turkey is represented by eight men and eight women at the championship.
His last words were, "I think I'm dying, goodbye, Mom."
Among those who have died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which has been reported to be 30 so far, is to call his mother at the time of the fire, "I don't want to die, Mom, it's not fair."
"Thank you for everything you've done for me, and it's been announced that Gloria Trevisan, the Italian who said goodbye, and her lover.
Among the tens who were not heard from after the fire were 26-year-old Gloria Trevisan, who lived on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building and her Italian lover Marco Gottardi.
Maria Cristina Sandri, lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, announced that both young people had died, according to British authorities.
The lawyer, who said young people's families were suffering a great deal, also asked reporters not to insist on getting an explanation.
I think I'm dying. Goodbye, Mom.
Attorney Sandri said Gloria called her mother Emanuela Trevisan on her cell phone shortly after the fire broke out, and she cried when she listened to these last conversations she recorded.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times during the two hours after the fire started around 1:00 local time.
"Mom, something bad is going on here, there's a fire."
We're stuck, we can't get out.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be rescued.
"We tried to open the door, but there was too much smoke and the elevator wasn't working."
As the fire grew, Gloria Trevisan's last words, which increased concern over her next search, were as follows:
Mom, my whole life is flashing before my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life ahead of me; it's not fair.
I don't want to die and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't hold you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me. Goodbye, Mom.
I'm going to heaven and I'm going to help you from there.
It's the Italian government's fault.
Gloria Trevisan, both of whom studied architecture, and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi moved to London in March, when he had a hard time finding work after graduating last year.
Gloria Trevisan, who was able to find a 300-euro salary job in her country, soon started working in London, with £800 a month (about 2060 euros).
Attorney Sandri said Gloria Trevisan's family had a hard time financially, "Gloria went to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young have to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government must find a solution to this problem immediately," he said.
Italy's drama that can't provide jobs for young people
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, expressed his anger, saying, "This is the fault of our government, which forced our young people to flee abroad to find work."
The unemployment rate in Italy reaches 12 per cent, while the youth rate exceeds 40 per cent.
After increasing this problem, many Italian youths have been emigrating to many European countries, especially Britain, for the past few years.
Only last year, the number of young people who had to leave Italy due to unemployment was over 110,000.
Comments in the Italian press on Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi's death confirmed that this was the drama of a country that could not provide jobs for its young people.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can make BiH light
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the opposite: a rich diet of meat - based proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable health condition that affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and excessive fatigue.
Although patients were often advised to skip meat and dairy to ease their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that protein's main aminoasis triptophas helped develop immune cells that developed a durable bowel.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol the bowels so that microbes hidden in the meal could not sneak into the body.
The cells that are capable of triggering the inflammation are stabilizing with cells that protect sensitive tissue without harm.
If the balance shifts too much towards infection, the inflammation can result from bowel disease.
Experiments found that there was a kind of immune cell that stimulated endurance in rats carrying a specific bacteria in their intestines.
And bacteria needs triptofana, which is one of the building blocks of protein, to trigger the release of cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have connected the development of the cell population, which promotes endurance with the type Lactobacillus reuterium, which is part of the intestine microbioma.'
Rats with more triptophans in their diet had more of these immune cells.'
If the same thing is happening to humans, L. suggested that a diet rich in reuteria and tripptophan could develop a more durable, less inflammatory bowel environment.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a post-doctrinal researcher, worked on some kind of immune cell that developed endurance, discovered that a group of lab rats had these cells, but not one group that was kept in a different place.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiomas of mice, bacteria, viruses, and fungal communities that normally live in the stomach-intestinal canal.
The rats' intestines were sequenced for DNA, and the rats with immune cells were found to have six types of bacteria, but they weren't.
Because they were looked at in a sterile environment, rats who lacked a bowel microbioma and did not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteria, and immune cells emerged.
In order to understand how bacteria affected the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in liquids, and then transferred it in small amounts of this liquid, which was bacteria-free to immature immune cells taken from mice.
The immune cells have become cells that promote endurance.
When the active component was purged from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of the triptophan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptophans in mice' foods, the number of cells increased by around 50 percent, but when their triptophan levels were cut in half, the number of cells fell in half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that humans have cells that encourage the same resilience as mice and that most of us have L. reuteria in their stomach-intestinal channel.
The triptophan byproducts from L. reuteri are not known to develop as in humans, but the genes related to the tripptofan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage because these cells control the inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, L. reuteri's current situation is a high level of triptofan that causes this population to spread."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United signed a genius with Nemanja Matic.
After playing his first game against Sampdoria on Wednesday night, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic.
The 40 million-pound transfer from Chelsea began with a 2-1 win in Dublin prior to the UEFA Super Bowl against Real Madrid on Tuesday in United's pre-season match, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were in a position to be in a position to press forward on their whims.
However, Matic, who was left out on his pre-season Asian tour, was severely out of shape, and was only able to get out for 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that it had to be healed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his way of thinking... he's thinking about football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready sooner."
While Mourinho began to shape the first 11 for the season, his new transfer mates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also played at the Aviva Stadium, such as Matic.
The Independent found out that Mourinho still wanted three more transfers this week, but that the club had already completed three of its four priority transfers, insisting that it had "extraordinary work".
"I thank the club for taking three out of four," he added.
"I'd be happier if they took four out of four, but they've made a great effort for me."
197 people were sent to the hospital last year.
The diagnosis of gender dissatisfaction in 100,000 people in 2005 has increased to 8 per cent in 2015, according to the data of the ISVA Social Prosperity Agency.
Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital received transfers to most of the children and 197 young people who were unhappy with the gender they were born with last year.
Louise Frisen, a child psychiatrist at the same hospital, said the increase could be caused by becoming a more open society, saying, "The openness in the psycho-sexual field, including questions about sexual identity, may be perceived as a general improvement in society."
It is known that gender dissatisfaction has no connection to sexual orientation.
Drug operation in Izmir
In response to the report, the department of the paid-up District Police Department Anti-Smuggling and Organised Crime Bureau carried out an operation on the home of 36-year-old F.T. on Yömer Street on September 3rd.
A search of the house captured a delicate scale with 33 ecstasy pills.
F.T., who tried to jump off the balcony and escape, was arrested and taken into custody.
It has been noted that F.T. will be transferred to the courthouse following police procedures.
Transferred at Home New Malatyaspor
One of the new teams of the Super League, Evur New Malatyaspor, joined the colors of the winger Turgut Dogan Falcon, who wore the November jersey last season.
According to the yellow-black club, the 29-year-old wing player signed a two-year contract as part of the transfer.
"The two-year deal was reached with the winger Turgut Dogan Falcon, who played for Kassimpasa.
Good luck with our new Malatyaspor."
The British inventor micro-chipped himself into his house and his car with a hand gesture.
A British inventor became the first person in the country to be plugged into a microchip so that he could open his front door, access his office, and even start his car with just one hand move.
Steven Northam (33) transferred the tiny chip between his thumb and his finger, which is now being provided by his company BioTeq, whose company wants to facilitate their lives with technology.
To ensure that the implant procedure could be implemented by medical standards, he went to work with Dr. Geoff Watson, who was a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants, Winchester.
Technology is similar to the microchip that was transferred to cats and dogs, and it only lasts 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will change the locks on houses and vehicles, including £300 a lock to match the chip.
The husband and the father of a child, both his house and BMW Z4, were hooked up with this technology, and his vehicle was running while his hands were behind the wheel.
White House Show Cost Taxpayers Thousands
According to military records released to TIME, the White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter into the south lawn last month for an event that suggested American production cost taxpayers $24,000.
When the president boarded, Green and White Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the center of attention in the organization that identified American construction programs at the White House on July 17th.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials have traveled across 50 counties.
The helicopter in Connecticut was displayed alongside a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House War Office requested the location of the helicopter only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the south lawn for an "unusual" organization.
The commander of HMX-1 sent an e-mail to his superior Marine Corps Air Command Officer the day before the event, saying, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware of it because this is an extraordinary high-visibility organization."
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the south lawn at around 7:00 a.m. on the morning of July 17th for the event at 3:00 p.m. where it would remain until the grass was cleared from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.
The note added that if the exit from the White House was delayed, it would require a second flight for a return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.
The original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel were standing in the aircraft on the ground.
From the records provided to TIME, it's unclear whether a second flight crew is ultimately necessary.
Hatch's Law forbids federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 is investigating whether or not the organization violates that requirement.
"One question we asked was whether or not he violated the Hatch Law, and it was reported to us that he did not."
"It looks like you've been locked down," answered the Deputy Commander.
The organization "Made in America" has been designated as an official organization by the White House and is not covered by the Hatch Law.
But even formal organizations have political implications.
At the time, the president referred to the ongoing efforts to reform health care in the senate and praised efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly new.
The presidents need to use them to travel.
But it's unusual for them to be officially used for a photo op.
In February, Trump noted that the presidential plane was full of messages about the use of the president's plane when the first campaign rally in Melbourne Florida moved backstage and the Twitter account's predecessor.
"The White House is excited by the exhibition of 'Made in America' with American products made by American workers from all 50 states," White House Deputy Press spokesman Lindsay Walters said.
The crew of the HMX-1 are often training in the Washington area, and they're training to leave the President of the United States on the south lawn with a stop shot to the White House.
At the beginning of July, Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit, and HMX-1 did 58 exercises at the White House.
One official said that the flight for the Made in America organization counted the need for training for the air crew during that month.
Unit helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for non-presidential support missions.
The White House said taxpayers were not charged for any other number in the organisation.
A spokesman from Sikorksky said their firms did not participate in arranging the helicopter's exhibition on the south lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't keep budget records for presidential flights, and it's hard to determine the exact cost provided by the organization.
But according to the Ministry of Defense's hourly rate for the fiscal year of 2017, the Ministry of Defense's rate of VH-3D is $24,340 per flight hour.
The unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the base of Marine Corps Air Fashion Quantico in Virginia.
The White House claims the helicopter's real operating costs are well below that.
"It is very misleading to tax taxpayers to make an expense based on estimate of the expense rate," Walters said.
"These proportional estimates cover the poor costs involved in personnel, maintenance and annual expenses."
According to a RAND study in 2015, the Department of Defense's expense rates do not cover staff costs, but include fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Back then, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for this organization.
"The idea here is to show what's been done in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I think hundreds of people's jobs depend on it, even if they're not thousands.
And like most Americans, I think we're all very proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans work tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's appropriate to bring it forward."
It's unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while traveling south lawns for the event, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump joked with the media about the company's products in his own fleet, and called to the representatives of Sikorsky.
The president said, "I know about Sikorsky very well." He said, "I have three of them."

According to the U.N., Afghan democracy depends on women's political role
On Wednesday, the head of B.M.'s mission in Afghanistan said the elections could be representative if all parts of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, deputy chairman of the U.M. Assistance Mission, says hundreds of women compete in the provinceal council elections, three women compete for vice president, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be exaggerated," he said in his statement Wednesday.
Elections can be truly representative and reliable if only women participate fully and are included in all parts of the election process.
Afghan province council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban threatened the election process, which coincided with the time when international military operations became advisory.
This year's elections point to the peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said women's strong role would contribute to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports 1.2 million registered women from 3.6 million registered voters.

McVitie's investment in the Glasgow plant concerns about GMB
A union wants assurances from the managers of biscuit maker McVitie's about long-term commitments to production at his factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross region.
Among other products, more than 500 people work in the factory where the Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits are produced.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said they've invested over £5 million in the area in the last few years.
If his operations change, he added, employees and union representatives will be "first informed".
In a letter to the company's plant manager, GMB Scotland requested McVitie's "to address concerns that there is no funding for the modernisation of production bands".
"Our members are deeply concerned about the need for jobs from the chief of staff and the lack of clarity about Tollcross's investment plan for the future.
For generations, families have worked here and are gathered in the local community and in Glasgow and the suburbs, where there is a critical basis for adequate employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
From the perspective of business, salary and prosperity, Brexit urgently needs a four-piece production presence at the east end of Glasgow, McVitie's, against increasing cost of living and chronic production."
"The head of the facility in Tollcross received a letter from the GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly because we value our commitment to workers and union representatives.
Two months ago at Tollcross, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives, where a few questions were clearly discussed.
So we explained to our employees that we are constantly reviewing our operations, so that we can remain competitive, like all companies in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, which is for all of our jobs and facilities.
"In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross facility, especially production bands and operational development.
We fully recognise Tollcross' legacy as a production facility, and their union representatives and employees will be the first to know if our operations at the facility change."
Necip and Utku four more years in Beşiktas
The Beşiktaş Club extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku EvuKuran for four years.
Besiktaş extended a contract with the two players until May 31st 2021, in a section of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) website that contains data on football players.
Necip, who grew up in the infrastructure of the black-and-white team and signed his first professional contract on June 19, 2008, began to play for A in the 2009–2010 season.
He was born in 1991, until he became captain of the team, and played in a total of 254 official matches in Besiktaş's jersey.
The TFF website also included information that Besiktas had signed a contract with him until May 31st 2021, after receiving Utku Kuvuran's bonus, the goalie who hired him last season.
Utku's information on the website is that he was granted temporary transfer status as of August 1, 2017 and that his license was renewed on August 2nd.
Utku Yuvuran served in Beşiktas, where he was hired last season, mostly in the Under-21 League.
The young goalie took part in only two Turkish Cup matches with the black-and-white jersey.
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago that Neymar was leaving?
La Liga may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain won't stop following Neymar after proposing the 189 million-pound release clause, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record three years ago?
With Ligue 1 team ready to break the world-transport record more than twice as much last season as Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for £89 million, the sensational proposal moved through the summer transfer period.
With the PSG offering $500,000 a week's salary after taxes, Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and the most profitable professional athlete at the same time.
Although a source close to Katalan's administration insisted that the club was always doing its best to keep an eye on him from Santos' arrival in 2013, Barcelona has been known to be angry about the way the offer was proposed and Neymar's efforts to break up.
So, was the football world warned by the head of PSG about this view three years ago?
When he expressed his interest in signing Manchester City Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi gave a strong warning to all clubs who wanted to sign one of the best players at PSG.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be against them, and we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign off on one of our players, they'll suffer the consequences."
Early this summer, Spanish club Barcelona seemed to have crossed that line by expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
The PSG has made it clear that they will not allow the Italian nation to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona feels its reflections by losing Neymar from their greatest value.
The sentence for blocking the raft has been overturned.
The defendants Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yılmaz, who allegedly tried to stop Gültepe Imam Mustafa Baki, the Gültepe Mosque's Imami, who read Ezan and Sela, were accused of “intentionally and deliberately helping the organization”, “resisting against the organization”, “insistance” and “insult”.
He was tried by the High Criminal Court.
Taking into consideration the victim's complaint of "insulting the public officer for his duty" and the way the crime was committed, the court board decided that the defendant Yılmaz should be sentenced to 7,000 liras in fines and sentenced him to one year in prison for "defending the public and Turkey's future by the date and time of the crime".
The delegation ruled that Yilmaz's prison sentence would be reduced to 6,000 lira fines.
After the two defendants were fined, the defendant's attorneys filed a complaint.
İstanbul District Court Court for investigation of the case is now in 23rd.
He came to the Department of Corrections.
The agency completed its investigations and decided that the sentence against the defendant, Kenan Gülşen, on charges of "insult", had been carried out in the legal context, that the act had been described as correct and that it had followed the type of crime that was foreseen in the law, and that it had been rejected from the ground to the ground.
When he met Mustafa Baki, the imam who read the flood of the defendant Nait Yilmaz and came out of the mosque by the High Criminal Court, he said, "You're not putting people out on the street."
The President has been taken.
"This job is over," he said, adding that the act of attempting to strike him was said to have caused "resisted" to be admitted that the victim's Imam had to read at intervals, causing him to be unable to read the word "resist" and "resistant to not get the job done".
Despite the grounds stated by the local court, the action took place at the time the victim completed his sela and equivocal reading mission and informed the public in front of the mosque, the agency said that there was no mission in the concrete case, that the victim had started or continued to perform its work, and that the defendant had not been discussed whether or not he had committed an attempted attempt to wound the victim due to his public duty, and that the defendant had tried to prevent the following tasks, had been determined on an insufficient basis, without being allowed to be determined.
The defendant's lack of a criminal record, the agency explaining that the victim's physical financial harm was not made due to the crimes being placed on the defendant, and that the moral damage did not prevent the application of the release of the verdict, and that it would not be applied to the victim's complaint.
On these grounds, the agency has decided that the verdict against the defendant will be overturned and that the case will be returned to the first degree court.
Six Europeans on Interpol's list of live bombs
German newspaper Die Welt wrote that Interpol sent a list of 173 people with the potential to launch suicide attacks on behalf of the terrorist organization in May.
The 132 people on the list are reportedly from Iraq, North Africa, the Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six people on the list were reported to be European citizens.
They come from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia, it is said.
The person with a DEAŞ connection from Germany has reportedly been a 27-year-old German citizen from Solingen, North Rhine, Westphalia.
In the fall of 2012, the person reportedly went to Egypt, followed by Turkey, then to Syria.
This person was reported dead in Rakka in mid-July, the DEAŞ said in its social media accounts.
The German Police Department has been informed that the newspaper has not answered its questions on the subject.
The names on Interpol's list were claimed to have been seized in operations against the DEAŞ in Musul.
According to Die Welt, U.S. intelligence services have reviewed this list and sent it to Interpol.
Interpol also released the list to police agencies in Europe in May.
ISIS could attempt to send some of the names on this list to Europe to organise suicide attacks, Die Welt reported, based on German security circles.
The horror of a shotgun and a soldier's farewell: Five-year-old Star may lose his eye
In Job, there was blood in the soldiers' farewell.
A large group gathered in the park in the Blackhall neighborhood to see their fellow soldiers off the other night.
The M.K. and E.A. allegedly fired at the air from time to time with shotguns.
After the soldiers' farewell, the group began to break up.
M.K. walked past a playground full of kids and fired a shotgun into the ground.
Five people were injured, one of whom was sitting on the park bench because of the nonsense that was hanging from the ground.
Those moments were reflected in the park's security cameras.
The wounded are Ferhat Turan, Ercan Turan, Destiny Balkır, Star Unus, Pearl Kaya in the surrounding hospitals.
Five-year-old Star Unus, who was treated at the hospital, was said to be at risk of losing his left eye.
Starsu's grandmother, Mary Kaya, told DHA about those moments.
Kaya said it happened when his grandson was in his lap. "The military celebration began at 8:00."
It took two hours.
Soldier fun's all over.
Young people are starting to fall apart.
When it was over, it would have been the same for us to get up.
That's when the gun went off, right in front of me.
My grandson is not well.
There's an 80-90 percent chance of losing your eye.
We talked to the doctor, that's what he said.
They took out one of the crazy ones, and the other one's right in your eye.
He said, "He's had an operation, maybe 10 surgeries."
The suspect, M.K. and E.A., were arrested and taken into custody by the Security Department of Eyüp district police.
Two people who were sent to the courthouse following questioning in police have been arrested by the court.
