The professor confessed to killing his girlfriend by calling 911.
University Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told the police that he shot his girlfriend with a gun and that the police were supposed to come to the houses in a shaky voice.
Lamb said that his "lovely dog" was alive and probably sad and that the dead woman's parents' phones could be found on her cell phone.
The cops found Amy Prentiss's lifeless body and a note in a white notebook, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo everything, I loved Amy so much, and she was the only woman who ever loved me."
There was no indication that Lamb, who gave two online lectures at Delta State University in Mississippi, Cleveland, had already traveled 300 miles to the school campus where police favorite history professor Ethan Scmidt was shot and killed by Lamb in front of his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard shots at 10:18.
Lamb made his desperate 911 call shortly after that, he said.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as the police approached him.
The day after the school shooting caused students and professors to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still investigating what drove Lamb to do it.
On both sides of the state, the details of students and staff who knew about him drew a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students said they're looking forward to taking his class.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said Lamb had no criminal record and no criminal record.
In fact, Schmidt wrote a book about Lamb as one of the "great people" he shared his academic life with.
They both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members were listed, and many students learned from both.
However, there were signs of mental problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who spoke highly of Lamb, said he was also a concerned and nervous person and seemed to have a "problem".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb had told him that he was suffering from stress in the late 2014–15 school year.
Lamb said he'd had some medical problems before, asking Delta State University for sick leave.
This year he only taught two classes online.
The recent changes in the university's hiring policies could not guarantee that Lamb would automatically become a tenured lecturer despite his doctorate degree, which Lamb worked very hard to win.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that it was obvious that Lamb had something on his mind.
These are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the campus was evacuated, the police traced Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Criminal Investigation Director Methel Johnson announced that his family committed suicide with a single .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile from his home in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi.
Lamb's car was found running on the highway.
Even though it's not clear why Lamb went to this house immediately, Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived in this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at 3,500 students' universities of about 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 and taught geography and education.
He got his PhD in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston said that she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a really nice guy who tried to teach him how to play guitar for a few years.
Back then, he was a beater of hearts.
Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon City, said to Lamb, "All the girls would melt when he arrived."
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for a while.
The 911 call said Lamb killed my wife, but there's no official record of them getting married.
They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on Gautier near a river.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they got divorced 15 years ago, but he and Prentiss were always friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also stated that her daughter was completely devastated.
He and his mother were great friends.
He said he'd never met O'Steen Lamb, but his daughter Abigail heard Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail were performing at a summer festival.
Then Lamb and Abigail played together in general shows.
O'Steen stated that his daughter wrote and sang her music.
Prentiss was a nurse for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room near Gautier, said Lamb and Prentiss last saw Lamb finish playing guitar and harmonica to a few viewers on the night of September 5th.
There was no sign of trouble.
He said they were quite a happy couple.
Sometimes we'd cut and throw a line at each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the same university, said that Schmidt, the murdered professor, directed a seminar for first-years and was an expert on Native American and colonial history.
He was married and had three young children.
He graduated from the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a student solidarity group he founded.
On Tuesday night at the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, about 900 people attended a candle-planting ceremony, including academics, university workers, students and local visitors.
Schmidt's wife, Liz and her brother, Jeff Schmidt, attended the college choir's memorial service, singing "Glorious Morning Star" and "Excellence".
Classes continue on Wednesday.
"We are trying to bring back our students," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to heal the wounds.

Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (in Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (in New Orleans) contributed.
This article was corrected to reflect that Lamb called 911 after he killed Schmidt, and Lamb called 911, but there was no official evidence that the two had been married, even though he called Prentiss his wife.
Toys R Us Plans to Get Less Holiday Season Employees
Toys R Us announced this year that he would not hire as many holiday season employees as last year, but the company, which produces toys and doll products, said it would allow its current employees and seasonal workers to work more.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in store and distribution centres across the country. During the 2014 holiday season, the number was 45,000.
Most of the work will be part-time.
The company said the interviews with the candidates will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months away, the holiday shopping season is coming up, and companies are preparing to hire temps to help them decorate their stores and sell, send and distribute products.
Michael J. Fox made jokes about his relationship with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
And for personal reasons, it was very important.
"We were sitting in the movie hall waiting for members of the Royal Family to arrive, and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty and that Princess Diana would sit next to me.
The movie started, and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was a fake stretch and a stretch away from me.
It includes interviews with Back in Time, Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and practical producer Steven Spielberg, a documentary on "Back to the Future".
Back to the Future was the first time it was ever released 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time travel movie ever made for me."
In addition to the Back in Time VOD and DVD formats, it will be shown in some distinguished cinemas.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Regarding Russia's growing military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the five-year-old Syrian problem "can't be solved by military intervention" and that more weapons will only be more violence and pain for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General has invited all sides, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together and negotiate constructive talks to find a political solution to the problem.
At a press conference Wednesday, Ban said he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France at a meeting of the UN General Assembly, which will be held at the end of the month.
He expressed great regret that the division between the council members and the Syrian people "has made the problem unsolvable" by the regional forces.
Ban invited five permanent members to join forces in the Syrian crisis, as did the Iranian nuclear deal.
Eight Polls Showing That Donald Trump Is Serious
Some of them tried to label it as an incendiary.
The others threw him off like it was a joke.
And some of them support the internal explosion.
Although some Republicans tried to bring Donald Trump down in the polls, it didn't work yet.
The latest 11 national surveys showed him Donald Trump's leadership in double digits, and some are really starting to ask for the real estate emperor's chance to run.
Of course, it's early in the election cycle.
None of this means Trump can win the Republican nomination.
Experts say that Rick Perry's rise at this time in 2011 also led to a rise for Herman Cain, both of which failed to win the nomination process in a single state.
And there's a lot of reasons he'll have trouble with the general election.
But like Jeb Bush's Super PAC group and the economic conservative growth club, the outside groups recognize Trump's permanent power and start spending dollars to take him down.
Here are some recent poll results showing that the real estate emperor isn't just passing through:
Trump's preference rate has changed 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth University showed that two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view for the real estate emperor.
In mid-July, that was 40 percent.
Early in August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of ten Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Roughly 10 of them say three of them have negative vision.
And these numbers are going up in the early stages.
Last week, a poll in Quinnipiac, Iowa showed that 60 percent of the Republicans there prefer Donald Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters can be happy with the Trump nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 per cent of Republicans said that if Trump ran, they would be "excited" or "satisfied".
Only two out of 10 people said they'd be "sorry" if he was the candidate.
It's just the same level of enthusiasm as Ben Carson Trump (40 percent for Trump, when he said they'd be 43 percent "excited".
The other person closest to the rush?
Only 21 percent Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican voters say that if Jeb Bush, the institution's favorite, runs, they will "not be pleased" or "will be sad".
Most Republicans don't see Trump's nature as a problem.
Donald Trump is criticised for his fancy language and insults, while 52 per cent of Republicans questioned Monday's ABC News/ Washington Post poll thinks that the real estate emperor has the right temperament to be president.
The same figure is true in Iowa, where the country's first party assembly will be held, where according to Quinnipac last week, 52 per cent of Republicans think he has the personality to lead.
Still 44 per cent thinks he does not have the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six out of 10 independents say his nature does not fit the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their political expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of 10 said Trump was the best when asked who the best candidate was to win the GOP nomination.
It's a change from the end of July when four out of 10 put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, GOP voters' crystal ball was not clear.
During the last election cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry was going to run, and only 28 percent chose Mitt Romney, who was finally running.
Still, the majority of GOP voters seem to find Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans gather around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts also point out that the disorganized area may contribute to Trump's presence, and it is also true that the anti-Trump support has been distributed among more than a dozen candidates.
A Monmouth University poll, however, conducted in early September, shows that Trump has always received support from the majority in the event of a single match between Trump and many Republican candidates.
Carly scores 13 points for Fiorina, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie each with 33 points.
It's a draw with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
In the event of a possible head start, Ben Carson beats the businessman by 19 points.
The majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made their decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday shows that more than half of the voters who supported Trump have locked their vote.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say that they won't change their mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch candidates.
Trump's biggest rival is still a neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, but voters who say they've made their decisions are twice as close to voting for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapers" two months ago in his campaign announcement, immigration has been the subject of talks in the beginning and centre of 2016.
Some feel that Trump's too much talk has driven the key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and will damage their efforts to rebrand.
But six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration issues, according to the new ABC/Post survey on Monday.
So as long as immigration is on the agenda, Trump seems to be on the agenda.
The anger of the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are roughly taking half the Republican vote because of their largely outside state.
Six out of every 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post survey on Monday say they want an outsider instead of one with government experience.
And they're mad at Washington.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey in Iowa showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa were angry with the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were "unsatisfied" and 21 percent were "extremely angry".
In the Prime Minister's Questions, Jeremy Corbyn will take the stand for the first time.
Since the day he was elected, Mr. Corbyn was eagerly expected to take the stand in the program Questions to the Prime Minister.
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will take the stand in the Prime Minister's Questions after David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will be asking six questions shortly this afternoon, and his performance appears to be closely reviewed by the media and Labour MPs.
He called "less theater and more real" in the weekly show.
He also said he could skip some sessions by leaving them to his colleagues.
The match will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbyn's leadership, where he appoints the shadow cabinet and follows his speech at the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's silence during the reading of the national anthem at the memorial ceremony to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the British War on Tuesday was criticised by some Tory MPs and focused on front-page news.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to accompany the national anthem drew attention.
A spokesman who spoke for Mr. Corbyn said he stood in a "respectful silence" and appreciated "the heroicness of the Royal Air Force in the British War".
However, Owen Smith, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, told the BBC Two's News Night program that he would recommend the Labour Party leader sing the national anthem as "independent" from his belief in the elimination of the monarchy.
Due to the differences in economic, defence and foreign relations, about a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's upper staff, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that policy differences within the Labour Party have also begun to "deploy", and that these are the issues of Mr Corbyn's appointment to the European Union and the government's implementation of the upper limit on aid.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party has offered new changes to the removal of the upper limit altogether.
Hours later, the shadow work and retirement minister, Mr. Smith, said the party was only opposed to the government reducing its top limit to £23,000, which was only 26,000, and was "very clear" about it.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Party leader David Cameron will face on the bench of the common cabin from the day David Cameron became the Conservative Party leader.
Labour leader promised a different approach to politics and said he had received "public-based" and more than 30,000 recommendations to ask Mr. Cameron.
Islington North MP told the Prime Minister that the Question Program is too controversial and will focus on poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people rather than exchange sarcasm with "responsibility".
Mr. Corbyn told the Prime Minister that when Mr. Cameron traveled abroad, for example, he would be represented by shadow trade minister Angela Eagle in the Question program.
He even suggested that other colleagues should take the stand from time to time, and said he had applied to John Bercow, the spokesman for the House of Commons, to discuss the matter.
In 2005, when he became a leader, Mr. Cameron expressed his desire to get away from politics in the "Kukla Game", often associated with the program of Questions, but a few years later, he confessed to failing.
Since its first release in 1990, the programme of Questions to the Prime Minister has been used as a basic measuring point to gauge the decision-making capabilities of leaders, the domination of the House of Commons and its MPs; in response, some critics said it was caricatured and needed extensive reforms.
'Apparently taken in Joburg: Homeless youth studying photography
Johannesburg City is a tough place for homeless people.
But a group of old street kids found a way to earn a new talent and make a living.
I was shot in Joburg, a nonprofit studio that teaches homeless teenagers to take pictures of their neighborhoods and make a profit out of it.

The price increases in the United Kingdom, and the pounds rise.
Following the data that shows increased prices in the United Kingdom, the pound has seen a rapid rise, while the FTSE 100 index has risen after an offer of acquisition for SABMiller.
Prices in the United Kingdom have increased by 2.9% from May to July, compared to the same period in the previous year.
This figure, which represents the fastest increase since 2009, is also viewed as one of the leading indicators for possible interest increases.
Sterling gained more than $1.5505 for the US dollar and 0.84 per cent for the euro, reaching 1.3730 euros.
The FTSE 100 Index rose to 6,229.21 points with an increase of 1.49%.
The most prominent company in this rise was SABMiller, who received a 20% increase from his rival, EU Inbev, with an attractive acquisition offer.
This offer will unite the two largest beer companies in the world, and famous brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will meet under the same roof.
Burberry shares have risen 0.9% in the influence of positive profits from the rival luxury retail group Richemont.
Richemont's current sales figures also showed that sales in China, which is one of the key markets for Burberry, are starting to grow again.
The shares of Glencore, the mining giant, rose 5% after he announced that he made $2.5 billion from the company's stake sale as part of its strategy to reduce its debt.
Packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were among the most valued shares after Goldman Sachs dropped his proposal for the company to "Sat", with a loss of 4.3%.
JD Sports' share rose 3.1% after it announced that the company's six-month tax profit increased by 83% to £46.6m.
JD Sports boss said higher salaries could damage expansion.
JD Sports Board Chairman Peter Cowgill said that the minimum wage for workers in England could mean "the power to spend more in the pockets of potential consumers".
However, according to him, he said that his spending power would not exceed the expense of his own company.
Costs will affect JD Sports' expansion plans, which could mean less extra work, he added.
Metcash has launched a public campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market wholesaler Metcash launched a public campaign to defend retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against the 700m Aldi invasion.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers, and are trying to create an IGA brand with mainstream and social media marketing and activities such as Adelaide's fair.
IGA peyotes and suppliers also contribute to brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo, which offers flavor tests at IGA stores, and to loyal customers who sell discounted South Australian football league tickets.
Metcash, a food, liquor and hardware wholesaler, is expected to present more details about the defence strategy as the annual investor strategy improves on 29 September.
The risk is great, because the IGA store of South Australia and Western Australia represents almost 30% of Metcash's footprint, and produces more profit margins than the IGA network in Metcash's eastern provinces.
South Australia and Western Australia store owners are negatively narrow-minded and enjoy a much stronger market share than they get in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; compared to eastern states, 30% in the GA and 24% in the BA.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take over about 5% of the market market within the 12 months of opening their first store in these two states, and will take away the current sales from current players, but generally without a record retailer.
In a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers would lose 360 million dollars in a year and Metcash would lose $250m by the end of 2016.
This is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 30 stores in the GA next year and in BA, and will get $500 million and $600 million in sales per market.
Mr. Kierath said that the loss of food and market sales and Metcash's high fixed cost base volumes could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and tax.
At the same time, Metcash loses his market share in the eastern states, primarily Aldi and Coles, despite recent research into Roy Morgan, which reveals that IGA clients are the most loyal customers.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's food and market sales will decrease by 4.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, reducing market share from 14% in 2015 to 2020% in 2020.
Last week, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, said Metcash could "most likely be erased in ten years" at a business dinner in Melbourne.
Metcash refused to respond to Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it appears a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
The market share of the IGA has dropped from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash's food and market profits providing supplies to about 1,200 IGA retailers have dropped 43% since 2012, as sales and margins enter under pressure, a sign that business leverage rates have decreased.
But the wholesaler resists, and every week in Coles and Woolworths, he invests over $150 million a year in shelf prices that match the face-to-face product, helping IGA retailers renovate their stores, adding faster-growing fresh foods, and opening a better customized market series.
Ian Morrice, chairman of the Metcash executive board, says that prices match and store renovation programmes are beginning to yield results, and the wholesaler is expected to return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokinakis is supported by the president of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Thanasi Kokinakis deserves more credit than criticism for his behavior.
According to the president of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy, Thanasi was the accidentally damaged party in his friend Nick Kyrgios' last storm around him, and he deserves more credit than criticism.
Kokinakis, a young member of the "Special K's" duo, found Kyrgios beneath the spotlight of Montreal Masters, which did not appreciate Stan Wawrinka's embarrassing crush on him.
"Wawrinka came at Kyrgios, and I have to go after him."
Kokinakis, last seen breaking his racket to potentially upset Richard Gasquet at the US Open, was loyally defended by Healy.
The young player is currently in Glasgow with Sam Groth in the Davis Cup semifinals, competing against Britain for the second singles post behind Bernard Tomic.
"What I feel quite enthusiastic about is that I think that Thanasi has been drawn to the debate," Healy said.
He broke his racket when he closed down and lost in the U.S., but he's not the first player to break the racket because he's disappointed in himself, and I know Thanasi is well aware that he shouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, in the U.S., he handled himself quite well under very provocative circumstances with Harrison and the others, and I think he deserves a lot of praise.
He's got a great team around him, a great family, and I think he's gone a little overboard.
Although he's 19 years old, he's very mature, he's working hard and he's adapting to the team, he's got no problem with the other players, he's being treated with a lot of respect in the locker room, he's been practicing hard, he's a very stable, mature young man, and I think he deserves to be judged in his own parables.
Healy also supported his decision to tolerate Kyrgios for the important draw; from Friday on Friday, he began to explain that the right thing for everyone to do is to "reciprocal decision" but to support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term blacksmith.
"First of all, we want the team to focus on the game, not on the conflicts around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think, as people like Nick, Federer and Murray have pointed out, the boy is growing up in front of the public, and he's made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he's not in the spotlight, he thinks that my thinking is appropriate, that it's best for him and the team.
European immigrant crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders and detains immigrants
Hungary blocked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, declaring an emergency to cut off the flow of immigrants, and detained people trying to enter the country illegally.
With hundreds of immigrants piled up in neutral zones, the border would create chaos, and Serbian officials acted furiously.
Emigrants, who fled from violence in their own country, settled in these tents on the side of the road for an uncertain period of time between the two countries’ checkpoints.
But their anger was growing.
As a police helicopter passed through the top, the migrants shouted, "Open the border!" and insulted the Hungarian riot police.
Others rejected the water and food they were given as protests.
The Serbian Foreign Minister said it is "inadmissible" for Hungary to send immigrants back as an immigrant current from Macedonia and Greece continues.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not be harmed in the process.
In the coming days, talks will be required with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
This tension at the Hungarian-Serbia border occurred a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 immigrants who attacked Greece and Italy, and voiced hope that by the end of next month or year, more than 120,000 immigrants, including those from Hungary, would be agreed to accept them into EU countries.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria urged on Tuesday that an EU summit be held next week to discuss this refugee crisis facing the continent.
Hungary has little hope that Brussels or its neighbours will take any concrete action on the issue.
The emergency call issued Tuesday in two southern regions gives authorities broad powers to fight the crisis, including blocking the roads necessary and speeding up cases related to asylum seekers.
On the other hand, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country plans to draw barbed wire along the border with Romania to stop the flow of immigrants from moving through Serbia.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata announced that even prisoners in prisons were assigned to pull barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
For the past few months, Hungary has become an important gateway and transit point for the European Union countries, and many of them are refugees who have escaped wars in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the immigrants who have arrived are "economic immigrants" trying to move to Europe for a better life rather than innocent people who have come to escape the war -- which is completely contrary to the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The laws in Hungary, which took effect at midnight, also bring harsher punishments to human traffickers, as well as the 4m (13 feet) long barbed wire to the border with Serbia (13 feet) that makes it a crime to cross or damage it.
"The Hungarian government declares an emergency because of the situation caused by the mass migration," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in Szeged, in the southern city.
We have a clear idea: illegally crossing the border is a crime.
Although military deployment needs to be approved by parliament yet, Associated Press reporters in the region say they have seen heavily armed dogs and vehicles here for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 45 people who had crossed the border and 15 who had entered the country.
They crossed the barbed wire, now in police custody and are charged with crimes according to new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing barbed wire.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, while using a train car covered with barbed wire to close one of the crossings.
While Hungarians activated a small metal container, where people packed in for processing, chaos was reflected at the main border crossing near Roszke.
Even if 20 people could get in, thousands of them stayed out.
Another group of immigrants said they would not accept food and water supplies until they were allowed to enter Hungary by blocking the highway connecting Serbia and Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders is cut in half in the national election
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to lead the two-digit race for the national nomination, but you. Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton is currently second in position with Sanders up 27% (out of 17%) while taking 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58 %).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is in the presidential race, receives 15% of the democratic vote.
Over the past five months before the main races began, most Democratic voters said it was too early to decide which candidate they would support.
Clinton's supporters, however, have more solid opinions on their own choices than on other candidates.
Since CBS News last month, Clinton's been losing the floor between a series of demographic groups, and Sanders, on the other hand, has had some gains.
Clinton's got a big head start between women and moderates, but that's closing.
His support among men has dropped considerably, and Sanders is only following him five points behind.
Clinton's Democratic voter advantage under 50 has evaporated, and he and Sanders are even now.
Clinton, however, has a huge head start on the rights for older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sander with two digits between liberals, but now Sanders is five points ahead of this group.
Nearly half of the democratic voters on the national level say they will passionately support Clinton if he becomes the party's candidate.
One quarter will support him on certain conditions, while another 15 per cent will support him only if he becomes a candidate.
Six percent don't support Clinton.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters tend to support him passionately.
The views between those who don't support Clinton now are even more complicated -- only a quarter of them can support him passionately.
48 per cent of the Democrats express their passionate support for Clinton, while less Republican leading candidates talk about Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked open-ended questions about why they want Clinton to run, the first row answers are the idea that he has the right experience (16 per cent), that it's time to elect a female president (13 per cent) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also express his relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
To be a compromiser in problems and to be elected is also one of the criteria.
As vice president with potential for the presidency, 57 per cent of the Democratic voters would like to see him in the race, but one third of them do not think so.
Biden is next in line when democratic voters are asked what the second candidate election for the party is.
According to Sander, more than half of Clinton's supporters say Biden may have had a clear second choice.
If Biden doesn't enter the Democratic Candidate race, Hillary Clinton's superiority over Sanders is increasing to 30 points in a race with Biden score 20 points.
Fifty-five per cent of the Democratic voters see Clinton as the best candidate to win general elections, but that number dropped from 78 per cent last month.
Biden's second in line, but he's far behind, but the percentage of those who see him as the most eligible candidate has increased.
Again, when asked what is the most important thing in a candidate, Democratic voters put matters ahead of selection.
Unlike last month, no Democratic voter candidate or candidate candidate seems to be considered unacceptable for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or candidates perform well in some of the main characteristics among the primary voters of their own parties.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy, and powerful leadership.
Biden is first among the three, and Clinton is strong in leadership.
According to 30 per cent of the Democratic voters, Clinton is dishonest and unreliable, and half of that says the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent) and 27 per cent have no idea.
Democratic voters also view Clinton, Sanders and Biden in general as their own ideology.
In all the criteria, a quarter of the Democratic voters have no idea about Sanders.
As questions continue about his personal e-mail address and use of his server during his office at the State Department, most Democratic voters find the statement satisfactory and say his views on the issue are unaffected.
But that's a different story in the general American public.
Half the Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations, but only one third find them satisfying.
The public's views on the issue were divided in March, shortly after the problem was taken under the lens.
Most Americans say the e-mail debates do not affect their general opinion of Clinton, while on the other hand, their negative ideas have increased by 36 per cent.
They're Republicans in general, and more than six out of 10 say they've lost their views on Clinton.
Although Clinton is considered honest and reliable by his party's voters, the issue is still generally one of the registered voters: only 32% consider him honest and trustworthy, and the figure dropped eight points last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty percent of registered voters don't find him honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters registered all over the country don't think Trump is honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are getting good marks on leadership.
Among the six candidates who took the test, Biden, Carson and Bush scored the best points for honesty.
More people find Sanders honest most of the time, but like Carson, most of them don't have an opinion about him.
The error margin in samples taken from 351 Democrats is 6%.
Ben Carson is right behind Donald Trump in the national polls.
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson is running behind Donald Trump.
The new poll shows that about half of the two candidates have the vote, other candidates have little chance.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, with your support 23% in the last CBS poll held before last month's debate at Fox News, climbing to 27% in the poll released Tuesday.
However, support for Carson rose from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The survey also found that Carson was doing well in demographic groups, and the support among university-educated Republican voters was much higher than Trump.
The rest are now down to 2% now from support, which was 10 percent last month with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, except for Carly Fiorina and John Kasich, Governor of Ohio.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio ranked third with 6%.
The latest poll, with 376 people elected from Republican voters, was made 6% of the margin of error, and the survey was conducted in September.
Last CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson's support among Republicans to 19% behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post showed Trump seriously in front of Carson.
Faced with Carson's rise last week, Trump apologized for questioning Carson Trump's faith, but kept shaking at random to the retired neurosurgeon.
Last Saturday at a campaign stop in Iowa, Trump said, "We need energy."
Five frat brothers, Baruch College, accused of the death of a freshman.
Nearly two years after the death of a college student in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder was filed against five people.
In September 2013, the brothers of the New York City Baruch College Pi Delta psi attacked Chun "Michael" Deng hard and contributed to his death by delaying taking him to the hospital.
Officials reported that he had been blindfolded, that he had been caught on the back of a backpack full of 30 pounds of sand, and that he was constantly trippin' to the goal of a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained that over time his head was hurting and then he lost consciousness.
The brothers of Pi Delta psi didn't call 911 after Deng passed out, and police say they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
But police Commissioner Chris Wagner, who spoke at the press conference, said they changed Deng's clothes, Googled his symptoms and contacted Andy Meng, the national head of the brotherhood, and asked for advice.
At this point, Commissioner Wagner said the members began to hide their personal belongings and put the best of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng.
He was not revived and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated traumas to the head, torso and thigh with blunt force trauma.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, explained that many families have been destroyed as a result of the brotherhood initiations, and since 1970 at least one student has died every year during initiations.
The brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step is vital to the authorities.
The Monroe County grand jury has recommended a third degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two brothers, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with assault initiation and criminal conspiracy.
At a press conference Tuesday, Wagner said that if there are not only those involved, but if there are organizations who officially or unofficially confirm it, we will hold them responsible.
Baruch College banned brotherhood, and the national brotherhood ended its relationship with this local unit.
What happens when Fed raises interest rates?
With interest rates rising, the bull market is upside down, bond revenues rise, and the economy suffers decline.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to last.
History, especially in the economy, offers very little information about timing.
The decline has taken as long as 86 months as the decline took about 11 months after the initial interest rate increase.
The aggression of the US Central Bank Fed in increasing interest rates has often been decisive in the response of economics and financial assets, not permanently.
That's why U.S. central bank officials strongly emphasize how long the normalization process should take, not when interest is starting to increase.
It's a fact that there are various variables.
However, market participants may feel that the interest increase rush has been exaggerated.
"Since the global financial crisis, it is inevitable that Fed's first increase in interest by some would point to the end of the 'poor' period," Julian Jessop, the Capital Economics Global Consultant told clients.
On the contrary, we don't expect US interest rates to get back to normal gradually, but it appears that most of the levels that are still low are seismic impacts that most of them fear.
Can't say they won't have any effect, though.
Based on past trends, the response of some of the economic areas is:
As seen in the past months in the market, waiting for interest rates to be increased may make things unstable for a while.
The effect won't be that obvious when interest is raised.
"It seems that 12 to 24 months of pause trend after the initial interest increase of equity revenues, which may reflect the pause in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a new study of what will happen after the Fed upgrades.
According to an up-to-date analysis shared by one Nuveen Property Management analyst Bob Doll at Barron's, the market has generally recorded sharp spikes in the past 35 years -- around 14 per cent -- and then, after 250 days, it's on a straight line towards interest increase (average 2.6 per cent) and 500 days later, it's returned to normal and averaged 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles.
Deutsche said the impact on the stocks became more obvious in the next phases of the interest increase cycle, and the return was about to disappear.
The declines are a fact of economic life, but interest increases help them.
In the current situation, Fed is facing some situations that have not existed before and will speed up the decline.
And what's the most remarkable thing is that it's at the lowest level so far for a Fed interest increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the increase of 118 interest rates since 1950, the domestic gross has dropped only under 4.5 per cent twice from the nominal year to year.
Although the second quarter of 2015 took place at 3.6 per cent, according to the Atlanta Fed, it is expected to be permanent by few, while the third quarter is watching at 1.5 per cent.
According to Deutsche, increasing interest rates in such a delicate economic environment can be risky and could lead to the question, "Will it be different this time?"
The focus of market participants who have been awaiting Fed's interest increase for a year is at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
Although most strategists and economist FOMC believe that they can approve an increase in this meeting, the future trade only points to 25 per cent probability.
"In our research since 1950, all increases cycles that have happened to this day have been in a super-climbing trend cycle, and are rapidly reaching pre-restance peaks, which have begun to recover," the report said.
On the contrary, this has been a slow recovery that has not been seen without the worst regression of an exemplary period.
The current cycle was the longest cycle Fed has waited for since the last regression -- the longest loop on record has been 35 months, and the cycle we're in is still in the 74th month.
With interest increase expected in the market, fixed income has become unstable, and order is a bit like equity.
The difference is, when you change the course of Fed policy, the effect is seen faster in bonds than in stocks.
When the first increase/fall of the cycle comes, the bond returns don't change direction immediately.
And at the end of the interest increase cycle, bonds revenues drop instantly," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab, according to strategists, increases in interest will improve the slope by drawing closer to revenues between longer and shorter bonds.
Kathy Jones, an analyst at Schwab, said in analysis that high-income bonds usually perform better in such an environment, but "we are still careful to achieve revenue".
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets have already adapted to Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the decline in the power of dollars and inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market is being organised according to stricter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest increases, yield curves are smooth, credit spreads have expanded, and fluctuations have increased -- all the features that will be seen in the market when the FED tightens policy.
From a wide perspective, companies that do most of their work in the United States will win because interest rates will increase and local products will be more attractive.
The situation of multinational companies that owe a lot of money will be worse because the rising dollar will make products more expensive on the global market, and their debt will be even more expensive.
Goldman Sachs analysts wrote a report for his clients saying, "History shows that the 'rich' stocks can suffer from a low performance at the beginning of such an increase."
Companies with strong balance sheets passed with an average of 5 per cent, followed by an increase of 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital and low fluctuating stocks also beat low quality competitors (100 percent) with a 3 average.
Debt will become a big deal.
According to Goldman, companies with a high rate of fluctuating courtship debt are most likely to suffer.
Consumers are expected to benefit from the increased dollar, except for the Safi stock game.
Although experts have different views on how fast it will hold, savings may also benefit from high gains.
Andrew Bingham said BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham station accuses of 'insult'
He argued that radio became increasingly different from commercial competitors.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and accused him of ripping off the Brit Awards.
His surrogate friend Damien Collins accused The Voice of being unaccompanied.
A prominent deputy pressured the publisher to show his differences to other commercial stations, saying BBC Radio 3 is "transforming" to the Classic FM.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham said that the radio station, which provides public service to BBC bosses, is "inflating" and is becoming increasingly different from its business competitors.
"I don't like to use that term, but Radio 3 is getting worse, and it's turning into Classic FM."
In addition, the first one targeted the BBC Music Awards held last December.
It's like another version of the BBC Music Awards that started last year.
"So if you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples I can think of, and you're copying the same ones that are already in the market," Bingham said.
BBC Director General rejected the accusations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is clearly ahead of trade competitors in both live music and public education.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm gonna go learn something about classical music from somewhere else.
And that's a commitment to live music, and making music is nothing compared to anything else.
He also said that I think it's important that Radio 3 is trying to explore new music and promote work.
At the beginning of this year, Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, claimed that radio needed to work harder to reach more audiences than in the past, because British people were less educated in classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only component of the BBC that was caught in the ball at a meeting of the Cultural, Media and Sports Selector Committee.
Congressman Tory Damien Collins also teased O Sound -- the BBC's music talent contest, which was copyrighted for 22 million pounds from the Dutch production company Talpa Media.
Can't you see why the program makes so much noise, because it's not original, and there's nothing special about it?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which was juryled by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was "in a BBC-style manner".
He said he wished the agency would "find a hit of its own blood" before doing another entertainment programme.
However, he did not accept the idea of further production of that Sound program in the future or of spending the amount spent on licensing fees on other formats.
Is Black Friday the reason Internet sales have had the lowest increase in history in August?
In the first three months of 2015, Internet sales increased by seven percent.
Lowest growth since 2000 last month when the record started to break.
There was an explosion in Internet sales three years ago, when mobile devices started being used for shopping.
Experts say Black Friday in November could be the cause of reduction in spending.
Internet shopping has been booming for over a decade, turning the most vivid shopping streets in England into a ghost town.
After figures showing only a seven per cent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say that internet sales are increasingly showing signs of weakening.
Only five per cent increase in total spending in August compared to last year, and the lowest growth has been seen since 2000, when the record began to break.
After figures showing only a seven per cent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say Internet sales are increasingly showing signs of weakening.
"If you look at the growth levels of the previous years and especially 2000, you will actually see that everything has returned to normal in time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
Internet sales increased greatly three years ago, when consumers started using cell phones to buy products, he added.
It meant more people could shop even when they were lying on the couch.
But right now it's going horizontal, so you can see the drop.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept taken from America, is depicted as one of the reasons sales are slowing down.
Experts say consumers may be waiting for this event to take place on the last Friday (November) in order to buy something.
Last year's event destroyed many companies' websites when five times more consumers raided companies' websites to acquire cheap products than they did last year.
Experts say that Black Friday, which shows shoppers fighting over discounts, may have restrained shoppers for now.
A study published by the British Union of retailers revealed that 1 pound of every 5 pounds spent on shopping was spent on the Internet.
One third of some products, such as TV and washing machines, are now purchased at Internet stores.
In addition, over a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of luxury and fancy shopping streets.
With the Bin Laden family found guilty, Muslims are on their way to their final journey to Mecca, where they lost their lives in a crane accident.
The bodies of 29 people who died after the first funerals in Mecca were moved on the streets by Muslims
Saudi Arabia blames Saudi Binladin group for the crane accident
Health ministry reports a total of 394 wounded after the crane fell
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the bodies of 29 people who died when a crane fell into the Sacred Mosque.
The crowd, mostly in white, blocked the roads to send their first funerals to their final journey to Mecca's Muysim Cemetery.
The painful crowd passed the sacred place where a crane destroyed the ceiling of the mosque a few days ago and the pilgrims fell upon it.
In the case of 394 wounded, the bodies of the dead were brought to be buried after the Saudi Kingdom's construction conglomerate held the Binladin family responsible.
The bodies of 29 pilgrims who died when a crane crashed into the Sacred Mosque were carried on their shoulders along the way.
When the crane fell among the dead, the father of four children from Bolton, Manchester, was also Kasim Akram, who was on his first pilgrimage.
Mr. Akram came to the Sacred Mosque at the beginning of the annual pilgrimage with his parents.
Saudi leaders have announced that the pilgrimage will continue with the participation of thousands of pilgrims on their way to Mecca.
King Salman said today that Binladin Holdings should not leave the crane's arm open while it is out of service.
The Arabic version of the decree issued by the state-run Saudi Press Agency said the only party to blame for the incident was the Binladin Group.
The news agency's English service did not pass that detail, but its officials have been informed that a curfew has been issued.
At the beginning of the week, Salman vowed that they would find a reason for the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Sacred Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came to the pilgrims at the end of the month.
Binladin's group made no statement about the downed crane, and their representatives were not allowed to comment.
The royal decree accused the group of failing to take current security measures and not cooperating with meteorological officials.
The mosque in Mecca is surrounded by dozens of cranes, most of which are run by the Binladin group.
The Binladin family has been in close contact with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is the head of most construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaeda's organization, Osama Bin Laden, was a perverted son who the family disowned.
The accident occurred only a few days before millions flocked to the Hajland, where every adult Muslim was supposed to visit at least once in their lives.
Authorities have reported that 158 people are still being treated at the hospital.
Authorities have instructed the families of the deceased to pay compensation of 1 million Rials (174,000 pounds) for the survivors of a permanent injury.
The other wounded will get half that amount.
The B&Q boss says that the East European craftsmen are working cheaply behind this trend.
Veronique Laury says the British are hiring more and more masters.
Behind this increase lies the number of Eastern European craftsmen.
As a result, 200 new Screwfix stores, targeting craftsmen, are opening up.
Kingfisher also closes 60 B&Q sales point across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail Head Reporter
It is said that the British have begun hiring skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do their chores instead of dropping hammers and paintbrushes.
If you're good at hammering or painting walls, you're in the minority these days.
Because according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, the British are increasingly employing more and more experts to do DIY work in their homes.
Veronique Laury, the new director of Kingfisher, who owns the home improvement chain, said that behind this trend there was a huge increase in the number of skilled East European craftsmen offering low prices services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to close 60 B&Q and open 200 new Screwfix stores for craftsmen.
Miss Laury said she wanted more women hired at B&Q stores because eight of the ten purchases were made by women.
At the moment, most of the staff are male.
The single woman, who has done more house improvements than in the past, said the house was a need to meet emerging demographic trends.
Mrs. Laury said, "Our stores are still mostly men.
We need to balance more.
Basically, half our clients are women and 80 percent of the decisions on purchases are made by women.
Women play a big part in the decision-making process.
Miss Laury, one of the five women at the head of Britain's leading firm FTSE100, has reconstructed her staff to be equal men and women principals.
Kingfisher, including his general manager and financial manager, 50 percent of his team is almost alone in this area with a staff of women.
"It was a conscious decision -- diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women for our board.
After the group was charged with the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher announced a drop in both lower-month profits and sales.
As a result of the trend, Screwfix and B&Q owner Kingfisher will open 200 new stores
Time to decide interest increase for US Central Bank FED
The US Central Bank's two-day meetings, which continue on Wednesdays and Thursdays, are monitored by the world; a decision is expected in ten years to decide whether interest rates will be increased.
In a survey conducted by Reuters, a little more than half of 80 economists said the FED would implement this decision last week, but now they think it would suspend this decision and keep the odds between 0.25 per cent.
It's a historical event since the Fed has been down to zero and it's been seven years now.
"For the first time, we will see a large central bank come out of its zero point and begin the process of normalising interest rates," said senior researcher Angel Ubide of the Peterson International Economic Institute.
The US economy is doing a relatively good performance, adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet in the process of revitalising the economy and creating a small amount of inflation.
The Fed, however, cannot ignore the less promising global painting.
He warned the markets against an increase, but there are indications that they believe the situation will not allow such a rise.
The verdict will be announced Thursday at 8:00.
The perpetrator of the murder at Delta State University left an apology letter.
According to authorities on Tuesday, Shannon Lamb left a note Monday morning after she killed her girlfriend in Mississippi with a gun and later that day saying she was sorry for the first murder before killing her colleague, and that she had a "if I could take it back" wish.
The Mississippi Gautier police said Lamb, a geography and social studies instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10:00.
He said he said he shot and killed on Monday.
Lamb said he had to send the police to the officer on the phone.
Lamb, who said "I killed my wife last night", also stated that there was a "sweet dog who didn't hurt anyone" in the house and that he was probably upset.
The police asked his name, but he didn't say his name.
Lamb didn't explain anything about the murder.
When the police went to the scene, they found a note from the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and Lamb, 45-year-old, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy very much, and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After Lamb wrote this note, he drove his car 300 miles away to Delta State and killed the history professor Ethan Schmidt, and then killed himself when the cops cornered him.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "It's obvious that Lamb has something on his mind."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb believed his girlfriend Prentiss also had an emotional relationship with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that they did not have "any information or evidence" that there was a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for about seven years, describes Prentiss as a "good guy."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but they continued to be friends.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and a 19-year-old girl were found and that she was "down."
O'Steen also stated that Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."
According to Linsday Knowless, whom Sun Herald described as a close friend of Parentiss, he worked online from his home.
Knowles said Prentiss, a hunting dog named Lightning, had been with Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "He always liked to help others."
Police said Lamb called his relatives on Monday, saying, "I'm not going to jail."
That same night, when the police got close to him at Highway One near Greenville, Lamb pulled over, jumped on foot, ran into the woods and shot himself to death.
According to a CV published on the University website, Lamb received a PhD in education at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their old charm
The actor (left) who was seen with his son Redmond (right) for several stressful years.
He struggled with leukemia in 2001, and in 2009, he killed his life partner Farrah Fawcett.
The actor, who was said to have been fighting drugs, was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
Of course, all this has done him a lot of harm.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United has been out for months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two fractures in the match against PSV Eindhoven in Manchester United's Champions League.
The event that tears the defender's eyes off the field for at least six months leaves Louis van Gaal Shaw hopeful that he'll be back on the field again this season.
In the 15th minute of the fight, when 20-year-old Shaw dropped like a bomb on the field, it caused him to enter with Héctor Moreno without attention.
He was in the field for nine minutes and then had to be oxygenated before he was transferred to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture in his leg, and he's in the hospital."
Today or a day later, maybe he'll be transferred and operated on in Manchester.
It's a terrible situation - an 18-year-old young man who's transferred to Manchester, he's going to have a hard time, and then you're going to have a great game, and then this happens to him.
When he was in the locker room, he had an oxygen mask on his face.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have multiple fractures, that means at least six months, and that means you can't play in group.
I'm hoping he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to get away with a red card and a penalty shot.
Ref Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal claimed the Italian official made a mistake.
When I say it's a penalty and a red card, you can judge yourself.
It was a terrible fight with two legs.
The tweet on Shaw's account said, "Thank you all for your messages, it's not enough words to tell me how disappointed I've been, my way of healing begins now, and I'll come back strong."
Interested in the loss of Manchester United PSV, Luke Shaw suffers the shock of his injury.
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, will be morale for the recovery of the British defender.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a very bad injury."
If an injury like this happens to any player, everyone will be upset.
Our players never intended to maim their opponent.
Moreno also had a broken leg in the 2014 World Cup when he played for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands.
He found it very difficult because he never intended to maim his opponent, and after hearing that it was a very bad break, he said it wasn't good.
In my case, that moment was impossible to see.
All I could see was the ball going in a different direction, like Moreno touched it, but I couldn't see Luke's hustle.
SBS 6 told Moreno: "I know what it feels like. I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel really bad about this and I'm really sorry.
He was taken to the hospital after a fight with Chris Smalling in Andrés Guardado, PSV.
Of course David Cameron knows The Lorax better than that?
This is something that every parent learns very quickly: When your child loves a book, you know it won't take you long to learn it almost by heart.
Apparently, if you're not David Cameron.
When asked by a holiday programmer for child care, what was his favorite children's book, the prime minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss' 1971 environmental tale.
"I like to read this book to my children because it contains a vision or message that we've always missed in it, which is a funny, fascinating, creative and powerful message," Cameron said in his message posted on the SuperCamps company's website.
Everything was going so well until Cameron supposedly wrote something about the contents of the book, but in fact, to inflate the content of the original fairy tale text, the new character and details were added to the book's 2012 film version summed up.
In Thneed-Ville, where all nature is destroyed and even the air is meta, a boy named Ted, the girl of his dreams, wants to fulfill his desire to see a real tree to win Audrey's heart, including a love story that Dr. Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, did not know.
If that doesn't seem suspicious enough to you, in a text that Cameron discussed, it's very similar to the short summary text of The Lora film in the Internet Film Archive, which begins with: "In Thneed-Ville, the city where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a child named Ted wants to win Audrey's heart."
According to claims that Cameron is a competent parent, it is unlikely that Cameron is unaware of the mother of the book, where he hears how an anonymous young child was destroyed by the local environment, which is called Lorax, who speaks for the trees, despite the objections of the dwarf, mustached and "speaking for the trees" creature.
It's likely that such a weak PR job has been transferred to an orderly, who apparently hasn't read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A lady from the presidency said the text was thought to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron's staff, but he made no other comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk for England's extraction, but he's still intact.
Playing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a challenge, but after seeing the British team selected for the tour, I don't think it's a review of the 3-0 test series defeats that took place last time.
Still, I'm not leaving an away win out of the question.
Alastair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but they have a good spin on the batting line, and he has a strong collective sense of play; they don't heal 2012's wounds, they only provide a little youthful optimism.
In the ball game, Moeen Ali develops as a game converter, and Adil Rashid represents an attack option, even though the quality of the test level is unknown.
Related: Adam Lyth quit the British Trial Team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to remove Adam Lyth is a difficult decision for me to analyze as his chief trainer in Yorkshire.
The Seven Trials were against two good attacks under difficult circumstances, and the simple but inevitable fact is that cricketers are judged according to the outcome.
For example, there was no question about Joe Root, and the announcement had to be made because -- as I said before -- the players were their best choice.
After a few fifty-point series, Lyth might have seen his career grow, but he set his own fate.
I'm hoping if he works harder for Yorkshire, he'll get another chance.
Trevor Bayliss, England's head coach, praised the player's attitude even though he didn't perform his best, which doesn't surprise me, first of all, he's a team man.
It's hard to answer a question about how long it's gonna take for a test hitter to get a note.
Lyth -- like Sam Robson before him -- took seven caps, on the other hand, Nick Compton took nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play a rematch.
The only pain you can feel for Jonathan Trott could be that England went to the Caribbean first - while Lyth's form was at its peak - but this wasted opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and I think he's a high-level hitter.
He's an X-factor cricketer, and we saw this in Yorkshire at the beginning of this season when he scored 236 against us on the Trent Bridge field.
At least it should be taken for the same opportunity as the one before it, but it depends on the team formation of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea that Moeen had to open up next to Cook so he could get an extra game converter while holding four bucks worked, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why a batter can't shoot here, and this leftist has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen might not have done his job for the city of Worcestershire, but he saw a number three for them, and it's not much different.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tryouts in his first fall before his 2001 debut.
He grabbed three hundred straight out of the loop and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari came to the team as a backup game converter and surprised me as an impressive young man in my limited negotiations with him.
People can see raw stats -- 31 averages in the shot and 35 averages in the ball -- and they might think it's a degague, but there's not a lot of gamers raising their hands, and the casting choices are for the younger one.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the team, England seems to have made a few subtle additions to its own coaching team.
Sri Lanka striker Mahela Jayawardene's appointment as a consultant for the test games can be a master precautionary measure.
One of the loveliest men in that game is going to bring with it a lot of experience, in any case, and a lot of experience that has been achieved against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball foot of the tour and gives both energy and game formation a vicious series.
I always thought he was born for the international cricket world, whether he was an actor or a trainer, and he had a sense of guidance, such as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the locker room, even messages that have been said before, can bring the team a new look.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting for a day's play, Root's had a similar break from Australia, and I'm fine with that.
Not everyone agrees, but plans aren't made by coaches and players.
And you must remember, like the actors, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never easily taken.
Brexit could win camp if the economy is still until 2017.
David Cameron's half-baked negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse and worse every day, even though Jeremy "Yes or No" Corbyn was elected to the Labour Party leadership or the TUC went out of their minds about Europe on Tuesday.
Strangers have Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
Recently, a European diplomat told me that some member states are tired of the agenda of self-absorbed divisional concessions and disruptive treaty changes in the EU, which is completely plagued by various crises that have not been caused by them.
At his annual meeting at Brighton, TUC decided he didn't want them if he hurt social security.
In fact, we could call it Dave and George's own agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor are attending summits or bilateral meetings in the capitals of foreign countries, taking pictures of themselves in front of the famous monuments, and then returning to their country to gather allies for reform, they say.
This is all about me.
When Berlin said "Don't leave us alone with France", my friend in Europe, who wants an extroverted Britain in the EU tent, said that it has come to a point in some capitals where they are increasingly short-sighted ministers and authorities don't care if we're staying or not anymore.
Germany's cautious and sane Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, who has been in power for 10 years, and wants to leave power before the situation goes south, as in those examples of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande faces re-election in 2017 in France or a change of power.
It's a fading force.
Soon a nationalist government from the right side of Poland and a government from the left side of Spain will take power.
It's not likely for the selfie Britons that they should use their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, because they don't want it either, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning to speed up the Brexit process by making deliberate statements that won't help during the United Kingdom's 2017 referendum campaign, in the way of the Scottish National Party; that's what my friend says.
"The negotiation was not a dead end," and "Britania has achieved nothing to benefit from the re-interview."
Europeans know from their previous experience how exploitative, oligarchical press barons were EU dissidents because in Tony Benn's day, they were inspired by the 1975 referendum, which approved our entry of 2 to 1 in 1973.
This is how they remember Boris Johnson, the head Euro-portunist, who was a Brussels correspondent in the early '90s, who announced his name as "EU flat bananas".
All his foolishness aside, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
Among them were the anti-tax bums, the foreigners listening to illegal phone calls, and the so-called foreign residents who had most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair, on the other hand, felt the same way about them, but when he was trapped in a cage with a horny gorilla, he realized that he had to distract him by giving him a banana for lunch and teatime, so that he wouldn't be bait.
In fact, Miliband was Blairci to argue against Cameron's brilliant idea of a referendum, as Blair compromised the principle of the EU constitution, which was cancelled in 2005 by French and Dutch voters who gave her an exit card.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, who I told him that he had no more time to lose at Westminster on Monday, seems to be in danger of reinstating Murdoch's boycott strategy in the '80s, which is now a mistake.
Although it will take time, he needs to develop a consistent strategy to communicate with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC on Sunday, especially with the media, and not with me.
I hereby declare Corbyn's official position in Europe to be developing.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of the people who are left out of Ukip's hostile tendencies and the fierce supporters of Conservative Little England say yes.
That's what Hilary Benn, who was already a Benn but not a Bennite, said on the radio and on TV this week, because she was naive enough to force herself not to accept that it was a bad idea for Corbyn to appoint John McDonnell as the shadow chancellor.
It reminded me that in the '70s, his father lost his struggle with infidelity to his colleagues in the TV cabinet, his failure to go too far, and his position in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But to fight for Benn's testimony -- to stay "under any circumstances" -- was not the same thing McDonnell said at the special meeting of the JC on Monday night that he told the lords what he said to the MPs.
Given the fact that he touched me, from the detail that Corbyn is trying to convey, general, whatever the confused image is, he's in the age of 24/7 TV and, in particular, in the midst of social media discipline, which is a bed of paranoia and betrayal, the message remains important.
As McDonnell said, it's reasonable to give Cameron a hard time with Europe, which guarantees the Labour Party's support in the referendum.
That's exactly what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But the fact that McDonnell and Corbyn are moving in line with the Bennite siege economy and anti-capitalist backgrounds on EU membership is no longer a matter of discussion between left-wing opponents, whose teaching narcissism is the cornerstones of the teaching narcissism.
Tom Watson, determined that JC will not campaign to leave, as he did about Nato -- foreign diplomats will have to try to make a point of it for their master in their country.
Why would Paris or Berlin lose political capital on Britain's concessions, where all of them could have failed, when they themselves had suspicious voters?
As I was told at the opening of the British Power Safety Forum on Monday, the United States is already very disappointed by the British's weak minimum performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the ruling government of the Conservative Party.
Experts criticise British public health e-smoking research
Researchers said e-sigares are 95% less harmful than smoking at a 12-member meeting organised by a government-funded agency.
Experts in the British Journal of Medicine (BMJ) attended Lancet in criticising the evidence that British Public Health (PHE) used in its report on e-siggara.
PHE released its report last month on the "turn point" he described as "extensive examination of the evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the integrity of the data and pointed out links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month's editorial of the Lancet Journal of Medicine targeted the "extraordinaryly rotten foundation" based on PHE's main result.
Two other researchers at BMJ questioned whether the allegations "were built on the sand or on the rock".
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "The basic principle of public health rests on the evidence of activities of policies."
They said the public expects PHE's allegations that "the current is nearly 95% less harmful than smoking e-smoking" will be based on a detailed study of evidence and modeling.
In fact, the results of this meeting were summed up in a research article in a research article, where a multi-quitted decision analysis (MCDA) was gathered to develop a model to create a synthesis of their views on the damages to various products containing nicotine.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which had previously received funds from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also approved the BAT's public health promotion document in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funds from an e-sygara manufacturer, but they added that this was not the funds previously reported by the Philip Morris International cigarette company.
There was no information on how panel members were selected, but some of them included some known giants in the e-sygara that some reported industry funds in the article.
Others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco manager attended the meeting at PHE.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the group's research article "conceivedly" is a lack of concrete evidence of the damages of most products, according to many criteria.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said the allegations are too early that there is "no evidence that e-smoking is a pass for children or non-smoking persons".
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and welfare at PHE, said the allegations at BMJ had already been answered.
He said, "E cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two people with a lifetime of smokers dies from this addiction.
All the evidence points to a small amount of health risks caused by e-cigarage, but we need to keep looking at the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty: to inform the public of what evidence shows and does not show at a very confusing time when compared with tobacco, especially when compared with tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die a year from a cigarette-related disease, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
We do our national responsibility by making it clear that present evidence -- although e-cigarage is not risk-free -- is only carrying out a fraction of the damage caused by smoking.
Former Channel 4 chief said the BBC should leave EastEnders.
Former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop publishing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and that advertisers could "give up their right arms" for hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used to make programs that are not made by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes like BBC4, which are likely to be monitored by a smaller audience, against the highest ratings of its competitors at precious intervals.
After the BBC director Tony Hall said the institution wanted to co-operate more with other organisations; Johnson said it had failed for six years in its time on Channel 4 to establish a link with the BBC.
"I am struggling with the idea that BBC will order and publish programs that can be clearly shown by non-subsidised competitors," Johnson told the House of Lords committee during an interrogation of the BBC's future.
If you continue to apply a license fee that I'm not sure is a good idea in the middle or long term, the output should be reduced to at least programs that others don't or order.
He's broadcasting The Voice in the primate range because they want to provide as much support for the future as possible.
The idea here is based on the idea that no one else is going to publish it, which is ridiculous and frankly ridiculous.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why programs that can be funded without help should be funded by a reduced tax.
The Voice is one EastEnders is another, and it's actually being done within the company.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for that.
I'm trying to see what public service broadcasts are like.
I don't think that's going to diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series of entrepreneurs who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings "because of the passion of the people who work here and because they see this approach as the best way to ensure long-term support".
Comments on BBC's most popular programmes echo comments by former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used the MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell programs like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's more appropriate public service programmes went to BBC4 and could not be made to measure viewers here, but that they were paying tax amnesty and that they could argue about the grounds for 4 billion pounds of licensing, and that they could continue their showy duty of piety. He added: "Of course, we are doing all these silent programs that no one has ever seen."
They put them in spaces where no one will ever see them.
About the license fee, Johnson told the committee, "I would like to invite you to find a more regressive system for those who benefit from it.
Of course you're all thinking, we're all thinking, 150 pounds a year is a big deal, but I'm wondering if it's because they don't watch too much BBC for people who are worth 150 pounds a year.
At the same time, David Elstein, former Sky and Channel 5 executive who presented evidence to the committee Tuesday, said the BBC should revise the Reithian mission "to inform, educate and entertain".
He said that some of the BBC's exit is now officially classified as education -- it's one percent of the TV output and 0.1% of the radio -- and that public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should be the front step and that should be changed to "information, lighting and training".
In terms of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC needs to engage with advertising publishers to do something about proms that are only a handful of them shown on TV and make sure they're all monitored online.
'Sonogenetic' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves.
The video shows how the threadworms changed direction when they were hit by sound vibrations.
Scientists have raised worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by soundwave bursts.
Tiny threadworms change direction as soon as they're hit by sound vibrations in a high-pitched high-rise that people can't hear.
The vibrations are activated by activating genetically modified motor nerve cells to carry membrane conduits that respond to infrasound waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers say that worms prove the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, so an ultrasound can be used to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells from the outside of the body.
From Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, researcher Sreekanth Chalasani told Guardian that this procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, a procedure that gives people electrical vibrations inside their brain to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms.
Wireworms often don't respond beyond sound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles, they reacted.
The bubbles it finds strengthen the transsound waves and allow them to pass through the maggots.
Reinforced trans-soundal waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion conduits found in the membranes of some maggot cells.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves enable these ion conduits to open and activate the cells they are connected to.
To create threadworms controlled by infrasound, Chalasani genetically altered maggots to allow some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applied infrasound to modified creatures, the sound waves were powered by micro-cabes and transmitted into maggots and activated motor neurons that were modified here.
This procedure is similar to the optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to activate and shut down neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike the light that should be sent through an optical fiber in the brain to the desired point, low-frequency trans-sound waves can pass through the tissue without obstruction, so that they can be sent through the skull into the brain.
Chalasani said, "We believe that human neurons targeted in a clinical setting by using gene therapy and a treatative virus can be temporarily sensitive to the transsound signal."
Other applications can focus on muscle cells and insulin-reproduction cells, he added.

Advertising condemns England's arms trade
Watch the Amnesty International anti-arms video.
Terrible killer drones!
The shackles that broke your ankle!
Particle bombs!
And electric shocksticks that cause severe pain but leave no trace!
The fine audio and cartoon images, designed to highlight the British government's desire to sell weapons to oppressive regimes through the International Defence and Security equipment at the ExCel Centre at the London Pier for Amnesty International, leave no doubt that the world's largest weapons fair is a sharp hoax.

However, a different campaign continues with bus stops and posters on subway trains and requires a double look.
At one point, using London Metro fonts and brands to turn the DLR line into a tank, he says, "The important announcement is, will you travel at DLR between September 15th and September 18th?"
This September, a pack of arms dealers is going to attack the DLR... and customers are being asked to help stop this arms fair.
300 posters from artists who exhibit at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Bansky's Dismaland.
A collective, called the Special Patrol Group, helped distribute it using the "Ratting Packages", which was £6 and claimed to have "enabled access to about a third of the advertising sites on the planet".
Transportation for London wasn't happy with the "vandalism" of this poster.
One of the ads was created by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, the curator of Cruel Designs and professor of Essex University, artists are becoming more and more interrogative, and they're looking for ways to move political work to the masses outside the gallery.
Many artists act with activists in their protest movement and begin to realize that their art has to come out into the real world to have an impact on society.
Another anti-weapons trade poster also faces travelers on the subway.
The Amnesty International video was monitored more than 100,000 times over Facebook in 24 hours and created by a free VCP advertising agency, and graphic designer and audio artist produced it for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was surprised by the silence of the gun fair commercials -- with space in the ExCel calendar -- and he thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to run away from."
They played with the idea of doing a more realistic, subtle corporate ad, but they decorated it with bright colors and animation, and it became more remarkable.
Tom Davies of Amnesty said, "They have been very helpful in creating concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair."
What we need now is for the British government to act and prevent torture equipment from being sold illegally on our doorstep.
Maybe the most creative art at the gun show comes from the ExCEL inside, where exhibitors sell fantastic cover-up products.
In a press release, Saab showed the US military's order "At4CS RS", launched from our shoulder.

Eight golden rules of student housing
It's been 11 years since I've moved into student dorms at the age of 19, and I still believe in bruises and moral relativity, but now I remember the fake smiles of those I've disturbed -- and their complaints about others of countless lengths.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled by eight golden rules.
Moving home can be traced from annoying to absolutely terrifying.
The temptation of small talk: where people are from, where they haven't lost years, where you insist on Corbyn, and why you obviously don't like Marmite or hate Marmite, because really, gentlemen, she'll only be in my room with the yeast extract HAHAHAH."

And let the others have one - ask questions and show interest.
He's going to direct this conversation, and if your eyelashes are on fire, and they're putting out fire extinguishers, he's going to help you separate what you like from the people you don't talk to.
Leave some space for the people.
People's rooms often turn into liquor receptions, movie night places, and community hangouts, but they're also places where people dress and arrange their underwear.
Related: Do not even think about starting college with a relationship
Introverts are treated badly in college.
Your room may be a retreat, but many dorm hallways develop inter-room hang culture, and it's friendly, social and lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who's trying to store energy.
Nothing in culture will allow you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away for a while so that I can restore the energy I've spent communicating with you."
Try to sense that a friend is tired of socializing and maybe instead of knocking, you can text him.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A friend at the student dorm, if the door wasn't locked, he got the same policy he was invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Don't make friends through cooking.
Since you started college at the height of the cooking contest madness, it's less awkward and less 1950s to introduce yourself by knocking on people's doors with a plate of brownies, and it's "Welcome to our neighborhood, I've cooked something for you, now smile while I'm asking you personal questions."
Giving people homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel compelled to talk, maybe they'll connect your face to a pleasant surprise.
Honestly, this is about you being a master cook.
A lump of lumped dough, sugar and oil that isn't well mixed will make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
To be honest, scratching someone's chicken is stealing, but buying a few drops of milk for your tea is stealing?
Double-check the milkman.
He'll probably tell you to take care of yourself, even if he's swimming in it.
It's very uncomfortable and I understand that someone is stealing your stuff -- but try to deal with it more maturely than my dorm mate, who put liquid soap in to punish whoever stole your milk.
He's in jail now.
Do not make noise that prevents people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent person, but because you're people in glass houses.
A girl in my hallway told her neighbor next door to step down the drums a little bit because it's 3:00 in the morning and she's taking her morning exam.
The answers were to make the sound louder.
When they finally closed at 5:00 a.m., she gently opened her own music and locked the door, allowing them to sleep for two hours before going to their three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife moved into the same hallway as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be strange if you misunderstood a fellow hallie and thought you had a future wife and hung out and left and had to see her every day and watched her be taken captive by your mutual friends?
Of course it's heart, but if your hot hallway neighbor is definitely not your future wife, at least talk to the kid and advise him on common sense.
When you realize in a cheerful moment that someone left their keys unlocked, you know that the line between a joke and a persecution is thinner than you think.
A good joke is fun, but it'll take time to get back.
You can teach someone a valuable and fun lesson in security by hiding their stuff-- but never soil someone's room with shampoo and toothpaste.

Oil companies are officially down.
About $400 billion of investment has been postponed from 2014, when oil prices began to drop, while most of the deep sea (deepwater) oil exploration projects have been suspended.
According to the research of advisory company Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices have led to a suspension of $380 billion in oil and gas exploration/reduction, while millions of barrels of production have been postponed in large geography from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa.
The main reason for cost cuts is that in the summer of 2014, it lost 70 per cent in a year and a year and a half and showed the lowest price of oil in 12 years, while the company budgets were dramatically reduced.
400 MILLION DOLLARS IN THE SKIDA
Raw oil prices have been making new surprises every day, and lastly, they have been reduced to less than $30, seeing the lowest level in the past 12 years.
The research published by energy consulting company Wood Mackenzie shows how the industry is affected by lower prices.
Lastly, in his July report, Wood Mackenzie shows that the falling oil prices led to the suspension of 46 major energy investments of $200 billion, revealing where that number reached until the end of 2015.
According to this, 22 major projects have been postponed in the last six months of 2015, while 68 major projects have been suspended since 2014, when the oil collapse began.
These projects are worth about $400 billion.
DAY 2.9 MILLION
Stressing that low oil prices affect company plans are "unforgiving", research noted that the most affected projects are deep-sea development projects.
Projects suspended totalling 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent reserves, with 2.9 million barrels of oil per day delayed until 2025.
According to the study, most of the projects' final investment decision was postponed until 2017 and later, while their first production objectives ranged from 2020 to 2023.
"The majority of 170 billion dollars is deep-sea projects," the report stressed, emphasising the potential investment of 170 billion in the next five years.
That's because the initial investment cost is too high.
"70 per cent of deep sea spending is initially created by oil-weight projects in Nigeria, Angola and the United States' Gulf of Mexico," they say.
According to the study, Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States have the most delayed oil project inventory.
These six countries have nearly 90 per cent of the delayed liquid reserves.
Together, Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia have the largest amount of suspended gas reserves.
Most of the gas waiting to leave here is in the deep sea, with complex and expensive development solutions such as building a zero - liquidized gas (LNG) facility.
The most endangered companies are oil giants in the deep sea, Canadian oil sand and the Caspian region, while companies are also trying to adapt to the "longer" oil prices scenario.
THE EYES ARE IN IRAN
About four years ago, there was a painting: the United States and Europe brought embargo to Iranian oil to stop Tehran's nuclear programme, the price of oil was about $110, and how Iranian oil exports would be trapped without a sudden jump in prices.
And when we get back this week, we're seeing a whole new scenario.
Oil prices have seen under $30 for the first time since 2004, and mainly because of the U.S. production explosion, and embargos against Iran are lifted.
That's why we have eyes on Iran.
If Iran increases oil exports, more oil will flow to the oil market, which is already said to be quite saturated.
That could also lead to lower prices than the levels that surprised us today.
Some analysts say Saudi Arabia, which does not want to lose a market share to Iran, will pump more oil and could have a price war between Iran and S. Arabia.
As soon as the sanctions are up, Iran's main target is recorded as the rapidly growing oil market of Asia, former partners in India and Europe.
Iranian officials earlier said they aim to increase exports by 500,000 barrels per day in the first place and then release another amount after a while.
According to Reuters's map data, 22 very large crude oil carriers (VLCC) are on the coast of Iran, while at least 13 of them are fully or largely loaded.
Iran has the fourth largest proven oil reserves in the world.
With the exceptions of sanctions, Iran is still exporting about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries, including Turkey.
Prior to the sanctions, Iran's daily oil exports were up to 3 million barrels a day.
Support Securities Research Expert Aysun Göksu answers the question if oil drops below $20. "Chinese-based global growth concerns increase the low-level pressure on commodity prices, while the loss of oil prices deepens."
In China, the world's largest oil importer, we see that oil has reached 20 percent since New Year's, with concerns that the demand for oil will be reduced in parallel to economic slowdown.
In addition, with the dollar gaining global value and the impact of the global supply surplus problem, we can see prices of less than $30 in oil in the coming days.
As long as we don't see permanent pricing on the 32-33 dollar level, the rise in oil may be limited and the downward pressure may increase.
At this point, closings under a critical 30 dollar level can be said to have a key role to ensure the decline continues.
It shouldn't be a surprise that there's a lot of relaxation going on at the bottom of the 23.30 to 25.60 support zone.

Meanwhile, I've been consulting Koton for the last two years.
And then I saw the potential in this geography and the Koton brand.
I realized that you had everything you needed to be a world-aged chain of stores.
Now I'm here to make it happen.
Will you be able to make it soon?
- Absolutely.
Even though it's a young brand, it's already sold in 50 countries.
We do 50 collections a year, 15 separate sections.
So there's everything a chain of stores should have.
From Dubai to Moscow, we are able to respond to the needs of consumers in different geography.
Now we're opening a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting era.
Is it necessary to open a store in Paris?
- Yeah.
It's not because Europe's economic situation is great.
But you open some stores for image.
In fashion capitals like Paris, London, you get a store, you get money from the Middle East.
One puts prestige in the brand, the other puts money in it, both essential for a brand that plays global.
So let's talk trends...
- We have a very romantic, elegant season ahead.
Flying chiffon suits, soft tones, pinks, whites, reds.
Patterns...
We're going through a very difficult and brutal time, and the fashion world is always trying to bring a little bit of happiness to life in these difficult times by bringing elegant, refreshing designs to the podium.
That's what we're doing.
That's why the season is coming back.
Let's go back to your years at Victoria's Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel?
I'm not just talking about your awesome physique, she's so positive, she's so good!
He used to sit next to me while I was working and feed me apples and stuff, "Honey, are you hungry?"
That's how sweet he was.
You know what I'm talking about, I looked into it, and you interviewed all the Victoria's Secret models.
Isn't Karolina beautiful?
But Adriana Lima also impressed me with her beauty.
- Say yes, that voice!
That speech, that tone...
You get nervous after a while, and you say, "Sit aside and look nice, and don't do anything else!"
It brings nerves.
That's right, shocks like this happen.
I interviewed Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen, but I was terrified of her vanity.
- Most of them are now.
New angels aren't what they used to be...
I remember when Gisele was...
Although working with him was difficult.
He came backstage, smoked like a chimney.
Not that you're a smoker.
No one can drink, he's the only one who can!
It's about being a diva.
The Victoria's Secret show, published two months ago, received the lowest ratings in its history.
Why do you think?
- Like I said, it's over with those legendary angels.
I'm sorry, but who needs Gigi Hadid?
What's so good about it?
Kendall Jenner, like wood.
No curves, nothing.
Kate Moss has zero curves, but she's become the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but her face was so pretty.
I'd like to exercise my right to protest here.
I interviewed him last year, and his face was pretty messed up...
- All this smoking, drinking, now it's ugly.
But in the '90s, she had such a beautiful face.
His lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
He had reached the end of the supermodel era.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington.
Christy was my next-door neighbor, and I saw her with no makeup on every morning.
Such beauty can't be such grace.
What about Cara Devewingne?
- He's wasting himself.
It's not every campaign.
People are getting tired of it.
There's no hunger for famous models, Celebritys, as it used to be.
People like themselves want to see real faces in campaigns.
That's what we're gonna do.
Because that's the trend.
Letters from Turkey from 25 authors
According to BBC Turkish, writers including the presidents of the International Union of Writers (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland said that threats and physical attacks targeting their colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey have become a common part of life.
The letter included two attacks targeting the daily Hurriyet in Turkey, the Koza group raid, and the detention of Vice News correspondents, including investigations and arrests against journalists.
Mother's half-working rights raised controversy
"We believe that mothers have been given half the right to work so that the employment of rent can be brought back."
"This could be a Trojan horse," TİSK said, "we're concerned if this arrangement will stop women from working."
New rights planned for workers and workers after birth or adoption have been passed through the commission in talks all day.
Part-time work after birth or free leave, and the most common issue of arrangements that allowed child to work part-time until he reached primary school is "rental labour" during commission talks.
Speaking that it is correct to have partial work done by the time the child gets to elementary school, CHP İzmir MP Musa Çam said that they had some concerns. "If you bring the contract work arrangement after this, we will be against you until the end."
Enis Bağdadioglu, who attended the commission talks on behalf of Turkey-Eş, expressed similar concerns, while saying, "We have doubts about how to replace the female employee in half-time work".
"That is why we will watch with concern about developments regarding private employment offices," he said, adding that new issues will be raised that would be far beyond subcontractive work if rental labor comes up again on this occasion.
TİSK Secretary-General Bulent Pirler said that partial work was brought in by the law for five years, while "This long partial work is not available in other countries."
Look at it this way.
"In places with 1 or 2 employees, you have to think about the consequences of this practice," he said.
ToBB Counselor Ahmet Shakar said he would have trouble finding workers if the application passed through life.
"A compromise should be reached between workers and employers who have made arrangements for private employment offices," Şararar said, adding that there are no regulations regarding rules to be implemented in part-time work.
Metin Feyzioğlu: We do not support
"We do not participate in this statement, we cannot participate and support it," Feyzioglu said.
Because there's no one-word criticism of the PKK.
You couldn't say a word negative to the PKK, to the separatist terrorist organization, and you didn't put dust on it.
We just don't consider the harsh statements against the government and we don't consider them serious, and we don't find them sincere.
We're lawyers, we're lawyers.
If there's anything illegal about the government's representatives, public servants, security forces, we'll follow it.
When we say, "Don't tear down the state," they attack us as "Disruptor, fascist."
When we say, "This state must act in accordance with the law, always uphold the law," they say, "You are divisive."
We're the bridge.
We're always obliged to tell the truth.

Who is Bergen?
He was born in Mersin on 16 July 1960.
With the divorce of his parents, he settled in Ankara in 1966 with his mother, Sebahat Çakır.
After Yenimahalle Yunus Emre Elementary, he entered the Ankara State Conservatory Piano Department, but he left due to financial difficulties and worked at PTT for some time.
He accepted his offer to work at the Feynman Night Club in 1979, where he went to have fun with his friends.
At the Feyman Night Club, he performed with the Group Locomotive orchestra with repertoires of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and then-fashion Arags.
After Ankara, Bergen went to Adana for work, where he met Halis Serbes and married him a year later.
In 1982, he released the first longplain from Atlas Records, "I have a complaint".
Bergen, who couldn't stand the violence of her husband, ran away from his wife many times while his debut in art continued.
In October 1982, when she was working in Izmir, she was subjected by her husband's will.
In this attack, Bergen, who lost one eye and burned a large part of the body, was convinced and performed by Cengiz Özekekekeker, the composer of the song "Who Knows?", which made Tuliya famous after treatment.
The artist, who was performing at the Izmir Diamond Pavilion, owned by Ozeker, until 1985, produced a demo tape with his boss called "Sister Destiny" and sent it to Yasar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist, who released the first professional Longplay in Istanbul's music market, "Human Lover" as Burhan Bayar's musical director, became famous for her "Woman of Pain" in late 1986.
In April 1987, the album was awarded the Golden Record and Golden Record by the record label, entitled "The Most Sold Arabesque Artist".
In the same year, Ulku Erakalın's screenplay and directorial film "The Woman of Pain" appeared on camera with Yalçın Gülhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron.
Bergen, a big fan, survived a knife attack in Adana, where he went for a concert.
At one point, the artist who left the scene, the great masters Selami Şahin, Autonomous Senay and Genghis Tekin, released their albums, "Burn Him, Lord", "The Price of Love" and "I Don't Want", respectively.
Bergen, who officially divorced her husband in April 1989, returned to the stage in June 1989 with his last surviving album, "Years Unforgiving".
He was shot to death by his wife, who divorced him on August 14, 1989, the night of August 15th.
He was buried in his hometown of Mersin.
Bergen included a video film with 5 longplays and 129 songs on 11 tapes for 29 years of short life.
The allegations that the artist who signed his different and powerful voice had become legendary have been true since the first day of his death, the album "My Gone Youth" was exhausted.
Bergen's official studio albums:
1982 - I have a complaint LP (Reprinted MC in 1986)
In 1983 – Brother Destiny was reprinted as LP (1985 and 1990 as MC).
1985 - Human Love LP was reprinted as a CD in MC (1999).
1986 - Female of Pain LP, MC (Reprinted as CD in 1999).
1987 - Burn Him, Lord LP, MC (Reprinted CD in 1999).

1990 - My Outgoing Youth was reprinted as a CD in MC (1999).
In 1990 – The Ender MC in the Tomb was reprinted as a CD in 1999.

Nazim Hikmet was remembered on his 114th birthday
In the 114th year of his birth, Nazim Hikmet Ran, known as the country's poet, was called the "Happy Birthday Nazim" event.
The event, organised by the Konak Municipality, took place in the hall in which the poet was named at the Cultural Centre in Bücelia.
At the event, poetry and music were played by the famous poet's poems, theatre and film actor Rushtu Asian.
The event was also accompanied by comments from the three Anatolian Music Society.
Nazim Hikmet accompanied many art lovers.
These include Ali Elekkiner Recipient, Erkoç Torun, Nedim Star and Zeynep Gönnur Star and Ziya Özsökmen.
In Istanbul, the event was organised by the Nazim Hikmet Culture and Art Foundation.
Foundation President Rutkay Aziz and members met in Tarabya for the event, the daughter, son-in-law and grandson of Nazim Hikmet's wife, Vera Tulykova.
"Live as one and free as a tree / and as a forest as a brother", he reads poems and leaves carnations in the sea.
The event, organised by Sarıyer Municipality, will be accompanied by songs by the Songs of the Nazim Hikmet Choir.
Nazim Hikmet was born on January 15, 1902.
The poems of the world-famous poet Nazim Hikmet were translated into more than 50 languages.
He has been arrested repeatedly for his political beliefs and has spent most of his adult life in prison or exile.
His poems were translated into over 50 languages and his work received many awards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
The City of Bursa Lotus did special work on the 114th birthday of the world-famous poet Nazim Hikmet.
The municipality also produced its first personal stamp for the poet for the first time in Turkey's history for the documentary on Nazim's 11-year history at Bursa Prison.
Thus, PTT co-operated with the first personal stamp in Turkey's history on behalf of Nazim Hikmet.
This special stamp, which costs $1.40, and first-day envelopes will be presented to guests on Thursday (January 14th) at the Nazim Hikmet Cultural House.
They'll be deported by bicycle.
However, refugees, who are mostly Syrians, will have to go back to Russia, pedaling at minus 20 degrees this time, as the two countries have been unable to reach an agreement.
In the summer months, a group of refugees flew to Russia, moving north of the country from Murmansk to Norway, saying it was safer and cheaper.
Since the agreement between the two countries did not allow them to cross the border on foot, immigrants crossed the border by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
Therefore, the Norwegian police ordered the repair of abandoned bicycles across the border.
EU crisis "3 billion euros for Turkey"
The crisis over 3 billion euros promised to Turkey for refugees continues.
European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker criticised Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's obstruction of funds to Turkey.
The mood between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good, Juncker said, stressing that the EU must find 3 billion euros.
"This money is not for Turkey, but for Syrian refugees in Turkey."
We haven't reached 3 billion yet.
"This is a matter of EU credibility, which is why it is important," he said.
Juncker said he expects the money to be completed by the previous date, January 26th.
Italy is among the countries with a positive attitude when it comes to Turkey.
Diplomatic sources say Rome's position on the financial package is not directly aimed at Turkey, and is linked to the problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some of the Union countries.
There has been tension between Italy and the EU for some time now.
Renzi continued to harshly criticize German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EU at the last EU summit on energy, banking and immigrants.
"Renzi must stop blaming the EU."
"Renzi's, which I love very much, is wrong to insult the EU Commission at every opportunity," he said.
Juncker hinted that Renzi was playing for the public.
The EU budget will cover 1 billion of the 3 billion euros promised to Turkey.
2 billion euros will come from the budgets of member states.
Germany will contribute at least 427m euros.
The Greek Administration, which said it would not transfer money to Turkey for political reasons, has agreed to transfer its share of 2.3m euros to the EU budget to be used to support Jordan and Lebanon.
The source is expected to be used in 2016-2017.
When I saw the Charlie Hebdo cartoon, I cried.
The father, Abdullah Kurdi, who spoke to Russian official news agency Sputnik, reacted strongly and said, "I cried for this cartoon, if you will."
He said, "I felt terrible."
Following the shooting, the French satire magazine, which became a symbol of freedom of expression, expressed that they expect positive things from Charlie Hebdo, said the father Kurdi:
Unfortunately, they made a bad cartoon.
Everyone's really upset about this cartoon.
Aylan is a 2-year-old and he's dead.
Charlie Hebdo was supposed to respect Aylan, me and my family, but it was the opposite.
This magazine has to respect people.
They published a disrespectful cartoon about our Prophet.
They even published literature on God.
It's a small thing to do to my child in the presence of God and the Prophet.
The Kurdi who lived in Erbil called: "My call to the world and to comic magazine is to respect all children who have died."
It shouldn't upset their families, it shouldn't add pain to their pain.
Aylan Kurdi's aunt in Canada, Tima Kurdi, was also a cartoonist.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau, in the autographed cartoon, hints that three-year-old Syrian Aylan Kurdi, who struck his dead body on the basement shore, might have been one of the harassers in Germany when he grew up.
Last year, the French comic magazine Charlie Hebdo, who was attacked by religious extremists killing 12 people on the grounds that Muhammad published cartoons, was again the focus of controversy over his cartoon about Aylan Kurdi.
The cartoon depicted abusers with pig faces and emigrants who chased women, as did women during their Christmas celebrations in Cologne, Germany.
The cartoon that causes different reactions on social media is actually part of a four-square column.
It says "France is not this," and according to many readings, the growing refugee hostility is being criticised along with the other values lost in France.
The cartoon, on the other hand, has still led many people to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
Charlie Hebdo also praised Germany, which agreed to receive 800,000 refugees in a issue published last year, while criticising France's unwillingness to open its doors to immigrants.
The cartoon said, "He was too close to his goal." The ad said, "Two children's menus for one price."
'The autopsy on the Germans who died in Sultanahmet is in Germany'
Germany's Federal Prosecutor's Office has decided to bring the body of 10 people who lost their lives in the attack to Germany, according to the weekly magazine Der Spiegel website.
The funerals of the deceased will be held in a German Air Force plane today or tomorrow at the country and at the airport.
Experts from the Federal Criminal Bureau (BKA) who conduct forensic procedures in Germany go to countries where the incident occurred for German citizens who died in accidents or attacks under normal circumstances, where they identify and perform their autopsy.
However, Der Spiegel magazine wrote that the situation would be different this time.
According to the magazine, officials at the Federal Criminal Office have appealed to Turkish authorities to identify the dead and perform the autopsy in Istanbul, but Turkish authorities have refused to accept this proposal.
The Federal Criminal Agency sent four experts to Istanbul following the attack on Istanbul.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are being treated at the hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood is dead.
Meiksins Wood, a well-known political theorist and socialist historian, was particularly noted for his important work on the origins of capitalism.
Born in New York City in 1942, Meiksins Wood also published in Turkish: Escape from Class -- the Arkic Culture of Capitalism -- Capitalism Against Democracy -- Capitalism -- The Origin of Capitalism -- the Capital Empire -- Return to Marx.
Asylum seekers' swimming pool ban
The municipality will lift its ban if the message of the curfew is reported by asylum seekers, the German media reported.
The city's social office official Markus Schnapka, who told WDR that several people did not want to punish the innocent for their behavior, said they had informed the residents of the dorms in three languages about the values that were important in Germany.
The municipality will punish all kinds of attacks and harassment, Schnapka said, noting that they are not discussing the value of gender equality that Germany values.
Meanwhile, the carnival parade in Rheinberg has been cancelled due to the possibility that harassment scandals in Cologne will take place at the upcoming carnival parades.
The municipality has announced that the carnival parade has been cancelled because there is no guarantee of harassment.
What are the benefits of steaming?
The steam cooking technique, a technique that doesn't kill vitamins and minerals in nutrients, is becoming increasingly popular.
For centuries, steaming, one of the most popular cooking techniques in the Far East, makes metabolism stronger and easier to digest.
This way, such as indigestion, the bacteria and microbes found in nutrients die completely.
The protein in the food, cellulose and starch, are completely melting with this technique, which makes the food softer.
A low-pressure steam cooker is performed in a pot with the help of steam pots or steam engine.
In high pressure, the amount of water used in cooking and the amount of cooking is short.
The best example can be shown is cooking in a pressure cooker.
To cook foods like vegetables, especially on diet menus, first you have to wash them thoroughly and then you have to put them in a filter and wait for them to glide.
A deep pot is filled with water by a third of the water and the steam filter is placed inside the pot.
The pot is left with its mouth half closed.
So the steam is easy to get out of the pot.
First, the heat of the stove is made to boil by the highest level, and then the temperature of the furnace is made to get a lower temperature.
Some 10 to 15 minutes of steam, vegetables and nutrients are controlled by forks after they are well cooked.
The cooked vegetables are taken from the stove and served on plates.
In the steaming technique, the appearance, color, and smell of food remain unchanged, so this method is healthy.
Food has its own flavor.
The quality and flavor of the food will be intact.
At the same time, steam cooking is one of the most economic cooking methods, and food loss is kept to a minimum.
Steamed vegetables also provide a satisfying feast for those who eat with their fresher, more lively appearance.
This is especially popular in dietary food, and it is often preferred because it is light.
David Bowie - Blackstar: Alien's "last" album
Knowing that you're going to die, making that last album without telling anyone, making the death bed an artistic expression in your video.
Things like this may seem too "fly" for us mortals of the world.
I'm talking about mortals from Earth because I'm deeply convinced that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He came to our world from another corner of the universe, and now he's back home, and that's what happened.
It came because there was inspiration to be given not only to Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga, but to all the artists of the world.
He's completed his mission.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: $9.99.5/5.
He probably fed off Warhol, Kubrick, from the same planet as him.
Apollo 11, when he landed on the moon, he decided, "Is that something? I'm an alien?" And he intervened by saying "Space Oddity."
He didn't really get involved; he always took a few steps ahead.
A lot of people have found ways to lose because of him.
He's a musician and a listener.
And it's not fair to say "It was just music" for her music, aside from her interest in plastic arts and acting and all that.
From song to song, and the characters that he created himself, his references, innovation, his tabudevirence, and his discography represent an artistic integrity to me.
I can't remember him as the ancestor of glam rock or punk's cousin...
If I do, what will happen to those avant-garde electronic movements, the jazz he's been hiding in since he was a child?
David Bowie kept reminding us what the word meant until those years when we were chewing the word "Icon" into our mouths.
It wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman, it wasn't a man.
It was a body.
He appeared to us for a while because of a mission.
That body left this world two days after its 26th studio album, "Blackstar".
Before the album was released, he tried to train us to go with Blackstar and "Lazarus".
We were thinking, "He's old, he's talking about death or something." He knew everything.
One more game...
The album was released long before, except for the great Blackstar and "Lazarus", which carried the message and emotion burden of the album, but it was redacted for this album, so we could say that the number of songs we knew together with "Sue (Or In A Season of Crime)", "Tis A Pity She Was A Whore" was four.
The rest of you, I mean, "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Alive Away" and "Dollar Days" are really good songs.
It's all based on a very powerful musical structure, but it's as sincere as a momentary feeling, "Blackstar"...
There's no death, no "retaliation with the past" album...
It's just a real "last" album.
It's the "The End" of a music life that's a masterpiece from start to finish.
Turkey targeted in Sultanahmet attack
German Federal Police Office President Holger Münch made statements Tuesday about the attack on Sultanahmet Square, which killed 10 German citizens.
Münch said Turkey is the target of the attack, not German citizens.
"400 PEOPLE IN VIOLENCE"
But the Sultanahmet attack did not change the threat of terrorism in Germany, Münch said, "We are still under a threat that needs to be taken seriously."
The number of people who went to Syria to join ISIS from Germany has been reduced, Münch said, noting that many have returned from the war zones.
"There are nearly 400 dangerous people we shouldn't be keeping in custody right now," Münch said, adding that this is a huge challenge for security units.
Münch demanded that co-ordination between police agencies in Europe be improved and more closely communicated.
Turkish officials have stated that the live bomb that staged the Sultanahmet attack was a Syrian citizen and an ISIS member, and German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere has stated that the attacker has yet to be identified.
Sezen Aksu says good-bye to the scenes
Sezen Aksu, who decorated his 40th year with a series of concerts, charmed his loved ones with his "Years of Sezen" concert at the Volkswagen Arena last night.
The first part of the July concert series took place at the Volkswagen Arena on January 15th and 16th.
Aksu took all his listeners on a 40-year journey from yesterday to today at the concert.
In addition to the love songs that touched our personal lives, Aksu sang about our country and our world in matters of social interest.
After performing the concerts he promised, Aksu said she would say goodbye to her stage life, and upset her fans.
Sezen Aksu appeared in front of lovers who filled the Volkswagen Arena at the "Evil Years" concert with a separate story in each piece.
Each story, show, light, and stage show took viewers to a different era.
The last episode of the unforgettable concert also featured a video of the paintings of Revolution Erbil in Istanbul.
Aksu also hosted the first time on the stage of his fans' pre-recorded videos.
Bread hikes by 25 cents in Ankara, Istanbul
In Ankara, 250 grams of bread increased by 25 cents as of yesterday, and was sold at $1.
Following rumors of "a raise to the bread" in December, New Year's Eve, Special Minister Faruk Çelik and Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci made a statement saying, "There is no z.
However, in Ankara, the capital sold 250 grams of bread at $1 yesterday.
"There has been no violence, the decision on the tariff from two years ago has begun to be implemented," Turkish Bakers Federation President Halil Ibrahim Balcı said regarding the 25-cent increase in bread.
"This was a timetable decision taken two years ago."
The Trade Rooms Association set this schedule two years ago.
It's a price that's been applied throughout Turkey.
So there's been no new raises, no price hikes.
But because of competition, in some areas in Ankara, the tradesmen were selling for 75 cents.
In some areas it was already sold for $1.
The tradesman who trusted his counter, his bread, didn't lower the price. Now they have to apply $1 because of the competition.
There's no increase or raise.
They're applying the unapproved price.
"In the first half of 2016, the kilogram of bread will definitely not exceed $5, and if we don't have a lot of trouble, we'll complete the year at this price."
In some parts of Istanbul, bread was sold for $1.25.
This time, terrorism has stained Burkina Faso with blood.
23 people from 18 different countries died in the attack on the West African country Burkina Faso, targeting a luxury hotel known to be preferred by foreigners and U.N. officials.
Al Qaeda's North African branch claimed responsibility for the attack.
The attack in Burkina Faso took place four days after ISIS conducted a terrorist act in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, with 250 million populations.
A Canadian and an Indonesian lost their lives in a daylight bomb attack on the Starbucks branch and police station on a busy street with foreign embassies, luxury hotels and shops.
Indonesian officials said the attackers were inspired by the Paris massacre on November 13th.
Frank Garner, a security correspondent for British BBC television, noted that this action has been part of a frightening trend that has shown itself in many cities around the world recently.
The U.S. just got hurt by the terrorist attacks.
In early December last December, 14 people were killed in an armed attack by a couple of ISIS sympathizers in San Bernardino, California, U.S.A.
San Bernardino attack that shook the United States
Following the death of 10 German tourists in Sultanahmet, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere reminded us that there were terrorist attacks in many parts of the world, saying, "We had two major attacks in Paris."
If we say that, then the terror will be won...
We used the phrase, "No steps back."
ISIS left Whatsapp talking to the Arawi app
According to a new report, the terrorist organisation uses its own chat tool to communicate independently from chat practices such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to Defence One's report, the organisation is taking advantage of a new messaging app to communicate between them.
This Android program, "Alrawi", is distributed and loaded through an APK file.
The practice allows the organisation to communicate in code and share media.
ISIS flash move in Iraq
According to the Ghost Security Group, whatsApp and Telegram are "principle" against popular applications.
How powerful the encryption is is now unknown.
ISIS used to conduct all communications through a Telegram application that allowed messages via encrypted connection.
However, the Telegram revealed channels spoken by ISIS members.
Moreover, the US administration demands that the application developers place backdoors in its applications.
So it has now begun using its own solutions rather than relying on WhatsApp and Telegram's encryption.
UAEA: Iran nuclear satellite to deal
Speaking at a press conference in Vienna, Kerry said Iran has fulfilled its part in the nuclear deal and officially abolished economic sanctions against Iran: The International Atomic Energy Agency (UEA) said Iran has fulfilled its commitments as part of the nuclear agreement.
Iranian President Hasan Ruhani announced in his message to the Iranian people that he congratulated the removal of sanctions after the nuclear agreement between six world countries and Tehran.

In the first few minutes of the second cycle, Galatasaray has scored five to five, scoring consecutive goals.
However, Fenerbahçe, who managed to survive the shock, scored two more goals and won the fight 8-6.
Legends such as Elvir Balic, Mehmet Aurelio, Ceyhun Anadu in Fenerbahçe were in uniform, while legends such as Ayhan Akman, İmit Karan, Papen Mustafa, Hasan Shash sweated in Galatasaray.
How should the semester be evaluated?
We asked Murat Aydın, a student coach, how to evaluate the semester vacation.
Decade holidays should not be considered just recreation, entertainment, television, and computer time.
A semester’s holiday is an important opportunity to prepare for the new education period and to review the past.
A semester’s holiday, called leisure time, is also an important opportunity for personality development, knowledge, skill, and hobbies.
Make a half-year evaluation list.
Write down everything you plan to do, and try to apply it.
I assure you, you will enjoy this and have a very productive semester.
Let's talk about what a productive semester should be like for fellow students who prepare for YGS-LYS.
Because the most questions we get from friends who are preparing for the YGS-LYS exams are: "How should we evaluate this period, do we have to solve a lot of questions, or do we have to solve them?"
To answer these questions and enjoy a productive period, let us first enter our writing with recommendations to those who are preparing for the test.
The preparation process is supposed to be a process starting from the ninth grade under normal circumstances, but we're trying to complete it more in the last year, which makes it more effective for us to spend the last year using more efficient, efficient, and time in the right way.
A senior must also conduct school-written studies together as well as preparation for exams.
Even though a graduate student (YGS-LYS) who completed school has been tested and experienced at least once, the year he will be re-arranged as a graduate student is critical to him.
Because most grad students and their parents see the year 'O' as their last chance, and that creates even greater stress.
Studying is what the student does because he doesn't enjoy himself, because he feels compelled, and that's why it's usually his last work, but for the students who make it regular, habitual, it's a mission, and it's always a plan for what to do when to do.
Now, we have a semester vacation ahead of us, and we need to make the best of it.
And for that, we must have a plan to manage time well.
Study during Part-Year Holiday:
Everyone must first plan in accordance with their own situation.
What's been taken care of, what's missing; it should plan the day, the week, and the 15-day period.
During this period, there must be both recurrences and problem solutions.
At the same time, students who do not lack much may be able to do an average of a test or two.
Fix Your Missing Matters: Research shows that 75 percent of what people learn in one week, 66 percent in one day, 54 percent in one hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetting is to repeat it.
Students who have made too many mistakes in the past should weigh heavily on their work in general.
First, identify your missing topics and schedule them day by day, and make sure that each day is settled.
This planning will comfort you both academically and psychologically.
And make sure that when you put matters into your plan, you make the most mistakes.
Because later on, you won't have such a long vacation.
Do Question Solutions:
It's as important to solve questions as it is to repeat them.
Because we can only see how much we understand the work we've done through the rotations we've learned through the question we've solved.
Don't forget to put a certain number of solutions on each day.
The number of questions you're going to solve depends on what you're going to do on that day; the subject may not be able to solve a lot of questions on a day when you're doing heavy work, but we still need to do a certain amount of question-solving to see how much we've learned about that day.
Solve Tests:
Another study you'll be doing on half a year's vacation should be solving trial exams.
Although not all subjects have been completed, you can at least do test-test solutions.
Let's say you've done a lot of Turkish; you can solve 40-question essays.
And make sure that you do time work while you're doing it.
If you can solve the 40 Turkish questions in 60 minutes in the first place, then your next goal is to be able to solve them in a few minutes less if possible.
Holiday and Hobby Plan:
Holidays, of course, don't just mean studying; you need to spend a few days on vacations, rest, and hobbies.
A holiday period spent just studying will prevent you from being released and resting.
Therefore, there must be special times for you to take care of your plans.
Reading, watching TV, surfing online can also be part of your plans, but most important is how much time you have to spend.
And I have a little advice for friends who say they didn't have a good first term.
If my first semester didn't go very well, I didn't work very hard, and you're saying I'm short, this semester's vacation is a big opportunity for you, too.
But first, you have to decide and believe.
The goals were scored between 76th and 90th minutes in the 2009–10 season of the Turkish football super bowl.
Now answer the question you're asking yourself, is the game over, and you're going to the locker room, or is the game still going on, and do you have a lot of minutes to score?
I guess no one wants to say, "We're going to look at the next game."
Now all you have to do is put the past behind you and look ahead, not walk, but run.
To put together what we said:
1) Plan a semester vacation first,
2) Do it again by going over what you know.
3) Take care of your loose ends,
4) Solve questions and build up topics,
5) Solve trials,
6) Read the book,
7) Set new goals for the new era,
8) Make time for yourself, hobbies and pleasures,
9) Make time for family and friends,
10) Make time for social and cultural activities (ness, sports, theatre, concerts, tours, picnics, etc.).
'Kervan' has come a long way
The founder of Turkey's largest 'home' store chain, Shivasi Demirel and his son Hasan, each averaged 1,000 square meters and added 17 stores abroad, including the Home Sweet Home, which included 25 domestic stores, to Kervan.
With the operation recently completed, the caravan also owned 17 Home Sweet Homes abroad.
"We are now going to continue with the big store caravan and smaller store shopping with Home Sweet Home," he said, noting that there are still no caravan stores abroad.
He said, "Kervan's going to be out of the country."
A retail chain of 140m liras, including production, combined with the 2015 ciros of 50 million liras, the Home Sweet Home and the $90 million caravan.
The caravan has 45 stables in 35 provinces, with a total sales area of 45,000 square meters.
25 of the stores belong to the main company.
The caravan has jobs for about 500 people.
Home Sweet Home owns 17 stores abroad, with a total of 6,500 square metres and 320 employees.
Kadir Kalaycioğlu, chairman of the Home Sweet Home Board, whose partner is running production, exports and stores with Flame Pactek, said they were very pleased with the merger with Kervan, saying, "We are from Mardin and entered this sector in 1998."
From the beginning, with the support of the Shinasi gentlemen, we'd come up with a brand.
Mr. Shinasi is the TRT of this sector.
We learned a lot from him, too.
We even started the store when he gave us the White Central.
The caravan and I were already working together as strategic partners, not as rivals.
"Now with this merger, a very serious synergy will emerge," he said.
Kalaycioglu said that Home Sweet Home currently has 17 stores abroad, with weight in the Middle East, and that they started exporting to China last month.
"We also opened our first Korner in Shanghai."
We agreed on a chain with 200 stores.
"From now on, we will develop small stores with Home Sweet Home as caravans abroad," he said.
Poroshenko is selling his factory in Russia
Interviewing the related Liga.net news site, Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevski said the factory was being auctioned off for $200m.
"Yes, we put the factory on the market."
"As soon as we put it out for sale, all the real buyers just disappeared," he said, adding that there was no buyer.
Concerning the price of the company's factory in Lipetsk, Russia, Moskalevski said, "We've identified it as about $200m."
Roshen, one of the world's largest producers, and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, produces 450 tons of chocolate and candy a year.
Star Holdings became Pladis abroad
Star Holding has merged global companies that operate in the cookie and chocolate sectors it has purchased under the name "Pladis".
A new $5.2 billion food giant was born, working for 26,000, with a merger of De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and Ulkers.
"To be a global company was our goal from the very beginning," said Murat Ulgur, chairman of the Star Holding Board, speaking at a meeting on the merger of global companies within Star Holdings.
Murat Ulker released the sale of $335 million live from Periscope
This company, founded 72 years ago, is now moving into the world to become a global, global company in the business of biscuits and candy bars under the name of Star Holdings.
During that time, we evolved from retail to ambalage to real estate, personal care and a variety of industrial areas.
77 factories operating in 14 countries, with 300 brands, we're at thousands of sales.
"Now that we're looking at the possibilities in our family, we want to go back and focus on biscuits, chocolate candy, and we want to be global in this field; we're reorganizing for this," he said.
The story of Mr. Sabri, father of Ulker
We're reassessing our corporate structure, reorganizing.
We've divided the world into regions.
And we've shared these areas with our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tütıncı, Turkey is responsible for the Middle East, K. Africa and Turkish Republics.
Mohamed Elsacky is responsible for our global Godiva business as well as the Americas continent and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be responsible for England, Europe and Africa.
The quality and innovation guru, I'd call it, will be in charge of global responsibility in his own field, while Cem Karakash will help me manage the business.
China, Russia, in part South East Asia, will be the new areas that we will form and develop.
Murat Ulker sold stock at SAF GYO
"We promise happiness to the whole world in every bite," he added, "our global company is called Pladis."
"When you say, "Where did you invent the platinum, "there's no particular meaning to that name," he added:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
The Japanese are in Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, Süreyya, we were inspired by the name Pleiades, a Latin seven-star constellation, meaning "Elander."
So we've translated the Ulker into a global.
Deputy Director of the Star Holding Board, Ali Ögur, stressed and added that they "started to create synergy in innovation" by cooperating with laboratories in different countries:
We've got some very valuable AR-GE teams, and we've assembled these teams to get certain synergies so far in the study of an AR-GE platform.
We have 27 Ar-GE centers under the Pladis.
Turkey and England are the largest of them.
We have over 300 AR-GE specialists working here.
Synergy studies have already begun to yield results.
Degestives (Nibbles) is produced in the chocolate factory of Ulvar, which is produced in the country and will begin exporting to England.
Another example of synergy: brands are different, but products are the same, Country Krispi Scratch.
By adapting a cracker technology developed in England, the Jacob's Crinklys product, to Turkey, we soon acquired a taste for our country under the name Country Krispi Scratcher.
Laviva, whom we all know very well, met with consumers in America today.
The Call of Duty series has exceeded 250 million.
This series, which Activation, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games etched in gold letters, seems to have been remembered for many years.
In particular, the newly announced sales numbers prove just how legendary we need to find them.
Activision, which retains the series' license rights, showed 250 million copies at the end of the year in its private sales issue.
At the beginning of last year, the company has been able to sell 75 million Call of Duty games since then.
And most of that number, of course, is the Black Ops 3 game, so we're not wrong.
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu has been elected President once again
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu has been re-elected President of the Convention.
Kılıçdaroğlu, who won 990 votes from 1,238 delegates who voted, is the president again.
248 of the votes have been invalidated.
After the conclusion was announced, party members showed joy.
The CHP had a total of 1,275 delegates.
The Kurultai completed its work to meet at 10:00 p.m. on Sunday.
Kılıçdaroğlu briefly said:
We wanted to play games here. We wanted to sing songs.
But the point we're coming to is not good.
There's an unmanageable fact of Turkey.
The atmosphere is clouding all of this.
It's the people who run the country that make the pessimistic picture.
As CHPs, we're against terror wherever it comes from, whatever it comes from.
Terror is a crime of humanity, and terrorists must never be forgiven.
The fight against terror is done with wisdom, done with knowledge, done with wisdom.
Sure, let's fight. We don't want anyone getting a nosebleed.
What's the difference between photographs in Syria and Lebanon, photos in the Southeast?
When they sat at the table, they made some serious mistakes.
Power is responsible for all the blood flowing, the tears, the dead.
In 2002, they surrendered the country with zero terrors, and today there is a Turkey turning into a bloodbath.
Who is responsible for all this?
The taxi driver in Diyarbakir is Şehmuz?
What's Turkey paying for?
We're going to be in meetings, we're going to talk about changing the laws of coupling.
We will not allow anyone to build a country on their personal views.
I say, "Come on, let's change the coupling spirit."
The intellectuals of this country are being raided at the crack of dawn, taken into custody.
There are ways we don't agree, but people should be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictator says, "He who eats the bread of the state and is hostile to the state."
So I wanted to ask him, why didn't they think about it when the people who ate the bread of the state and used all the resources of the state were robbing the government?
CHP is the party that brings the biggest changes to this country.
We will prepare for the fourth great revolution together.
Whatever the cost, we will surely bring a liberal democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, take us into custody, whatever they do, whatever the cost, the CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I'm calling you loud and clear, Davutoglu.
Hiding behind the coup law, the man hiding hasn't let go of his mind about the coup.
You gave the honorary service medal to the man who gave it to you.
What blow are you talking about?
It's all about tricking the public.
Party officials listed the other three revolutions as the end of the 1st great revolution, the establishment of the Republic, the arrival of the 2nd great revolution in the time of the Inönu, the arrival of the more party period than the single-party period, the transition of the 3rd revolution to social democracy with Bülent Ejevit...
The president has qualities, duties.
Article 103 has the President's oath.
We know how important the concept of honor and honor is in this society.
When a person comes out and makes that promise, he'll do it to his death.
Because honor and honor are indisputable to us.
The man with the dictator, what does honor and honor mean to you?
What do you know about honor and honor, and why did you take this oath?
What do you mean by honor and honor?
That's what I want to know.
In a religious man, the concept of honor and honor is the crowning crown.
They're not trying to break the coup law, they're trying to uphold the coup law.
It's not enough. They want the presidential system.
What kind of president; bossed presidential system.
Why are you rejecting the Ottoman parliamentary system?
Anyone who orders one will do what is necessary.
Is the parliamentary worker working well in Turkey?
No, it doesn't.
If we bring in the liberal democracy, the system works.
They call it a coup, but they've strengthened the coup law.
Izmir MP Mustafa Balbay, who announced his candidacy for the presidency, failed to participate in the race because he failed to obtain the signatures of 128 delegates needed for the nomination.
Balbay, who was able to obtain 92 signatures, said, "I can't run under current conditions."
The parliamentary assembly (PM), the centre executive council (MYK) and the honour board members of the convention hall noted that former CHP leader Deniz Baykal was sitting in the stands with the party members.
Stanbul MP Gülay Responsor has not been seated for MPs but has come early to sit next to President Kılıçdaroğlu.
Yalova MP Muharrem İnce’s meeting with Kılıçdaroğlu has become one of the topics discussed in the convention hall.
He explained that he had been offered a membership in the PM, and he himself did not accept it.
Sources from the headquarters, however, have claimed that the request for a meeting came from İnce and that it was not recommended for membership in the PM.
"No one posted a message on Twitter saying that these headquarters, the content of this meeting can be learned from İstanbul MP Ali Ozcan".
And Ozcan said, "How could I know about two people meeting?"
He just said, "He's gone and he's seen her."
Kılıçdaroğlu often applauded the press.
The party council (PM) has marked the first day of the usual "Democracy, Change and Brotherhood Council".
Kılıçdaroğlu went to his house after the convention speech and started working on the PM list.
Kılıçdaroğlu’s 100-person key list has been made known by the current MEK members that he will call 13 MyK members outside of Seyhan Erdoğdu, who did not apply for PM, Jakup Akkaya, Senzanr Ayata, Ercan Karakaş and PM once again.
Kılıçdaroğlu can also point to another list of 100-person PM keys, as well as another narrowed-down list.
The 21-point resolution adopted unanimously in the CHP Council demanded that the dismantling of provisions on the European Regional Government Condition, which came up with the debates on autonomy of the DTK, increase power sharing in the local area.
The declaration also included the aims of "the end of the party state order", "the establishment of a state of law that can be accounted for and accounted for".
Kültay MP Selçuk Özdağ, İdris Baluken from HDP, Rusar Demirel from MHP followed.
AK Party’s Özdağ and EC Party delegation left the hall after Kılıçdaroğlu harshly criticised President Erdoğan.
"I saw that he was missing the dose of criticism, and I couldn't possibly accept it," Özdağ said.
The banner, which includes photographs of arrested journalists Can Dündar and Erdem Gül in the hall, “How can the darkness come out if I don’t burn if you don’t burn up” and the sign “Peace” in Kurdish, Turkish and English drew attention.
The Kurultay began in the morning with group Comments and Ahmet Kaya songs.
Türkan Elçi, wife of Diyarbakır Bar President Tahir Elçi who lost his life in the shooting, received a big round of applause.
Berkin Elvan's mother, Gülsum, and his father, Sami Elvan, also joined the board.
Kılıçdaroğlu said they would own democracy "death" at whatever price needed to be paid was the most applauded part of the speech.
So far, the CHP has gathered 52 conventions -- 34 regular and 18 extraordinary -- at the Ankara Arena yesterday.
The turnout was high.
There were over 15,000 CHPs in the 12,000-seat lounge.
However, there was no enthusiasm for the crowd.
The most exciting moment was when Kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu.
The excitement continued while the couple of Kılıçdaroğlu greeted the hall.
There was no discipline at the AK Party conventions.
Even as Kılıçdaroğlu was talking, there was a lot of activity in the area in Arena's field.
Obviously, CHP members who wanted to enter the Party Assembly preferred to seek support by telling party leaders and journalists about themselves.
"It's better than having the extra parties lined up like ropes, like parties in Korea or the Soviet Union," a CHP executive said.
There is another difference between the CHP board and the EC Party or the MHP conventions.
Only presidents speak at these parties.
In CHP, the convention becomes a platform where party problems are also discussed.
With a large number of party members who wanted to speak at yesterday's convention, Council President Murat Karayalç had trouble adjusting the deadline.
There was a distance in the faces and languages from the comments, "The place is going badly", but "You can change the course with the painting that's coming out of this room."
Even though all CHPs said, "Do something," there was no consistent and strong answer to the question, "What do you do?"
The effect was that there would be no choice in the next four years.
When Kılıçdaroğlu took the stand, we journalists waited for him to answer the question, "What should he do?"
Kılıçdaroğlu answered the question “What is going on” first.
He pointed out the problem of arrested journalists, what happened to academics due to the declaration, what happened in the Southeast, the impasse of foreign policy.
The CHP has long responded to its "Anatolian legends" about its party, such as "the silent party", "the battle supports", "the party of the elitist", "the party of the elitist".
And when he got to the "what to do" stage, instead of talking about concrete steps, he tried to bring up "strateji."
He stressed that all these problems could be overcome by more powerful democracy and more justice.
He also made a promise to the CHP, and he said, "We'll work at whatever cost until we bring democracy."
"We will fight to the death for democracy," he said.
A final note is also to remind you that the CHP has handled the "organisation" issue as of the 53rd convention, and is now able to collect the convention without any problems.
Meanwhile, 900 journalists who were supposed to follow the board were issued cards, but journalist participation in the hall was not at that level.
Ankara representatives of media companies were not as eager to follow the board as the EC Party conventions were.
Self-government has been asked for life
The indictment prepared by Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office on 7 arrested defendants has been accepted by the 4th Heavy Penal Court.
Following the orders and calls of the top executives of the PKK/KCK terrorist group, the indictment stated that statements have been made under the name "expericution" in some districts and neighborhoods of Diyarbakır, İstanbul, Şırnak, Mardin, Mardin, Mush, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Ağra.
The indictment stating that illegal action has been called on by the ringleaders and women of the organisation, noted that there has been an increase in attacks on security forces in Diyarbakır’s Sur, Bağlar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro districts, public institutions and organisations, houses, businesses and vehicles.
ISIS and opposers clashed. Our outpost was shot.
The recent clashes between Düden, Kara Mezra Büdddin of Syria across the Yavuzlu village of Kilis, and ISIS and opposition groups in Black Bridge Village continue to escalate.
The sound of weapons and mortars fired during the clashes between ISIS and the opposition, which ran near the border, is also heard by Turkey.
Smokes rising from areas where the explosions often took place naked by Turkey, while security forces took heavy precautions with armored vehicles on the border line.
On the other hand, harassment was fired at the Martyr Mehmet Border Station near the Yavuzlu village of Kilis of Bülddin village under the control of ISIS militants.
In accordance with the rules of engagement, the soldiers responded to the area where the harassment fire was opened with vans and heavy weapons.
Russian fighter planes allegedly launched an attack on Hamaz village, 17km from Turkey's border.
Six Syrians wounded in air bombing were brought to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by relatives.
The lotto rich take their checks
The Robinson couple, who lived in a small house worth $150,000 in Munford, Tennessee, chose to receive a single payment of $328m (about $1 billion) over a total of $528.8 million (1.6 billion tl) over a period of 29 years.
The couple said, "After all, there's no guarantee of tomorrow."
John Robinson, who works on a chain of stores and his wife Lisa, who works as an assistant to a dermatologist, said they'll be in charge on Monday, even though they're millionaires now.
With the money they earn, the couple aims primarily to pay off the mortgage debt and help their relatives.
It was announced that the jackpot was divided into three.
iOS9: How to get a new iPhone operating system, Apple update published
You can go to Settings for the new operating system, touch "Genele" and choose "Written Update".
When you are ready, your phone will provide you with the option to download and install.
Some users had a problem following this installation and received an error message saying, "Writtering update failed."
To overcome this problem, users are advised to wait for the system to decrease or try and raise iTunes from there.
The phone will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may also mean erasing applications to make room -- but Apple reduces the update and prevents it from happening, and recommends some applications to remove it, and uses a special tool to rebuild it when the process is over.
It's worth making sure that your phone is charged or that you're with a charger to make sure your battery doesn't run out while the update continues.
If the battery's too low, Apple won't allow an update, because the phone can stop halfway through to cut it off.

FedEx's revenues are mixed, financial outlook will drop in 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the past three months, and the cargo giant reduced its profit forecast all year due to lower demand for cargo services and increased cost in ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasons of workers for holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced he was hiring 50,000 seasons for vacations.
Wednesday's opening bell dropped about 2.5% in pre-opening operations 45 minutes ago.
FedEx Corp said that between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, this is less than 20 cents, according to previous estimates.
Analysts expected $10.84 based on research by FactSet.
The average increase of 4.9%, which will be valid on January 4th, and the possibility of dropping despite high discharges in November on heavy or large packages' land transport.
Cost cuts, higher income and profits from the growth of e-commerce are still expected to be higher than the previous year, the company said.
President and CEO Fred Smith said the company "exclusively performed "in spite of poor economic conditions in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday employment plans were announced a day after the rival company UPS, which says UPS plans to hire 90,000 to 90,000 extra workers in the same amount as last year.
During the three-month period, which ended on 31 August, FedEx increased its revenue by 6% compared to the previous year, earning $692 million.
The profit per share was $2.42 behind estimates by 12 analysts discussed by Zacks Investment Research.
Income's up 5%, $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx was hit last year by a decline in international priority transport, which led to a recession in the Express unit.
However, the explosion in online shopping has raised FedEx Ground Service results.
In the last quarter, ground service revenue increased by 29%, but business revenue was basically stagnant due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
As revenues fell in the shipping business at high labour costs, the express unit saw high income due to high base rates.
In pre-opening operations about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx stocks dropped to $150.15 by $3.85 or $2.5%.
They closed Tuesday at 11% for the year and 17% below the record level on 11 June.
In their most expected meetings over the years, Federal Reserve politicians decided that it was not time to increase interest rates with a 27-foot Honduras mahogany around the table for almost a decade.
The two-story meeting room in one wing of the central bank will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed's Lady President Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues hold the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has two jobs from Congress: to maximize US employment and to stabilize prices here.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is a third power of attorney that has not been written: financial balance.
And this third power of attorney may be the X factor in an unpredictably close decision on whether the U.S. economy, which will be announced Thursday, is ready to be cut off from a near-zero-term interest rate that has been going on since the end of 2008.
Although most data show that the economy is growing soundly, the latest turmoil in global financial markets can make careful Fed officials, reference federal funds interest -- even less than a quarter of a percent -- nervous about adding vulnerability.
"Clearly, the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they will watch," said Stifel Nicolaus & Co's chief economist Lindsey M. Piezza.
"But I think if they are looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the growing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough reason to wait a little longer," he said.
Fed has no idea what he's going to do, and it's causing fluctuations in his financial markets.
Recently, half of the economists Bloomberg was seeing were expecting an increase in interest this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to stand by with the main indicator, which shows only the possibility of an increase of about 30%.
This could indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, while policymakers promise another increase could be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial index average rose to 16,599.85, up by 228.89 points or 1.4%.
"The rate of the current Fed policy makers has been triggered by the expectation that they will keep it steady this week," said John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be amazing if Fed could increase the rates right now," he said.
If Fed executives had made that decision, they would have had to have a long year to calm the financial markets so they wouldn't panic."
A rise in proportion to the lift of the fog curtain on when Fed will take action could calm the financial markets, other experts said.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be on the way to increasing the rate of 0.25 percent this month, which would be a small step to strengthening the recovery of the United States on the way to slowly contracting monetary conditions.
Despite the liberals' complaints about the need for a more economic process, he said he expects this year's increase in the spring and early summer.
Although the rate of creation of work dropped in August, growth in the labour market was stable this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%, the lowest in seven years, last month, and closes to the level Fed considers full employment.
Pay raises showed signs of improvement.
And although inflation continues to monitor below 2% of the central bank's annual target, Fed politicians say the temporary impact of sharply reduced oil prices is an important reason.
Pantheon Macroeconomist chief economist Ian Shepherdson said the economy "can deal with higher rates and needs them despite the difficulties in the labour market".
But the financial markets around the world began to shake after China finally went into devaluation in the currency last month.
The Dow Jones industrial index average dropped about 16% below the record level in May due to the fear that investors would bring global growth down by a slowing Chinese economy.
Somehow, when the market was now below almost 10% of Dow's high level in May, it jumped back.
For Fed policy makers, market unrest complicates the calculation of the time when interest rate will be increased.
"They may have been a little limited at this meeting with the lack of news about economic weakening and the lack of news in the financial markets in the Chinese economy over the past few weeks," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research partner and former Fed at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate.
Now he's predicting they'll wait at least another month to manage these effects better.
"There is much uncertainty about the impacts on the United States economy, and they have virtually no data to rely on the historicity of developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of Fed's primary concerns, so technically, there should be no factor in the landing process.
But in reality, Fed became the financial authority of the world.
The central bank's influence over the last few years has been enormous.
Until then, the only lead from President Ben S. Bernanke was that in 2013 the Fed could "develop" the monetary expansion triggered by market tremors worldwide.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials may not only be expected to pursue developments elsewhere but also consult other central bank managers and experts to better read the global economy.
Envestnet Inc.'s global strategy chief Zachary Karabell said the decision-making process was "a skill rather than science".
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va President Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that "Fed has overreacted in the past to the actions of financial markets that do not appear to be linked to economic foundations".
Lacker, a member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee and pressured for a higher rate, referred to 1998-99 decisions, for example.
"Despite limited identifiable recommendations for US growth", the financial crisis in Asia caused Fed to cut 0.75 per cent during three meetings," he said.
A year later, the Fed officials took back those cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Central Bank of England survey committee, said, "Fed should only put financial balance concerns first during major crises, as in the 2008 market meltdown."
He said that the last convulsion didn't get near that level.
He said you don't really want to have to be afraid to go up in the market because the market's upset, and Peterson International Economic Institute President Posen said you don't really want to be afraid to go up in the world.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers, and it doesn't talk about financial balance, and I don't think they should act in that direction until that changes.
You want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown.
The market/depo opened in 1997 and belongs to LAX-Cşti.
It's also known as Thai Costco, a total Thai market that sells to the L.A.X.C. ring.
Yeah, that's Chinatown, not Taiwan.
The market/depo is a one-stop store; it sells lots of fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Asian and Thai snacks, kitchen snacks, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even the automotive part if you want to buy motor oil.
The store's huge, and it could take an hour to go through all the corridors.
If you get hungry in all this shopping, grab some food from LAX-C BBQ Eksres.
The store's internal food is next to the good, calculated vaults, and they have various ways of getting out.
What's he stocking up on: you want something from Thailand?
L.A.X.C. probably has one.
The products are reasonably priced, and some of them are mass-selling.
Among the fresh products are special Asian and regional Thai spices, fruits and more.
The meat rack is very extensive, so is the fish -- the people behind the counter, they clean the fish and they make the filets, and they fry it if you want.
Most of the store has a large freezer section where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galangals, all duck, fish, veal blood, fish balls, regional sausages, commercial food, and more.
Who shops: restaurant owners and cooks, families and individuals.
There are both shopping carts and forklifts in large corridors.
Found by the fresh monthong durian exit stand.
The store is a few blocks from Philippe The Original in the industrial section of Los Angeles between Chinatown and downtown.
Park: LAX-C has its own parking space, shares it with other stores and restaurants.
Although the store is very busy, parking isn't usually hard to find.
Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Society promotes healthy nutrition during nursing period
The Brazilian pediatric organisation SPRS resorted to a shocking method, giving pictures of a milk child depicted in poor food depictions to try and explain the importance of healthy nutrition in the process of breast feeding women.
Human milk is made up of many types of proteins, fat, vitamins, and carbs that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a healthy immune system.
Due to energy surplus requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie purchases by around 500 calories.
Yet, new research shows that the mothers need to receive food supplements, not just calorie purchases.
According to a new study conducted under Professor Robert Waterland of the University of Medicine of Texas, the healthy diet of pregnant women influenced the genetic expression of their babies to protect them from tumor development.
Sadly, malnutrition has been detected that the child’s immune system is negatively affected.
Seven's Sunrise still excels in ratings despite Nine's efforts to take over the Today Show
The moves Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson made to Canberra to overthrow Liberal's leadership failed to provide a ratings boost for Today.
After Tony Abbott's fall of Malcolm Turnbull, Granny's breakfast show was performed in the national capital.
Rival Sunrise, hosted in London by David Koch and Samantha Army, is trapped in the weekly international series, including Dubai, Niagara Falls, New York, and Cancun.
The distance problem doesn't seem to make much difference to Australian viewers, and Sunrise has an average of 397.000 viewers in five capitals for Today's 339.
Today (317.000) had a slight increase in ratings compared to last Tuesday (283,000), but the figure was still behind last Thursday (343,000)
Today's been catching up with Sunrise for the last few months.
In August, Sunrise averaged 318,000 for 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
By now in September, Today averaged 314,000 to the Sunrise at 349.000.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect the people this morning rather than parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the breathtaking beginning of the 800 words of Erik Thomson, star of the old Packed to the Rafters.
The new drama about a newly widowed father deciding to move to the seaside in New Zealand with his two children has reached an impressive average of 1,219 million.
Critics questioned whether Thomson could run a solo show without Rebecca Gibney, the star of Rafters.
Last night's conclusion was a ringing yes.
Seven's X Factor maintained its power with 1,136 million viewers, defeating Block (838.000) and the TBL Families (726.000) easily.
Two Chases Love mixed up the night's fortunes with Australia.
The first half hour (17:00–1730) of the new information competition, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, reached an average of 446.000 viewers.
In the second half hour (17:30–18:00), the number jumped to 623.000 viewers -- enough to win a small victory against Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (63,000).
The first half hour of Monday Night Follow-Australia averaged 550,000 viewers, while the number rose to 750,000 in the second half hour.
The Hot Seat had 660,000 averages.
The chase led Grandma to believe that the Hot Seat would be the upper hand at 5:30 on the second night of Australia's ratings.
Following Australia was a change in the million dollar Minutes that didn't have teeth in McGaire's show.
It was originally published as the Sunrise prevails as Today stays local.
The three last to go, they think Single Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who's he gonna pick?
Did the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who would win the bachelor.
At the end of Sam Wood's single program, the woman was left in great secrecy.
And the other three girls are doing everything they can not to tell us who took the last rose.
But if we check out Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski the day before the three people fell in two, they might have given us a clue as to who the winner would be.
Sam Wood sealed his mouth until Thursday's final.
All three women, in a lyrical language, explained why Wood was perfect; by highlighting his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude, they said why they wanted to be his partners.
But if it's not you, who should have Wood's last rose?" The answers may contain information about who will win The Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best candidate for Wood except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been close since day one.
Jeavons-Fellows said, "From the moment I got home, I felt that they were compatible by reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy, and that's what I thought during the program."
"Sarah is very practical, it's fun to be around her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel so good and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are going to be a great couple.
Mackay said last week's house calls made him think Wood was the right guy.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized it was definitely not just a game -- I'm completely committed to him now."
When asked who Wood would have chosen without him, it was mysterious.
He said, "I don't know if I can say this."
"I love other girls equally - Snezana and Lana equal."
The Bachelor is on Ten at 7:30 on Wednesday.
First broadcast, is Sarah the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options for where he was going to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle paid a lot of attention to him after he moved to the U.S., and after last year's impressive open practice day, a lot of other teams approached him.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and his coach, Jim Tomsula, and that seems to be a very wise decision.
Some coaches backed up Hayne on Tuesday, as they did in the 20-3 win against Minnesota, due to his loss in the Australian rugby league.
But Tomsula believed this man and gave Hayne another chance to play in a play after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula continued to show her true color in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of humiliating the rookies in front of the whole team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also openly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
Cam Inman, a reporter for the 49ers team, said Hayne was also encouraged by special team co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey and was advised to forget about the drop and consider the next game.
Jarryd Hayne made Minnesoa Vikings score in the first quarter and dropped the ball.
This wasn't what hayne and his large Australian fan base imagined for their first game at the NFL.
He was seen swearing when he dropped the ball, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy that he couldn't think of a worse start for his NFL career at 2DayFM 104.1.
"That was just one of those things, you'll feel sorry for the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also reminded Queensland of the 2007 Origin's first game with a back pass.
Still, it's been a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne released a photo of her holding an Australian flag with fans after the game on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint at a crossing in Siberia.
Khodorkovsky, who openly opposed President Vladimir Putin, was imprisoned, the oil company Yukos was seized, and his pro-democracy efforts were cut short.
Police Shooting Plastic Bullets at Protesters in Nepal Killed 4 People
Four people died Wednesday, including a 4-year-old boy, as police fired plastic bullets at a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official reported.
The incident occurred Tuesday evening in Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital, Katmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district chief official, said that from 1,000 protestors gathered outside a police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used pepper spray to fire in the air before using plastic bullets.
He said 20 cops and five civilians were injured.
It's not clear why plastic bullets used to kill are usually less deadly alternatives, resulting in such a high mortality case.
The conflict was the last of several weeks of violent protests throughout Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group suggest that the new constitution would thin out their political influence.
The ethnic Tharus group, which wants to form their own state, is protesting in western Nepal.
At least 40 people have lost their lives, 11 of whom are police officers, in violent clashes since 10 August.
At this time, four major political parties agreed to divide the country into regions -- an important but creative step to draft a new constitution in Nepal, which has been ruled by the central state for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been under way since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake in April that killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers worked on draft constitutional provisions in Katmandu this week, and officials said the new text will be held by Sunday.
NHC says there's a 60% chance of hurricanes south of the Cape Verde Islands.
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Centre said a large low-pressure system (360km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 per cent likely to turn into a tropical hurricane within the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low pressure system was also seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecast said there is a 60 per cent chance of a tropical hurricane forming within the next two days.
Google launched a donor matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a charity-matching campaign aimed at collecting $11m for humanitarian organisations that have fled their war-damaged and poverty-stricken countries and helped thousands of refugees to Europe.
Google posted an unexpected personal approach to the donation initiative on its blog.
Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote her own personal experience.
"In addition to hunger, thirst, cold and fear, there were many dark buses and trains on our journey," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But because the refugee and immigrant crisis in Europe has grown, many families, like my family, need help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organisations offering aid to refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Recovering Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match the first $5.5 million donation to Google.com/refugeerefef until it raises $11 million.
Europe has been facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, and the main reason is the four-year Syrian civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
He is also fleeing Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, suffering from many wars.

A weight loss surgery can help with a moderately obese diabetic.
According to a new study, it may take at least five years for type 2 medium obesity patients to benefit from obesity surgery.
But it's too early to tell whether diabetes patients, who are moderately obese, have lived longer than patients who haven't had surgery since obesity.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote an article in the new study on JAMA surgery, who specializes in obesity surgery, "it takes a long time for mortality rates to manifest themselves."
Weight loss surgeries, also known as bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the stomach diameter.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been done on advanced obese individuals with body mass index (VKI) 35 or more.
BMI, measured by the height of the weight, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
25 or more BMIs show that they're overweight, and over 30 BMIs are obese.
BMI can calculate from this link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new research, Taiwan's full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital has used data from two kinds of bariatric surgery -- gastric bypass and tube stomach surgeries -- which have been used since 2007 to treat type 2 diabetics.
From the end of the fifth year of the study, the average BMI was reduced from 31 to 24.5 surgeries.
In response to that, the BMIs of those treated for non-surgical diabetes remained stable around 29.
Diabetes has been partially solved in 36% of all surgeries and 28%.
In a group that has been treated medically, diabetes has been completely solved in only one percent and only two percent.
The writers also noted that blood pressure control, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol, were usually better in the surgically-treated group.
Researchers also showed blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, which reflects blood sugar levels in patients over time.
According to researchers, A1c hemoglobin is best kept below 7%.
After the surgery, A1c hemoglobin dropped from the average nine percent to about six percent.
The group that receives medical treatment remains stable at around 8%.
But with improved A1c hemoglobin levels, this better "glysemic control", according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu, who conducts the research, has not reduced his mortality rate in these five years.
The research team compared the findings to these two types of surgeries.
In the fifth year, a group with more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and A1c hemoglobin (3.1% to 2.1%) have lost more weight compared to the group with the tube stomach surgery (4.9 to 16.7 %).
Although the research did not specify any clear benefits of post-op survival at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone of Arizona Medical College-Phoenix said that the surgery had valid data that the surgery extended its life span, according to a study conducted in larger patients in Sweden.
Swedish was 29 per cent less likely to die in 15 years than any other group with more traditional treatment.
Although this new study does not show what the benefits of the survival of surgical patients are, according to Blackstone, and for people below BMI 35, this is reassuring.
This is the most crucial part of the article, because BMI says this surgery is safe in the low group, and there has been no increase in risk of death or renal disorders.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should begin to take seriously the issue of weight gain with the patient dropping below 27 to 30 BMI.
I think he said we waited long enough for people to take this seriously.
I think it's really hard to reverse these genetic changes that make their bodies linked to obesity and diabetes.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama said Europe cannot host all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in refugees' countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre, which will be working on ethics at the beginning of a 10-day visit to England.
Under the current circumstances, he claimed that human interests should be put first rather than the interests of countries or continents.
At the same time, he stressed that the responses of countries in Western Europe to the refugee crisis are insufficient.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis are appreciated, the Dalai Lama said they were only temporary solutions.
"It is great to care for a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions; you have to think about how you can bring lasting peace and lasting development to these Muslim countries through education," he stressed.
We need to think about how to reduce deaths in our country.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Use of force has never been a solution to problems," he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also referred to George Bush's actions after the 9/11 attacks and said that the United States' violent responses started a chain of uncontrollable events.
In my letter to President Bush after 9/11, I expressed my condolences and expressed that the way to solve this problem was through nonviolent methods.
I know his motives are well-intentioned, but he used force and caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four times higher in the last four years when children ingest hand antiseptic.
Toxic control centers in the United States reported an increase in high levels of wet wipe swallowing in children under 12 since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of hand-to-hand antiseptic ingestion in children under the age of 12 reported to the center increased from 3,266 cases to 16,117 in 2014.
Lopez told CNN, "The children are more popular with this kind of product, and unfortunately, there are those among them who are more likely to be rushed to the emergency room."
He said some kids drank hand antiseptics on purpose, and some of them did it in a social media contest to impress their friends.
YouTube videos show teenagers who drink antiseptic for cheap drunkenness.
Some adolescents have reportedly mixed the antiseptic mixture with mouthwaters that contain alcohol to get a stronger gut.
Little kids can be attracted to the smell of antiseptic.
Lopez said, "The kid doesn't think it's a bad thing."
Most of the more attractive (hand antiseptics) are the scented ones.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-flavored hand antiseptics that are extremely attractive to children.
Hand antiseptics contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially with little kids, it can only cause a few sips of alcohol poisoning.
According to Dr. Stephen Thornton, head of the hospital's toxicity center at the University of Kansas, the city of Kansas, Fox 4 said that "high concentration is alcohol."
You don't leave a few whiskey glasses lying around, but people leave these hand antiseptics out in the open, and that's a pretty easy way for kids to get a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old who recently swallowed only four pinches of strawberry-scented hand antiseptic in his school, was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was 0.179, and according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the ER doctor who took care of him at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta, it was twice the legal alcohol limit accepted in a grown man.
Nhaijah couldn't pronounce words and he couldn't walk when he came to the emergency room.
Rithey reported that because alcohol caused the little girl to fall and hit her head, the doctors kept her overnight under observation in a separate children's hospital despite any sign of brain trauma.
Anne Ortoria Scott told CNN it was "very scary".
It could have been lethal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to keep antiseptic handkerchiefs’ contact with the skin short and put them where the children can't reach.
Other than alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics were found to be linked to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died of ingesting hand antiseptic, which contained an unexplained substance.
Health officials have suggested that the substance may not be ethyl alcohol, as indicated on the list of contents, but it may have a fatal effect on methyl alcohol.
In January, three fourth-graders from the north of New York conspired to poison their "evil" teachers according to police reports, "to plant anti-bacterial products around the classroom".
The teacher was highly allergic to hand antiseptics, so she banned it from being used in class.
Police have referred to this plan as a "empty attempt" to recommend disciplinary action to the school board.
Come to Samandira.
Robin van Persie, who watched Fenerbahçe's Euro League match with Lokomotif Kuban, met with Udoh, Vesely and Melih at the end of the match.
Van Persie, who had a warm conversation with Udoh, who was a fan of his, said, "I've come to watch you."
You and your friends are gonna watch me practice.
He said, "I'm waiting for you in Samandira."
The bitch is innocent.
I'm such a humanist today.
I want there to be no deaths.
But it's not possible!
This world is cruel.
Felekse is a bitch.
Death is fate.
Pain, too.
And the alien invasion.
So is lightning.
Sometimes it's a crashed space shuttle.
Maybe a meteor.
I mean, no, no, no, no.
I mean, let's sign it.
Let's put our reaction to it.
Let's say, bitch, what a disaster!
Let our humanity grow.
And shame on the fel.
But he's not ashamed, damn it!
Two weeks ago, they killed Miray Ince in the Sur quarter of Şırnak.
He was only three months old.
His grandfather was with him.
They killed him, too.
What can we say, bitch?
I think he was running from aliens.
They scanned him while he was looking for a safe place.
His wife was with him.
The day after that, in Diyarbakir, they killed Angel Alpaddin at the breakfast table on Little Transpolar Street.
A day or two later, Sema Jinglioğlu burned down the Elementary School.
Two days ago, the same aliens attacked another school full of students with firearms.
The students ran away from one place to another.
On January 10, three men killed in the attack of a whore in the Holy Hüseyin Mosque in the district of Martyr Harun Boy were released.
Three children died in Çınar district of Diyarbakır two days ago.
An unidentified object killed these little ones with a ton of explosives.
There have been other deaths, there have been injuries.
Who's the culprit?
Felek, of course.
Son of a bitch.
No, she's not the bitch.
The bitch is innocent!
The killer's out there, waving his arm and smiling at us.
Others try to divert attention.
While the killer is right in front of us, it gives him opportunities to escape, rather than point out the killer.
He's shielding the killer.
He's hiding it.
And after he disappeared, he tells everyone that he didn't actually have a crime.
The sides of the fight we've had in the last 10 years are very clear.
Someone wants the circle of fire around us to tighten and burn us down.
And someone's trying to stop it, and moreover put out the fire around us.
Someone's trying to tear it down, loot it.
Someone's after making, producing.
There are those who have seen all kinds of war for us, for our territory.
Civil war.
Interstate war.
The battle of the sects.
The custody battle.
And they have subcontractors.
Dirty terrorist organizations.
Bloody clowns.
Different names, formats.
Turkey has no choice but to fight each and every one of them.
He's fighting, and that's why he has to deal with all of them.
Keep fighting until you're sure of your vices...
Traitors didn't have skirts. They took shelter in the white cloth.
The PKK members, cornered between the neighborhoods, find the cure to blend in with white flags and escape from citizens.
Security forces are implementing GBT to prevent the breach.
The activist force of the organisation, which took a major blow in the countryside and across the border, which began on July 23rd, is also being broken in the districts.
According to sources in the region, Silopi's large hit organisation was seized and disarmed.
Some citizens, who have fled the PKK's attacks, are moving away from conflict points under police and military control with white flags.
Terrorists trapped between the streets and couldn't find an escape route began to run away with the white flag, blending in with the citizens.
Security units are conducting a general information collection (GBT) investigation into persons they suspect.
In Silopi, it was said that a PKK terrorist was involved with the white flag, but when he realized he would be caught during the GBT interrogation, he tried to escape and was neutralized.
THE KOMANDOS WILL PREVIOUS THE SILENCE
Military and police have struck a major blow to the terrorist organization in Cizre, one of the districts carefully followed.
The Yafes Neighborhood, where militants nested, has been largely cleared.
Joint teams of police and gendarmerie special operations have completed their duties and left their positions to the commandos.
The commandos who settled in Yafes Neighborhood are also taking precautions to prevent the terrorists from infiltrating again.
In other counties, it has been reported that security in the areas where the joint teams have cleared the terrorists will be left to the commandos.
A ton of baklava for the police and soldiers
Kilis Municipality has sent a ton of baklava to special operations officers and soldiers, who are working hard in Cizre, Sur and Silopi.
"Let my Lord give power and strength to our security forces who protect their homeland and nation in difficult circumstances," said Mayor Hasan Kara, who said they cursed terror.
He said, "We pray for God's mercy on our witnesses and the immediate healing of our veterans."
The sycamores told us about the night of terror
The sycamore people reacted greatly to the attack.
Most of the houses around the housing surrounding the explosion have become uninhabitable.
"My son was wounded, but we couldn't get out of the house because there were gunshots.
An hour later, we were able to take my son to the hospital."
Sabiha Özcan, who stated that his wife had been injured, said, "My wife was injured while she was sleeping in the room at the explosion.
He dragged himself to the door."
He was covered in blood.
He said, "I curse this whole thing."
14 people died on the ski road
The bus carrying skiers from Japan's ski districts in Karuizawa collapsed by losing control.
The accident reported that 14 members of the group were killed and 27 others were injured.
Officials said the bus fell about 10 feet [3 m] high and crashed into the barrier.
There was no ice on the road, and there was an investigation into the accident.
He ripped out a 50-mile concrete road and sold it!
Aleksander Protopopov, director of a prison in the Russian Koni region, was arrested on charges of selling 50km of concrete road to the highway.
Protopopov received $80,000 (243,000) in this method, which used his position to remove and sell some of the concrete that was laid on the highway.
7,750 euros for 15 million lire
A woman named Viola Colombo, who lives in Venice, Italy, won the right to convert 15 million lire of euros from an e-bay online auction site.
In 2014, the Central Bank rejected Colombo's request to replace the old Italian currency lire for a few euros.
Colombo, which the court finds to be right, will receive 7,750 euros (about $26,000).
Applying for a woman-free island in UNESCO
Japan applied for the list of UNESCO World Cultural Heritage in 2017, the island of Okinoshima, where only men are allowed to set foot on its temples.
However, the clergy on the island object to this decision because they are concerned about the future of "Turist".
Saudi Arabia did not give up TUBITAK
"The number of BALISTIKAs that will serve in Saudi Arabia will go from 6 to 14 with an agreement covering the development and establishment of the next 8 systems," Science, Industry and Technology Minister Işık said, adding that the Ballistics Visual Analysis and Recognition System (BALICA) developed by Turkey's Scientific and Technical Research Agency (TİTAK) was under way for the sale of the second party.
Light made statements about BALISTICA, developed by the TUBITAK Institute for Space Technology Research.
Light explained that ballistics analysis of the weapons, bullet cores and casings recovered in the incidents helped compare them to the data found in the central database, thus eliminating the problems the ballistics experts encountered while examining the hives and bullet nuclei.
Light said that data and accompanying information obtained from different geographical locations can be questioned by hiding together through BALISTIKA.
Noting that one of the most important features of BALISTICA is the ability to obtain and display three-dimensional data that gives more detail and fewer errors, Light stressed that the system's innovations could speed up the decision made by the ballistics expert, and success has increased greatly.
BALISTICA was exported as part of Project "SUBA-1"
Stressing that BALISTika met all the criteria for success criteria and received a full grade from the Security Directorate, Light noted that the system established in 10 different regions, especially Ankara, covers Turkey.
Expressing that the system was opened abroad as a result of its success, Light reminded that BALISTIKA was exported as part of the "SUBA-1 Project" with Saudi Arabia and was successfully established in six regions in 2013.
The light said another agreement was made for the sale of BALISTika to Saudi Arabia for the second party, and the SUBA-2, which is the continuation of the SUBA-1, was signed, and the deal covering the development and installation of the additional eight systems will increase from 6 to 14 in Saudi Arabia.
A crocodile fossil the size of a bus was found
The prehistoric sea crocodile was reported to have found 10 metres long and 3 tons of weight.
The crocodile's only skull was measured at 1.6 meters long.
Researchers called the species "Machimosaurus rex" and published the findings in the Cretaceous Research magazine.
Federico Fanti, head writer of the article at Bologna University, said that the fossil, apparently 130m years old, was "almost the size of a bus".
Speaking to the Washington Post, Fanti said that the enormous saltwater crocodile "was found at least at the top of the food chain in a specific area at the time".
Paleontologists said M. Rex, thought to be the largest crocodile in the sea, was ambushed in the lagoons.
The largest freshwater crocodile in history is thought to have been the "Sarcosuchus imperator", who lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago and reached 12 metres [12 m] long and eight tons [8 tons].
They're all so confused!
The first 1996 book of author Ece Popeye Kururan was adapted to the theatre under the same name by Aysa Production Theatre, "All Women Are Confused".
Deniz Çakır, Zeynep Kankonde, İpek Turkish Source, Kadir Çermik and Shebnem Sönmez are running the game.
"Poz" and "Ku Hard" are still in play, and for the first time, "Flyer" has had the experience of writing and directing, the game is questioning the confusion in women's minds.
The game met with an audience at Trump Show Center last week.
The game begins with radio theater.
A voice in the dark that brings us back to the past years...
Then the curtain opens.
A woman standing by the window, about to jump down.
It's obvious who he is and why he tried to kill himself, because his next-door neighbors intervened.
HE'S LEAVING A MEDICINE
"Ebru Uysal", played by Sea Cakir, is a popular writer.
Abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
It's been piling up ever since you were a kid.
His lack of fatherly love, the isolation of his student life, the loneliness of childhood, the wrong relationships, the incomprehensibleness of understanding, brought him to this point.
He decided to commit suicide by leaving a letter behind, but he can't jump out the window.
Because the mysterious woman who lives across the street from her next door with her chatty, pure cleaner, Aysel (Zinep Kankonde) keeps her talking.
They're treating it like it's a normal, normal process.
She gets more nervous and can't concentrate and jump.
It turns into a riot when the famous singer, Meltem Kaya (Ipek Turkish Source), who cleaned up his home, attends the conversation between the three of them.
The 'Meltem', who is so naive and sincere about the situation, can't stop singing when he sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt is a different dimension when the real estate agent 'Murat' (Kadir Çermik) enters her house with a spare key.
The singer's misinformation to the press is getting things out of hand.
The game also uses Nazan Prior's "Street Girl" song.
BUNIUM LAUGH
For the first time, the registrar has managed to maintain the pace and flow of the game.
Zeynep Kankonde and Silk Turk are pulling the comedy load.
The caricature types that the duo plays are able to make the audience laugh with their faces and gestures and lines.
Shebnem Sönmez is doing a very good job of conveying the experience of years, while Deniz Cakir is doing a convincing performance in reflecting the depressing mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Tolga Çelik's award-winning film, Kadir Çermik, who speaks of his name in 'Salmaşık', has successfully accompanied these four women.
The one-act play described as a crisis comedy promises to laugh without confusion.
What I remember most of the good things that came out of Perran's mouth, played by Shebnem Sönmez, is that they read to me, they read to me, they read to me, and they saw to me, "Don't play, don't play."
All the kids thought about dying just once to punish their parents, and somehow they always cried.
She's hanging in the air like an obscure joke.
She's always looking for a funny story where she forgets her most important place.
In fact, every story begins with a kind of abandonment.
Sometimes I have to put my hands in my pockets; I can't stand things without pockets.
You never know where to put your hands.
The more surprised we are, the more hands we have.
People talk about what they don't understand, they make it up.
A misunderstanding becomes a reality.
All women are confused because they're confused.
Since you can't manage to die, you have a chance to live.
'Destimate and live long.'
It can be consumed safely at any age
"The protein is more nutritious than yogurt, because it contains the basic minerals and vitamin B," said Specialist Dietist Pınar Rule Enc, who says that milk is the main ingredient but is more useful than milk, but is one of the foods that the miracle kefir is guaranteed to consume at any age."
B1 is rich in vitamin B12 and vitamin K.
With calcium and magnesium content, it forms the foundation of a healthy nervous system.
It's also a good source of phosphorus.
The kelfir, which also has a Tok grip, also doesn't care about weight.
"The food value is very high, and it's an easy drink to digest."
It's a cure for all trouble
Specialist Dietist Pınar Rule Enç, describing children, old people, pregnant women and women entering menopause, who can consume flax without hesitation, said, "Kerfid is a local beverage made in Kafcassia."
But now he's about to announce his name to the world.
The secret of youth, the potion of long and healthy life, is a cure for almost any trouble.
And one of the natural ways to keep babies away from metabolic diseases is that they're incorrigible.
Friend of the bowels
This unique drink, which never stops counting the benefits, is a friend of the bowels.
We've got 1.2 kilograms of bacteria and mushrooms in our intestines.
Microorganisms in the digestive system are also divided into two groups because they are useful and harmful.
Useful microorganisms are called probiotic microorganisms.
The activities of the probiotics are as important as our liver, and when they're consumed enough, they prevent harmful microorganisms in the intestines from sticking to the wall and spreading.
The destabilization of healthy microorganisms in the bowel causes many diseases.
The health of the digestive canal must be maintained in the right way of eating.
And for that, we must certainly consume enough of the probiotics.

Mario Gomez, who has three yellow cards in the Super League, Luiz Rhodolfo and Andreas Beck won't be able to play in a match against Trabzonspor in the 19th week if they see a yellow card in front of the Mersin Academy.
Beşiktaş's leverage, Gomez.
Besiktaş's match with the Mersin Academy will have eyes on German football player Mario Gomez.

The manager's crisis at the Mersin Academy.
The first half of the Super League failed to complete where he wanted it, and the manager's crisis took place during the intermission.
At the Mersin Academy, which completed the first half under the rule of Bulent Korkmaz, roads split with a 48-year-old technical man on the day of the halftime camp.
Hakan Kutlu, who replaced Korkmaz with the red-blues, remained one day in charge of the team he had already run.
During the halftime, an agreement was reached with post-conform manager Nurullah Sağat, but the 50-year-old trainer was only two days behind the team.
Mersin's Training Hall will appear without a manager, since Nurullah Sassik has not yet reached an agreement with a new name.
Sentient letters from little students
A letter from children in the West has been sent to police and soldiers running terrorist operations in Diyarbakır’s central Sur district.
At first, Aksaray 75.
İstanbul West Atahehir Institute of Natural Science and Eskişehir Ataçağ Middle School have launched a coordinated study.
As a result of these studies, the students in the schools printed the choreography of the moon star form on chocolates, and then wrote and painted nearly a thousand letters.
The children then sent their work to Diyarbakır Security Directorate.
Diyarbakır Police Department has set up an exhibition table on the work of children in the west.
The exhibition, founded at the new Security Directorate, included the students' work.
The exhibition was first visited by police officers serving in the Police Department building and citizens who were processing it.
He touched those who read pictures with letters of meaning and poems written by each other.
A student writing a letter about operations in central Sur district said in his letter, “Dear police officers, we are grateful for your sacrifice to protect innocent people in Diyarbakır”.
It's been discovered that the exhibition will last until next week.
She named her daughter Angela Merkel.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been criticised for her policies against refugees, has been named after another refugee baby.
Memun El Hamza, 26, who escaped the war in Syria and managed to reach Duisburg, Germany, and his wife Tema Al Havar, 21, named their first children Angela Merkel.
"We are grateful to be here.
We called our daughter Angela Merkel to show it."
"Germany has become like a mother to us," said Baba Memun Al Hamza.
This is the second 'MERKEL'
The baby Angela Merkel was found born on December 27th.
According to German media reports, the little Angela Merkel, who was born three pounds and three ounces tall, is in good health.
Last year, a Gana refugee named her daughter Angela Merkel, and some refugees opened banners to support Merkel.
Consumer confidence in the United States peaks in seven months
According to university data, the UMICH rose 0.7 points in January compared to the end of December and increased 93.3.
With this result, the market prospects for the index, which recorded its highest level since June 2015, were set at 92.9.
"The consumer trust has moved its rise to the fourth month with the improvement of expectations for future economic growth," Michigan Consumer Research Director Richard Curtin said in a written statement.
"The expectations of individual financing have also maintained its highest level since 2007 because of the general weakness in inflation," he said.
The statement also suggested that consumer optimism would now depend on the fact that inflation remains unusually low.
The UMICH, which recorded its best annual performance last year from 92.9 to 2004, is determined by the results of a 50-question poll conducted every month with at least 500 people.

Putin licks what he spits
Russia prepares to grant Turkish companies the status of "can do business with Russia" if Turkey cannot afford its services any other way, while the Russian Union of Tour Operators said "Russian citizens do not give up on Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which calculated that removing current economic ties with Turkey would cost Russia extra money, has drafted and published a new "Istian situation" draft for the Russian government.
According to the draft published in the Russian Federal Regulatory Fiher, Turkish companies and companies are expected to be allowed to do business with Russia even if necessary.
According to the draft, other sources besides Turkey are impossible to provide, or Turkish companies' products and services can be used if domestic production in Russia costs substantially.
Which Turkish-owned goods and services will be included in this category, and the Russian Ministry for Economic Development will be jointly set up by other relevant ministries.
So it can be decided by the bureaucrats which will allow which Turkish company to work with Russia.
According to the same document, Russia's state-owned and private companies will need to prove to the commission that their work with Turkish partners is not up to date.
If the draft is approved by the Russian government and goes into effect, there will also be a record of privileged Turkish companies in Russia.
Russia's Tour Operators Association said yesterday that Russian citizens have not given up on Turkey.
"Despite the curfew and the Russian Foreign Ministry's recommendation to go to Turkey, our citizens have begun to search for the formula for organizing their holidays alone," the statement said.
On online social networks, the number of articles titled 'The most practical and cheapest way to vacation in Turkey' is booming.
The most common suggestion is to book hotels online and fly with the THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev described the price of oil lowering below $30 as "dramatic" for Russia.
"It was a very bad surprise for our government, as no one thought the oil would go down to $30.
At this rate, it seems the budget will not be able to be carried out as it is now."
It's the last month of 2015 we left behind.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announces further economic sanctions after the plane crash.
In those days, our businessmen, our THY personnel, trying to get to Russia in the usual order, are suffering at the border crossings.
Turkish goods are dragged through customs, subjected to unthinkable control.
It's not much longer than a month ago, and yesterday, Nerdun Hacioglu from Moscow reported it.
One way or another, the sanctions are getting soft.
But why?
The reason is simple.
Because in an era where the economy became so global, the way you closed the border crossings of a century ago, the effort to turn political strife into an economic war is no longer taking off.
Look, we're still writing reports on Iran and how the economic embargo, which has been imposed for years, has been drilled.
Two neighbouring countries, like Russia and Turkey, who seem to have a lot of friends, but are not at all, are actually in need of each other.
It's not technically possible to tear these two countries apart from each other on a night like that.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter each other's countries through chimneys.
It's best to have the political debate on the table and settle it before the sanctions create new Reza Zarrabs.
Without getting the economy involved...
Assault on hotel in Burkina Faso: 20 dead.

Indictees who were transferred to the courthouse following police procedures have been arrested.
Authorities have warned citizens to check their account movements regularly against such incidents and to screen their hands during the code entry at the ATMs.
Netherlands: Assad should be tried in The Hague
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Syrian President Bashar Assad should be tried at the International Criminal Tribunal (UCM) in The Hague.
Speaking at a conference in The Hague, Koenders said it was Assad who was responsible for the refugee raid.
Koenders, who pointed out that peace cannot come to Syria as long as Assad is in power, noted:
Assad must be tried at the UCM in The Hague.
A man with that much blood in his hand must answer to the judgment.
Assad is also responsible for the refugee raid we're facing now.
However, I am aware that Assad will not be leaving his post anytime soon.
This issue needs to be discussed first, and Russia needs help in that context.
Whistling protest against Burak Yilmaz

Then most of the bleachers supported Burak Yilmaz.
Gossip Cauldron: There is no dissonance at Celtic
When Deila admits the Hoops are in a bad place and she'll get over it, Griffith doesn't care about the words of incompatible at Celtic.
The struggle of hearts, the punishment the SFA gave Neilson, and Warburton's shyness in the face of the January signings that broke the team's union.
The lead Dons raise the score to five points with Celtic
ADAM Rooney's first half penalty brought Aberdeen a fair victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, giving the Dons a chance to make a five-point difference between themselves and Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about the word "incompatible."
Griffith has turned his back on rumors of incompatible at Celtic, saying that he and his teammates were not forced by an increased sense of surveillance as they were preparing to meet the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of the Scottish title race bothers the Dutch de Boer
Ronald de Boer, former football player and former international player of the Rangers' midfielder and Dutch football player, says Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they are no longer competing with the Rangers.
De Boer, who is already an Ajax ambassador, said, "Why don't they give you a summary of Celtic matches in Holland anymore?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People don't just talk about the Rangers making a comeback.
They're talking about the old team.
They're talking to the teams together, they're dealing with it.
The tension was high at the old team's games, and it wasn't just the Scots who wanted to watch them.
Deila swore she'd make things right.
RONGY admitted that Deila Celtic was struggling, but the Norwegian boss said that the departure would be reversed.
After defeating Malmö, and soon after farewell to the Champions League, he followed the losing match against Aberdeen of 10, who is now in the lead position of five points in the scoreboard.
But deila said, "Celtic has been through worse in the past, and we will return again."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know it's very disappointing, and I know that a lot of people are angry or upset about what's going on.
We're in the same situation - but we have to keep going.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes these players feel so much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton's inhibition of January transfers
Just a few weeks ago, despite commenting on certain January transfer targets, Ranger's boss, Mark Warburton, hesitates to sign, insisting that Ibrox doesn't want to disrupt his team.
The old Brentford teacher said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For summer players, there's a pre-season period where you can get them used to, and we've seen it in our group this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes it hurts more to add needless players to what you really need.
He's targeting Celtic Michu for retirement
One of the Swansea strikers, Michu, was connected to Celtic at the transfer window, and when his contract with the Swans ended, his visions of retirement failed.
When he was 29 years old, he had two years of excruciating pain from a troubled ankle, and he couldn't find a way out of Wales in the summer.
Hearts prepare for the battle of SFA on Neilson's comments
When Paterson got kicked out of the game, the Hearts were 2-1, and then they lost 3-2, the defender's red card turned everything upside down, and Collum's third red card to be canceled in eight months.
Neilson won't give up on what he said, he keeps insisting, "I've never questioned the Union, I haven't commented on the performance."
Griffiths tried to stop Tynecastle.
Obsessed Hibee was scolded when he sang a song about former Hearts actor Rudi Skacel, which contained offensive words.
The incident occurred in March 2014 at a bar in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh, prior to the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle.
"It was a derby match, and it had the heat of the moment," said the offense player. "I can say for sure that from now on, I will not go to Tynecastle except to play with Celtic.
The Tannadice board trusts the Dundee United administration - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly still has confidence that the board of directors of the Dundee United will make things right -- but they agree that the decline in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the kids ready to go again," Donnelly said.
Mclness is happy with the "ugly winning" against Hamilton.
Derek Mclness admits that thanks to the first half penalty of Aberdeen team Adam Rooney, they had to hold on desperately to Hamilton Accies in order to see Celtic's seventh consecutive wins, which led them to the top five points in the league.
Mclnnes said, "There is no winning team in the middle, whether it's trophies or leagues, without winning a game like this."
As unemployment rates rise in England, the proportions among the Scots remain the same.
The number of unemployed people throughout England increased to 1.82 million in Scotland, while employment remained unchanged between May and July 164,000.
According to the National Statistics Office (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was higher than 5.9 per cent and 5.5 per cent in Britain.
On the other hand, employment in Scotland has dropped by 12,000 in three months, and the current number of employees is 2,62,000.
The employment rate for Scotland has dropped to 74.0 per cent -- above the average 73.5 per cent in Britain.
"The government's long-term plan laid the foundations of a stronger economy," Scotland's Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures.
It's been almost a full year since Scotland decided to remain a part of England.
In these 12 months, we've seen improvements in the Scottish labour market by increasing employment and lower unemployment.
Why am I a Witness of an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, I'm going to watch a man get killed due to a late legal intervention.
I hope not, but if it does, I'm gonna sit in the death row gallery at Oklahoma State Prison while Richard Glossip is being executed with a lethal injection.
He wanted me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The first invitation was through his best friend in January, and as shocked as I was, I accepted.
The closer that day got, the more scared I was.
So why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death sentence.
It will offer a unique perspective.
Right, journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and as they decide who gets elected rather than where there's more practice, a terrible lottery emerges.
Oklahoma has reduced media seats from 12 to 5.
Whoever gets elected will watch without feeling it.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed a relationship with him over the past months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison officials said I couldn't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be given a pen and a notebook to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
A Oklahoma journalist accused me of compromising my neutrality via Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes it, gain access.
I complained to him.
And he agreed that he could say it better, but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip disagrees with me in some of the things I said and wrote.
He won't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime he wanted.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write it down.
He thinks if he dies, it'll help the anti-death penalty movement.
A reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware, will be with me.
If you'd like to know more about this, please listen to the podcast series I've prepared.
I'm not going to go over all the details here again.
I have no idea Richard Glossip is innocent.
What Barry Van Treese did after his death was enough to make him an accomplice.
But I still believe he's not guilty of murder.
I believe there is absolutely no evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm going to watch him die with that perspective.
I can't claim to be objective.
You can look at the other reporters there for that.
The impressions you'll get from me will be that you'll get from someone who's watching the death of a man who's been killed unnecessarily.
He was convinced of the Canning River after a wet police chase.
Canning Vale, the police officer, convinced the man to leave the Canning River and stayed dry.
The claim to escape from a police car behind a man from Perth ended with an attempt by a police officer to "conceive himself gently back to shore" in shallow, muddy water.
The Canning Vale police were called in Tuesday for breaking and entering in Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, he broke into the Canning River and tried to escape the police.
But he didn't get far.
"Secretary Sergeant Shandell Castledine stood in the water and said, 'I won't go out, come and get me.'"
Police Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiation".
Senior Sergeant Castledine said, "Sometimes people try funny things to try to escape."
The champion football player Ben Cousins provides a catchy example.
In 2006, a cop left his car to avoid alcohol control and tried to swim across the Swan River.
Their efforts failed, but it inspired the locals to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon as a joke.
Peter Moody claimed that the butlers ratted him out and threatened him to quit the race.
Peter Moody claimed that last year the Racing Victoria butlers tried to prepare a plot in their stables and threatened him to leave the race immediately.
Racing Victoria targeted the stewards and the unity department, and said that they were campaigning against her to throw Lady Tatai out of the race in the final baiting Wednesday before the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do the best in the race, and that when it came to the cobalta, he found himself in difficult circumstances he couldn't explain himself.
He said he'd been biting his tongue for 18 months in the face of allegations of snitching, and he didn't want to look like "drinky grapes".
"I wasn't going to say any of this, and I covered it up for a long time, but sometimes you get so angry, and it happens all of a sudden," said Moody.
They know it's going on.
Sometimes you react, and you suffer the consequences, and I will suffer the consequences of what I say.
I'll sleep well when I get home tonight.
I want to walk around with my head held high, and I want my bosses to know that I'm trying my best for them.
When they start to think I didn't do it, it means I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
I'd think about what I'd do with my license.
Before, Moody set off a bomb in an interview with a racing.com, accusing the unit department of being a snitch in his own barn.
"Twenty months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - if asked, I would name him - and they offered him a job in my stables in exchange for telling them what I was doing in the stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a crook.
If that's the case, they all have to return their coats because they weren't talented enough to catch me.
The former head of the RVL, Robert Roulston, the new head of the RVL, David Moodie, and the current CEO of the RVL, they knew that then and now.
Does that make me think it's getting personal?
The RVL has a series of balls, and maybe it wants to make everyone but the trainers responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and kick me out, but I have no doubt what I'm saying will make them think.
But where I come from, I don't care about anything, and it makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I'm gonna put pressure on them, put them in charge of making decisions.
I have my family's support and I walk away.
His disappointment over the long-standing cobalt investigation involving the trainer Lidari and his next scratch made him feel "put my tongue across the table".
The undefeated champion, Moody, who won the fame of preparing the Black Caviar, described the race day maintenance rule as "funny", stating that it is against the rules to put mud or clay porridge on the horse's feet.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this."
One of my men accidentally put the mud on his foot.
He could have had it last night.
He could have had it yesterday, which he did.
It's race day.
Moody may face a three-month ban for using porridge in race day care as a result of an investigation by executives.
This is a joke.
Those who make those rules know nothing about a horse.
"We understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
The hit-and-run driver was arrested in Cobram.
The police arrested the guy who ran off on a bicycle in Cobram this weekend.
The cyclist was taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital Saturday morning after a car hit him on Murray Valley Highway due to serious injuries.
Police said the hit driver escaped the scene without helping the wounded.
On Monday, a 50-year-old Natalia man surrendered to a police station in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping in an accident, not helping and other traffic crimes.
A 40-year-old Cobra cyclist remains stable at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responded harshly to his opponents' claims about wrestling.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy described criticism targeting his team as an effort to create a "daytime" for the NRL's two favorite winners.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson told me that Friday night at the semifinals in Sydney, they let judges "fight" with their own team in a match Storm was defeated in.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett gave Storm a non-disclosure reference after a semifinal game against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, describing it as a "disgusting" match for the rugby league, and said the two Oueenslands were not "too big" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's struggle and said they were only focused on "themas" when they were fighting.
Bellamy said that he was encouraged by criticism from two leading teachers to his team because it meant they were worried that Storm would beat them.
This is going on -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson mention wrestling when they beat us 24-2, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or our techniques all year long, just in the last six weeks, we've made a real emphasis on our combat contacts, and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and obviously there's a big team he's been teaching, and he's probably not used to losing with a little shock for himself.
It's funny how this happened this time of year.
Bellamy opposed Bennett's idea of exciting football, which reminded him of Bennett's teacher, who won the 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons' first place playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
On Saturday night, he made it a matter of comparing his games to our Friday night game, and how exciting their match was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 when St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he wouldn't give me a rat's ass.
But now they've got a football team that we can call exciting football, especially with their speed and their young half.
That's the kind of football you want to play when you have players like this.
In 2010, he put it this way, and now he wants everyone to play football like this -- not every team has halfs like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play like this.
It gives me more confidence because even they are afraid to play.
They probably didn't remember us six weeks ago when they went to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Roosters match had a higher score than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, but I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score?
Our game is 20 to 18, and both sides score more in our match, but this is exciting football?
Or is it exciting to stop the attacks, but not to do the score-breakers?
That's the agenda for me.
If they're talking about us, that means we'll meet them here in the next phase.
Storm, one of the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks won their first final game on Tuesday because he won the right to host at AAMI Park on Saturday night.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail on drug charges
The man who was smuggled into Queensland on 40 kilograms of cocaine and was facing a possible life sentence was released on bail for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five people captured last month by the federal police who tracked the 100kg of drugs from South America via Vanuatu and landed at the port in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen at a meeting with his accomplices at the marina this morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where police found 40 kilos of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Although Maksimovic's lawyer said he may have been facing a potential life sentence for possession of commercial amounts of cocaine, he said there is no evidence that he attempted to have all the drugs and may be in the café for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk.
They have an open connection to Serbia.
He travels frequently to Serbia," he said in court Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he was staying in the public case.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather offered him $200,000 to bail him out.
"It is clear that after reading sworn statements from both people, the bail price of $200,000 is literally a financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
However, he warned that it was not enough alone to prevent him from taking the case.
Maksimovic was released on bail, in exchange for delivering both Australian and Serbian passports, going to the police station every day and following a curfew between 6am and 6 am.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to lure pedophiles to send video.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was asleep, logged into an online messaging service, providing him with a series of inappropriate children's images sent to him by another user.
Then she woke up and realized she didn't have a phone, and she found her phone in the hands of sleeping Hogg.
He looked at her and immediately noticed disturbing messages before warning his mother.
The police were interested and saw five pictures, then analyzed the computers found at the address, and discovered "interested" web searches using terms for finding inappropriate children's images.
Hogg later claimed that he did this to officers to "manage and scare" the pedophiles on the Internet.
"He said it's an addiction -- an addict who scares people.
He admitted the calls were made by the computer, but said he did it to scare pedophiles, to act like a police officer.
Questions were asked about meetings with him who asked him to send more pictures with the unknown person who sent them.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said that when he drank, he got sick ideas and wanted to watch videos of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When she found the messages on her phone, she called out to her mother screaming and trembling and crying.
The mother saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone, and the charges came after her.
The girl was interviewed, and she said she used computers and PlayStation to look younger than the defendant was.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives in Ward Road, Dundee, was found guilty of buying or producing inappropriate children's paintings on June 14th, violating bail on January 25th of this year and failing to appear in court on March 24th this year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim said that Hogg should not be included in the category of sexual crimes because there may be no "clear sexual element" in this crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the case until October, when the social history report will be filed.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was kept on probation for other unusual cases.
He was registered for sexual crimes prior to the date of his sentence.
Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest leader in Africa, fell down the stairs earlier this year, coming down a runway.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was tarnished by opposition MPs claiming that they had received anonymous death threats if they booed him during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
In his address to the nation in parliament last month, they booed him and interrupted him repeatedly -- he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, leader of the Democratic Movement for Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received messages on their cell phones so that they would not disturb him during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"After Mr. Mugabe's speech is over, the message comes from a number that does not appear to journalists, but the title is 'death'," he said.
He says their immunity is valid within parliament and that immunity does not work when they leave parliament.
The party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "worried" by threats against politicians, chief spokesman said.
Hewlett-Packard will cut 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard will end 25,000 to 30,000 jobs, with efforts to rebuild and reduce costs in corporate services.
The HP will be divided into two companies listed later this year, separating computer and printer work from faster-growing equipment and service operations.
HP reported that the expected layoffs would result in an expense of around $2.7 billion at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
"These reconstruction activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable expense structure for the new Hewlett Packard Corporation," said Meg Whitman, president and executive head of the HP, who will head the post-separation unit.
"Whitman, the Hewlett Packard Corporation will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a large and deep portfolio to help companies move into their new business style," he said.
As a separate company, we're in a much better position to provide for our clients worldwide.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Corporation's annual income will be over $50 billion and will focus on providing "integrated technology solutions" for companies.
His garages in Palo Alto are called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley" and are divided into two parts by Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s to build electrical equipment.
HP is undergoing a massive reorganization to cope with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
HP, one of the world's largest PC manufacturers and one of the US's largest technology companies, is one of the latest moves in the industry in the belief that firms with strict focuses perform better.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that Wilshere suffered problems with his teammates before the Dinamo Zagreb match.
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's injury took place in September and that his treatment was planned and that there was no reason why he shouldn't play around Christmas.
The best-case scenario already means Wilshere is going to miss at least four games in England, and given his history, it's unclear whether he'll be attending the European Championship next summer.
The most embarrassing thing about the last problem is that Wilshere had a bad ankle injury, and then he had a strong finish last season, and then he had to search for his previous sharpness before the season.
This type of injury isn't threatening his career, Wenger said.
This is a bone that's not fully healed.
It's no big deal.
It was just an accident.
This has nothing to do with his wrists or his previous injuries.
Well, in a medical perspective, that may be true, but as Wenger would agree, there is also the danger of further injury for an actor who returns mid-season.
There's also a disturbing pattern developing.
According to the research conducted by Ltd, Primer Injuries had 23 different diseases recorded since the beginning of Wilshere six years ago.
He played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
Arsenal has been one of two First League teams that have often lost due to injury in six seasons since 2007–08.
Wenger accepts the potential for a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believes that the record of injury last season will continue to improve.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you experience an open period of injury, a process where you want to strengthen your body and win the fight," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to pull this off.
I hope his body stabilizes, I trust, and I believe he'll make the career he deserves.
He has Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in front of Arsenal, which will start the Champions League fight against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, and will play next Wednesday, preparing the Wenger team for them.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't go to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will play.
Wenger can replace Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud.
"I'm trying to protect the regime and give the players what they need," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is an open favourite of Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most feared stadiums.
Dinamo hasn't been beaten for 41 games since last season after he produced his own undefeated campaign.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale Tuesday night.
This is the 10th quake in Zagreb this year.
He believes Wenger Arsenal learned the necessary lesson last season in defeating Monaco in the Champions League, and continues to motivate the club with its remote goal of achieving its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is enormous," says Wenger.
It's never been like this in Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have the experience to be realistic.
We're passionate, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The comedy program that teaches us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar portals in the programs is remarkable, especially when men need more to open up, and suicide rates among young men are at the height of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the main cause of male deaths between the ages of 20 and 45, and it was three times the size of men compared to women.
To draw attention to this problem, the Poor Against Life Campaign (CALM) has declared 2015 a Man's Year and aims to oppose the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
In order to accomplish this difficult task, friendship is at the center of the struggle.
A study by a high school student who experienced more than 2,000 depressed symptoms showed that if the sufferer had a high number of "healthy" friends, their chances of recovery have doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends cuts down on mental challenges that can arise.
But of course, in order for friendship to work, it has to be accessible first.
In this age of social media-based communication, the focus of style rather than content makes immediate response rather than meaningful communication a priority.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look like powerful, fun-loving, successful people, even if it's really all insulation.
The concepts of artificial success, which psychologists call external-intuitive values, money, image, under the sovereignty of social status, follow by internal values that have a deeper impact on our mental health -- our inner longing for personal development and friendship -- are going to waste.
As a billionaire video game creator recently explained, money does not buy more happiness.
The beauty of Friends was to turn this focus upside down.
Characters weren't defined by their work, but by their personality, and they showed that by their interaction with their friends.
Joey and Chandler's hugs, watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross' contact with Rachel, they all came from the knowledge that they could actually relate to them, even if they stayed in the background to fully explain how men feel.
What a helpful employee tells me is that when I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I've seen how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference.
Most of the guys who contact us can't talk to their friends.
It's a strong feeling of "passing through," and the idea of opening up to others is a sign of weakness.
When I suggest long-term coping mechanisms, one of the programs I can think of is Friends.
He emphasized the small moments of male friendship.
As my goal is, a foreign status on the phone helps people when they're in trouble, but long-term support comes from close personal networks, family and friends.
And if you're joining FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful setting where the scenes are being redeployed for celebration?
Or, better yet, if you see anyone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You have no idea what a difference your friendship will make.

Di Maria scored a goal that made it easier for PSG to defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edison Cavani after his goal to Malmö.
At the start of the Champions League, Angel Di Maria made it easier for the PSG to beat his opponent with a goal for the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the match.
In the goal of Angel Di Maria and Edison Cavani, Paris started the Saint-Germain Champions League on Tuesday with a 2-0-plus win against Malmö at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes ago, allowing the French champion to move on to the Champions League, but in 61 minutes, they failed to seize the opportunity until Cavani's second head goal.
Paris, which was with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, not only to get out of qualifying groups, but also to improve their quarterfinal performances in the last three championships.
But when they scored, the game they played for Laurent Blanc's team was not the best game of the era, Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of positions around the penal court, and was later benched against the team of his country, where he began his glorious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win whether we're in the Champions League or out, winning 2-0 in this respect will create problems for our competitors, and while there are some things we need to improve during the season, it's a good start to give a comfortable look back," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
Even though I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals, we wanted to win, and we won.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to Paris in the fourth minute, under Di Maria's shadow in one of the three changes in the 2-2 match against Bordeaux in the 1st League.
When the Argentine winger was transferred from Manchester United last month, he was viewed as a player who would take the PSG to a higher level in Europe, and Marco Veratti's pass behind Malmö's pass, and showed that it was not wrong for those who felt this way when he sent Johan Wiland from the far corner to the nets.
Everyone, however, was disappointed while waiting for the PSG to win a great victory.
Malmö, who eliminated Celtic at the playoffs off, was lined up in the field with nine international players, a five-man defense and two midfielders, a heavy opponent.
In the 34th minute, Nikola Djurdjic had a very few attacks, except for a shot at the corner of Kevin Trapp's guard.
On the other hand, the PSG gave them the opportunity to slow down the game with unnecessary passes and inefficient final strokes, and during the first half, Ibrahimovic failed to make a final move in at least five attacks, and when the second half began, he failed to keep up with Cavani's game.
However, when he came to organize his colleagues, he showed that he was more skilled, and in the 52nd minute, Ibrahimovic was the one who passed the curveball shot that Di Maria sent to Wiland's castle.
The second goal came after a full hour's run, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan player recorded his sixth goal in the season with Maxwell's left-wing head after Ibrahimovic's pass.
Malmö ran out of ideas that Malmö would go back to the game, and after the goal that Ezequiel Lavezzi entered the game, which was not considered an informal goal, Wiland saved David Luiz's shot in the empty position perfectly and refused to let the score change.
Later, Malmö coach Age Hareide admitted that the PSG had a class advantage over his own team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League match was in December of last year."
Since then, we've only played ball in the Swedish League, which is not at the same level as him.
The elimination teams aren't enough.
There's a hat on Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion in stock sales.
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore was struck by the price of processed goods falling, and he made $2.5 billion selling his shares on Wednesday as part of his plan to divide his debts.
Glencore, listed in London, announced that he sold a new stock worth £1.6 billion to pay off his debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, has been seriously affected by the price of goods falling because China's economic slowdown has caused a rise in demand and caused turmoil in the markets.
The issue of rights caused Glencore's stock prices to rise on the London Stock Exchange early Wednesday morning.
The shares increased by 0.69 per cent higher in the FTSE 100 index and increased by 2.77 per cent to 131.60p.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale plan, which was part of their plan to reduce the 30 billion debt stack by a third.
The company sold new stocks for 125p per share, which was 2.4 per cent off, compared to Tuesday's closing.
He sold 1.3 billion shares, equivalent to 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about China's long-standing growth cut iron ore prices roughly half way; coal, copper and other goods fell between 20 and 40 percent.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
On Tuesday, the White House confirmed that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi's first official visit to Washington would take place on September 25th, and was a return visit to Barack Obama, who arrived in Beijing last November, the statement said.
Following the bilateral talks of the two heads of state, US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will give a dinner in honor of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan.
The statement also stressed that "President Xi's visit would extend US-Chinese co-operation on both countries, as well as regional and global issues, and allow President Obama and President Xi to deal constructively with disputes".
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit some US tech leaders before Washington and then move to New York City to join the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss some controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about allegations that China is conducting cyber espionage activities and China's claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon makes the diversity of filmmaking seem insignificant.
Matt Damon opposed African-American filmmaker Effie Brown, saying that it was not necessary to be behind the camera during a debate on diversity.
In the HBO Project Greenlight Sunday night episode, Brown emphasized the need for alternative perspectives on the black main character in the selected script, while the experienced actor interrupted.
Damon, when we talk about diversity, you do it in the cast of the film, not the cast of the show.
Shocked, Brown reacted against it with comments from the actor of the Martian film, saying, "Uh-huh. Okay.
Damon and Brown were brought together by co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
Brown first said, "I wanted to make people think about how they're going to treat Adaptian character, no matter who the director is."
The only black character is a hooker shot by a white pimp.
Dear White People's publisher insisted on finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to direct the film.
After the debate was released, there was an explosion of dissatisfaction with Damon's comments on social media.
Twitter user MrPooni wrote, "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so the diversity of this person can be explained as painfully."
After tweet was sent, he received 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments came at a time when the right racial expression in the media was at the forefront of social debate.
After being killed by a young white police officer named Michael Brown in 2014, the move on Black Life was effective across the country, encouraging lawmakers and authorities to stop discrimination against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince spoke in a covert way about the move as the Grammy Awards nominated for Album of the Year candidates were introduced.
He said the albums are still important.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Life Act issued a statement against Elisabeth Hasselbeck, an important figure at Fox News, asking whether the group should be considered a hate group.
The leaders said, "The Black Life Is Important. The Network is a love group."
It was recently announced that Damon was invited to visit the Pope to discuss the description of the Catholic Church in the West, including performers, producers and media patrons.
It is not yet clear whether he has accepted the invitation or whether he has met with the Pope.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns his first champion.
Professional rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldio was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior program Monday night and win the $1 million prize.
This competition, which entered season seven, had never seen a contestant who could complete every step of the obstacle course.
In the season final, Caldio and Geoff Britten made it to the final round.
The last mission was to climb a 20-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete this course in time, so he succeeded in becoming the first athlete to complete the tough fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero won this course three seconds before him.
After this tough win, Caldio spoke to E.News in shock of winning the $1 million grand prize.
Isaac told E! "I think it's wonderful to even think about it, I've never made more than $10,000 a year or made a living," he told E!
I mean, it just happened... I can't imagine what it would be like... the future.
The producer Kent Weed met with The Hollywood Reporter and explained why there would be no reward, even though Britten was the first contestant to finish the course.
According to the rules, money is given to the fastest.
"Anyone who finishes more than one will win the prize which makes it the fastest," Weed said.
Even though money was a great prize and life changed, he also won a huge bonus.
I don't think he has a bad idea about it.
He's so happy he did what he did.
He got tons of credit from his fans.
He's a great man and a family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff told me, "I'm glad it's Isaac if anyone's gonna beat me."
I think Isaac would have thought the same thing if his roles had changed.
The American Ninja Warrior has renewed the contract for season eight, and the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers just crossed the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- The Detroit Tigers didn't have much fun the second half of the season.
The Tigers, once one of the best in baseball, are now in the last place of the American Central League.
The Tigers, who reduced their game to corruption, managed to beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins lost its chance of reaching the American Second League wild card by crossing the half-point gap between him and the Houston Astros.
For Detroit, even for one night, the situation was a return to a good game that was rarely seen in most of the second half of the season.
In the words of Brad Ausmus, the manager of the Tigers, "All victories are pleasant in any way."
The Tigers' pitcher, Alfredo Simon, managed to score a goal in the sixth and ninth pitch, with Detroit scoring three times in the first two.
Simon (13-9) scored six 3/1 strokes, three of which were running.
That was only the third quality start of his last nine tours.
"I just want to close the year strong," Simon said.
It's hard for the backups to waste every game, so I wanted to dive deep into the game.
Victor Martinez, the Tigers' chosen batter, made three runs, and two were the first RBI to win since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hitter night since his four-hit against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He shook the bat hard," said Ausmus.
He seemed to be doing well (in batting practice), and he was already doing much better at BP, which he did in the game.
At the end of the seventh inning, Twins has the best chance of getting back in the game.
Middle fielder Byron Buxton has started the batting line by making a double on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks only made one slow shot, and Simon caught second baseman BrianDozier swinging for Blaine Hardy, left-handed.
Mauer, the only player who could stand up to Miguel Sano, who passed Drew VerHagen in two - the right-winger.
In the second tie run, VerHagen and a couple of runners managed to get third baseman Trevor Plouffe in a double game.
Plouffe's hit on DP for the 27th time in the big leagues this season.
After Detroit tried to make a run for ninth place, Mauer crossed the RBI and made a stand-off with the Tigers and made 5-4 and approached Bruce Rondon.
However, he was caught in Sano in three strikes for the right-handed fifth rescue.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes' early release.
The Tigers have won three runs in their first two pitches against experienced right-handed players who have been away from the field for over a month due to back burn.
"This is obviously not the game I want to play," Hughes said, "but then I felt more comfortable and managed to make some pretty good pitches in the third round."
Once he had a successful shot, Hushes took second baseman Ian Kinsler out of the game.
The second outning of right fielder J.D. Martinez left Victor Martinez alone in the first run of the match.
Victor Martinez competed with the runners to beat the 0-21 band in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single shot to the right, winning another run, but Victor Martinez wanted to do the third, and the threats ended.
The Tigers added in the second, a couple of outfielders from catcher James McCann, and one or two-outs from midfielder Anthony Gose, making the situation 3-0.
Paul Molitor, the Twins' manager, said it was a big hit.
He didn't hit it very well, but he threw it in the right place.
Hughes scored three shots that didn't score until he was replaced with A.J. Achter, the right-handed savior.
Hughes has been charged with three runs and four infallible strokes in six strokes.
Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez is out of the game because of the pain in his shoulder.
He'll be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez' shoulder surgery in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been listed for shoulder pain since mid-August, is scheduled to start working Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, LHP Daniel Norris will start with the DL.
Since the July 30th match for David Price's transfer, Norris and the Tigers have been 1-1 in four games.
He hasn't played since August 20th because of the pain on the right side.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), Minnesota RHP, will compete with Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open the economy to the world more.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with managing reforms that the economy needs to open more to speed up growth.
"China must develop opening policies by drawing foreign investment expertise," he said at the 16th Central Front Group meeting to strengthen General Reforms.
As Xi encouraged the opening, he said new reforms would bring new energy and vitality and create a new area for economic growth.
The group adopted a series of proposals, such as the negative list that regulates market access, loosening border control policies, encouraging the state-owned institutions to include private capital, and revising the registration system of residents.
A negative list of banned sectors and jobs will be drawn up for investment, according to the statement.
The system will be tested phase by stage and developed by test programs.
This is an important move, because it will give the market a greater role in allocation of resources, and it will make the market more open by providing a law-based business environment.
At the same time, the government will loosen its control over companies and allow companies to run their own business.
It also says that China will study new cross-border economic co-operation models in border regions and that new mechanisms will be activated to encourage regional growth.
More space will be opened to private investment to open sectors controlled by the state.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment, and it will offer better services to foreign-funded companies by protecting their interests," the statement said.
In addition, the requirements for foreigners to obtain permanent residence permits or "green card" will be optimised and the application process will be facilitated by taking a path.
It also discussed guaranteeing the rights of lawyers to practice and raising professional judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli attended the meeting, according to a statement released after the meeting.
The miniature bag is now very fashion-time paper Friday's Eki
In the fashion world, the roads go round and round to the bags.
The current that's recently come forward is the miniatures...
It's safe to say that the little bags attached to the adults also draw attention.
They say the little ones are beautiful.
I guess that goes for the bags, too.
When I could barely get enough of the bags to walk the streets, the wind started to blow in the opposite direction and the bags began to shrink.
We already had the little bags, but this time they came up with the size of their large handbags reduced.
You can only fit your phone, credit card and key into these tiny bags.
The current that started with Céline and Hermès spread through Prada.
The miniature curiosity of bag worship has also affected new models.
Loewe presented the fun bags he's prepared this season in two sizes.
From pandas, polar bears and elephant-shaped bags, the most elephant-looking ones come forward.
The size of the large bags, which the luxury brands offer with the phenomenon of names, seem to attract the most red carpet celebrities.
The Birkin bag Hermes prepared for Jane Birkin is one of the most preferred.
Although Jane Birkin said she didn't want her name mentioned in a press release with a bag, but that's how it's in the memory now.
Fashion weeks have made the mini-bag flow mass.
And on the runways, the mini-bags come forward.
They're pretty tiny, so you can't really wear them on your arm.
They can be used cross-referenced with long hangers.
But on the runways, we saw those long hangers wrapped around the ankles of models.
Fendi's the one who's taking the mini-bag thing to the next level.
He has a suggestion for those who can't fit into the mini-bag, but who can't give up on them.
Friend mini-bags for big bags.
How?
By turning the mini-bags into a bag ornament that can be attached to the adults.
This presentation on the runways is rapidly paying off on the street.
Let's see what else we can see!
Skin change in the den.
Turkey is in a position to compete with world brands on denim.
He's enriching his production experience with design now.
Loft's one of them.
We see black models, which used to be a few, are now starting to take place on the shelves every season.
In the season that blacks rise so high, the experiment has found their best friend.
Skin fragments and detailed designs emerge as rebel friends of denim.
Short models with zippers, generally called "motorbike," are on the agenda.
While the strong air of the skin is still complete by black pieces, chiffon long blouses, glittering sweatshirts provide an elegant view of sports.
Young people used to wear clothes and want to get lost in the crowd.
It was supposed to save the day.
Now young people want to carry on a piece that emphasizes style as well as comfort.
From this angle, it's possible to say that Loft understood the target mass correctly with collections and complementary parts.
Little step for Banksy, big step for "global."
The world premiere of the collection of "The Art of Banksy", which brought together the works of the mysterious street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
The exhibition of the artist's 15 years of work, the first exhibition of the Global Karaköy Building, where 85 original works came together for the first time.
Mysterious street artist Bansky's first exhibition in Istanbul opened the day before yesterday in Global Karaköy (Sport Street).
The world-renowned artist who hid his identity and used his undersecretary name, of course, wasn't at the opening.
We don't know if he's been to Istanbul.
But Steve Lazaridas, the curator of the exhibit, says Bansky doesn't even know about this exhibit.
There's no reason to ask her permission.
Because the old friend, Bansky and Lazaridas, left after 12 years.
Some of the exhibits were collected by Lazaridas and some from collectors.
But there are things that the Bansky followers are curious about.
What would Banksy think of the exhibition of "The Art of Banksy" where 85 of his works were put together?
What would he say if he saw the small store at the end of the 800 square meter gallery?
Would Red Balloon Girl, Cleaner, Rose say that the world’s wounded subjects were printed on cloth bags, wallets, necklaces?
It's disappointing for Banksy's followers that the exhibition of an anarchist artist who hides his identity has become such a commodity.
That's not Banksy's style.
But you still get the limited number of tickets before they run out!
For Banksy, the great exhibition for the small, globalized world can be seen until April of "The Art of Banksy".
They're mean, they're cruel.
Why don't you go dig a ditch?
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has continued his reaction to academics signing the declaration.
"These are cruel, these are low."
Verily those who are with the wrong-doers are wrong-doers.
He said, "They committed the same crime because they were with the murderers."
"In this act in Sultanahmet Square, a peace square that smells like history and civilization, and in the vicinity of the German Fountain, I also shared our regrets with the German Chancellor and the German Chancellor for the death of 10 German friends in such a region.
I want to express my condolences to all the German people, first to the families of those who have died."
"Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination," he said.
Erdogan, who continues his reaction to the academics signing the declaration, said: "I especially condemn, I strongly condemn the academics who have issued a black declaration against all these terrorist incidents and signed the signature under those massacres."
Just because our nation understands who is who, a professor, a professor in front of it, doesn't make anyone intellectual.
These are dark people.
These are they who are the wrong-doers, the vilest of them all.
They committed the same crime because they were with the massacrers.
Now, in the incident at the Cýnar, where would these dark academics put the three-year-old Mevlüde, who died with her father?
How do they fit their conscience to stand next to his killers?
I call upon all the judicial authorities, the senate of the universities, for these actions contrary to our constitution and laws.
Yesterday, I told him that the steps needed to be taken must be taken quickly.
And whatever they're going to do, they're going to do it there.
Those who want to make politics, let them make politics in parliament.
But if they can't do it in Parliament, let them go and dig a ditch or climb a mountain.
I'm being very clear.
TEOG results have been released

The score is done at 700 points.
The main score for placement is: 6th and 8th grade success points and 8th grade weighted exam points.
The total is divided into two and you get a prime point for placing it.
The score is 500 points.
Marking the doors of the faculty members
Some of the professors at Gazi University Faculty of Communications have been posted on the room door saying, "We don't want it in our university... that supports the PKK."
Under the paper is the "Gazi Communications" sign.
The 1128 academics who signed the declaration entitled “We Will Not Be a Part of this Crime” by the group “Academy for Peace Initiative” had received numerous reactions, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and government officials.
The academics who were investigated for their signature have been taken into custody and suspended from duty.
At the University of Gazi Communications School, some of the professors were posted on the door saying, "We don't want it in our university... that supports the PKK."
Under the paper, the sign of "Gazi Communications..." was added.
At least 14 people were killed and 27 injured in a rock-rolling tour bus in the mountainous region in Nagano, Japan.

The Cessik Beaten is on its last journey
Celine Dion lost her husband.
The wife of Canadian singer Celine Dion, René Angélil, died.
At age 12, Angéllil discovered Dion's talent and married in Montreal in 1994.
After Angéllil was diagnosed with cancer in 1999, Celine Dion took a break from her career.
'I found 26 people looking for two wrestlers.'
Mete Gumurhan's second documentary, "Young Pehlivans", 66.
The Berlin Film Festival (February 11–21) was the first Turkish documentary to be selected for "Generation L Plus".
Gumurhan, originally Edirnei but a production company in Holland, explained why and how he filmed his documentary in the summer of 2014.
The film "Young Pehlivans", which tells the story of six Amasian boarding school students who aim to become world champions in wrestling, will compete in the Berlin Film Festival episode "Generation Kplus".
Young Pehlivans, the first Turkish-made documentary selected for this episode, are one of the candidates for the Crystal Bear award.
Born and raised Dutch, but originally Edirneian director Mete Gümurhan.
When he was a kid, he used to come to Turkey on summer holidays and listen to his grandfather's greasy wrestling stories and watch the competition.
"There are not only political problems in Turkey."
I wanted to tell the world what else happened in Anatolia.
"For example, wrestling from our ancestral sports is not known, unfortunately," he wants to come together with six directors and do a documentary project.
This project will be inconclusive, but one day, the magazine news he reads on the plane opens the door to another project for Gumurhan.
'We camped at the sugar factory.'
The 10-11-year-old wrestler, Mete Gumurhan, who followed the article about two younger brothers, goes to Samsun, where the family lives.
Kids' dads don't let them shoot for the documentary.
"I've been thinking about what I can do all day.
Because support from the Ministry of Culture could have been withdrawn."
Dad was talking about a boarding school in Amasya where the kids were going.
I thought I'd go there.
When I was looking for two kids, I met 26 kids at school who were interested in wrestling.
We started filming in a week and finished the permits.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We camped in the sugar factory dorm."
The biggest challenge that the documentary produced in three weeks was to the director was language.
"I didn't know what to expect when I was doing it."
"They didn't speak Turkish either," he says.
Young Paddlers focus on the story of six out of 26 children wrestlers.
Baran, who was raised by his grandfather and had a weight problem, couldn't participate in training because he broke his arm, Aaron, ambitious but in health problems, Bethlehem, the school's lovely kid, Umur, the youngest champion, Ahmet, and Muhammad, who held the band together...
Mete Gumurhan explains his work with the children: "I left them completely natural."
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I shot for the first week and a half at practice.
What I wanted was for the kids to pretend there were no cameras.
"Thank God they got used to it quickly."
It's a surprise to be elected to Berlin.
"We had prepared, but it was a surprise that we were elected to Berlin," Mete Gumurhan said, saying he did not expect the young Pajavans to be elected to the Berlin Film Festival.
Young Pehlivans are not a sports documentary, they're a film that tells about children's struggles and tells them about their lives.
"I wanted to bring up stories of children with family problems who are able to identify themselves and deal with their problems," he says.
Support for academics from the art world
Following the declaration of "Academias for Peace Initiative", the storm was launched yesterday as an investigation into academics and a series of support statements are being made.
The first aid came from literary writers, including many famous names.
The other day the filmmakers and the theatre people announced their support.
"We, the artists who work in theatre and stage-show arts, stand next to this honorable meeting of academics who call for peace, we declare that we are on the side of freedom of expression, equality, right of life and unconditional peace."
"Our conscience and all of our hearts contribute our voice to the academics' call for peace and negotiation".
More than 400 filmmakers including Deniz Türkali, Attila Özdemiroğlu, Nadir Sarıbığak, Özcan Alper, Serra Yılmaz, Onur Celam, Yesim Ustaoğlu, Pelin Erşoğlu, Tolga Karaçelik were “We are on the side of freedom and art”.
But without but without if: "We will not be a party to this crime!"
We are on the side of the Academic Initiative for Peace", he supported the academics.
"We are with academics who have been targeted by the Linch campaign," said the Film Writers Association (SİYAD).
The Academics for Peace Initiative issued a statement titled “We are not participating in this crime”.
In addition to 1128 academics at the University of 89, Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar, who had worldwide reputations for his theories and books.
President Erdoğan and Prime Minister Davutoğlu sharply criticised the academic declaration as "support for terrorism", calling on institutions to do their due process.
Following this call, some universities had dismissed academics, while the prosecution had launched a resen investigation.
Yesterday many academics were taken into custody.
I'm a fan, please help me!
Sultan Hürrem's red hair, Beren's nose, Justin's hair...
Trying to look like a celebrity may seem normal to a point, but at a point where life is completely affected, it's considered a psychological disorder.
'Celebrity world wide-syndrome', a.k.a. "hospitalism syndrome", which has already become an academic subject in the world, and we're just being talked about.
Running into hair salons with famous photos of ladies is pretty much normal.
But let's not forget the year of Sultan Hürrem, when all the teenagers walked around with Irish red hair.
It's already been reported that 'Beren's Nose' has already taken the lead in the 2015 plastic surgery we left behind.
On the gentlemen's front, it's no different.
At one point, dressing up as Polat Alemdar was a matter of quality.
And now there's the opposite wind blowing through the air.
We're surrounded by Justin Bieber's copy of teenagers.
So much so that when you go to the barber's first, you cut the sides of your hair on the side of your ears and the surroundings on the top of your head.
Only the sides will be short.
After the cutting is done, you need to shape your hair with light water.
Once the deformation is complete, stabilize your hair with spray help.
"To get Justin's hair, you have to shape it when it's moist."
All of this has already become an academic subject in the world, and we're reminded of the newly-spoken "Celebrity world syndrome", aka 'holy worship syndrome.
Celebrity fans are seen in us as a ball of love.
Artists brag about how much it affects them with their fans.
Fortunately, psychology doesn't see it as that simple.
Especially when it comes to teenagers deciding what to eat, what to drink, what to listen to, what to wear, what to wear.
Excessive commitment to the names offered inaccessible, role modeling is described as a mental disorder.
Expert psychologist Sumeyye Demir admits Turkey is behind in the work in this area.
However, he does not miss that the families are slowly conscious: "One of the key issues of psychology is that one is at peace with one another, that one is at peace with himself, that one is at peace within one's own identity."
At first, it wouldn't have been taken very seriously to fill the children's rooms with posters, disguised as someone.
That's changing now.
His parents feel the need to intervene.
"A passionate commitment to someone is a sign that something is wrong with the young man's life."
Fans on an emotional roller coaster
Celebrity attention is safe, provided it's not too much.
Not wanting her to marry, jealous of her husband, prefers her dress-up, suggests paying attention to her symptoms, Iron.
We're talking about famous people.
To worry about them, to be concerned with their lives is to some extent normal.
But when the expert psychologist thinks it's the majority of young people who miss the cantar, "When there are no names in the family or the neighborhood to represent the child at the point of virtue, good behavior, that void fills."
There aren't always good samples.
"The boy is copying the inconsistencies."
When we consult them on how to approach them, Sumeyya Demir begins by reminding the celebrity that his passion syndrome is more common in puberty.
The problem instills more easily, given the fact that teenagers can be self-insecurities.
While complaining about the limitations of their families, we face young people who are looking for support and compassion: "We are obliged to consider their emotional ups and downs."
New research suggests that they were forced by changes in their brains.
"A young man who rides an emotional roller coaster is bound by passion. He must be welcomed. He must be treated with ease."
It's possible to change behavior.
Specialist psychologist Sumeyye Demir reminds the parents of their duties to overcome celebrity worship syndrome:
Recognise his emotional distress, make sure you are calm before you get involved.
Never let him suppress his emotions.
To encourage independence, tell them that you respect his admiration.
Instead of teaching by scolding, set a good example, discuss the role model names that will become his role model.
Try to discuss the role of celebrities in our everyday lives together.
Reading books about the real world of celebrities together will help.
Make sure your communication is transformed into an adult form.
Remember, addiction and motivation are the same way in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are an opportunity for change, accept him as he is.
Make sure you get expert support on fanfare.
Those who are angry and those who envy
At the root of celebrity worship syndrome, he needs help and help from someone else.
Uncontrollable love is actually a cry for help.
Unfortunately, that's not how it's perceived.
Moreover, this problem is so widespread that it is impossible to limit it to a country or a continent.
Dr. Recai Johnoglu notes that there are certain names in every country that occupy television.
Syndrome is more about commitment to these celebrities: "They're extraordinary."
The general majority doesn't have their resources.
Those who have it don't live by pretending to be them.
Either they don't embrace it or they don't dare.
"But those who have no means, and those who have no means to live like them, keep watching with anger."
There's no difference between those who envy or those who watch with anger.
They both secretly admire each other.
They make easy money, they're on the magazine's agenda.
That's enough to raise the fan.
Another advice from expert psychologist Sumeyya Demir is to question the reality of those lives at this point.
It can't be overlooked that artificial lives are at stake.
That's where the environmental support comes in to the person who has a passion for fame.
However, the person insists on admitting that the celebrity he's a fan has problems like his own.

Should I have a gallbladder surgery?
Dr. Fevzi Özönül answers questions at the corner of the Square Gazette.
I have a rock in my gallbladder, and every morning I wake up, and after meals, I go to the bathroom two or more times a day with abdominal pain.
Could that keep me from losing weight?
I'm using alkaline right now, but I can't eat less, I can't lose any weight.
It's been like this since I was a kid.
What should I do?
Do you think I should have gallbladder surgery?
ANSWER: The gallbladder is often accompanied by an infection.
And these abdominal pain complaints that develop right after dinner are a sign that when you eat, the gallbladder contractes and pours inflamed gallbladders into the intestines.
Distinguished by the infected bile, the intestines quickly try to throw this gall out.
That's why you guys go to the bathroom all the time.
And because you go to the bathroom a lot, your food gets thrown out without digesting, and your weight loss is slow.
I think you need to get this treated.
If you go to a gastrointerologist and the situation I'm telling you about is determined, you can use antibiotics to get out of this situation.
But sooner or later, you may need gallbladder surgery.
Alkaline probiotics can reduce your complaints a little, but they won't.
Whatever happens, I suggest you keep using the alkaline probiotics.
Because this is the probiotic dust that helps you lose weight.
I eat a lot when I'm stressed.
Teacher, when I'm stressed and nervous, I put myself into food and gain weight.
How am I supposed to deal with this?
ANSWER: A desire to eat too much means that the need for energy is not fully met.
This may be because of a lack of food or skipping morning and lunch.
Another reason is that you can't digest the food you eat.
For that to happen, your digestive system needs to function in good health.
If you don't have an ulcer or a reflux or something, the easiest way to do it is to use a good probiotic drug.
You'll get a lot of benefits.
I can't gain weight. The doctors don't know why.
You usually have information in your column about weakening.
It all makes perfect sense to me, but my situation is a little different.
I can't get any weight.
And most importantly, I don't know why.
Doctors don't say anything.
ANSWER: The techniques we use are not only designed to weaken, but to restore the physiological work of the body to its ideal size.
Fat and weak are the same kind of disorders.
In fat, not losing weight, not gaining weight in weakness is treated with the same technique.
And you get weaker when you eat sweet and dumpling food.
I think you've figured that out by now.
You can also be stimulated by carboxipuncture and gain weight with healthy nutrition.
So you've gone from your ideal body to your weakened body.
And our other patients got fat from their ideal bodies.
You'll gain weight and reach your ideal body, and they'll gain weight by losing it.
If the system problem goes away, you gain weight, they lose weight.
But first, the system needs to work properly.

The boy who feels worthless gets stuck in hate.
There are some feelings that are born into the human world of emotion.
Fear, sadness, happiness, confusion, anger, anxiety...
But feelings of hatred, hatred, vengeance, and vengeance are manifested in children over time and in some wrong attitudes.
Every person needs to be an individual, including his childhood.
So whether he respects his parents or social environment decisions, asks for his opinion on matters that concern him, makes him feel valuable.
Sustaining them is the basis of a healthy personality structure.
For example, actions such as deciding what to wear, what to eat, what to eat, what to do instead of what to do with a child’s rights (to be sent to an instrument course) mean not to respect the child’s personality.
Since the unrespected child lost his freedom to be himself, the defense mechanism reveals anger and hatred to protect him.
"Because, in fact, anger and hatred are the opposite of acceptance," says psychologist Hilal Arslan, who says, "that the boy hated to admit what had been done to him, and tried to explain to himself and to his surroundings that he was valuable.
"The hatred here means 'I am' and serves the purpose of keeping the child's self-respect," the expert psychologist said, adding that the child’s reaction was a positive development in his character development.
He says, "If the child is allowed to be an individual, the hatred will disappear."
The child strives to protect himself through anger and hatred.
At a young age, both physically and spiritually vulnerable times, children's parents say that subjecting to verbal and emotional violence by their environment can cause negative feelings in the child, and that neglect will make the child feel invisible, invisible.
"It may be that sometimes it is not only emotionally satisfied (to caress your hair, to hug and to kiss, to care for your school or other needs), but sometimes also physical needs (such as food, drinking, drinking, housing, school needs, etc.) are not met."
What a hate - inspiring upbringing that is.
In emotional and verbal violence, there are such acts as insults, insults, contempt, reprimands, unnecessary and severe punishments, feelings of worthlessness, shouting.
This behavior is directed at the child’s personality, so it touches a deep place.
"The child either loses self-esteem by accepting them and spends his life struggling with the feeling that he is worthless, unworthy of being loved and incapable of being loved, or he tries to protect himself by hiding in anger and hatred."
