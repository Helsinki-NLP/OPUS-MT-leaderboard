You've got everything.
You have nothing to complain about.
You have to control your emotions.
You have to see him.
You had a busy morning, didn't you?
You've never been to the States.
You passed the test.
You've probably heard of us.
You want a good horse.
You wanted an economy car, didn't you?
You want to donate money, don't you?
You're heavier than Tom, aren't you?
You were flirting with us.
You were getting undressed.
"You were great, Tom." "This is nothing you've ever seen."
You've been in on this the whole time.
You weren't very pretty.
You were opening the door.
You were right to leave.
You were so strong.
You're supposed to be ready.
You were great.
You're the one who suggested that I visit Tom.
You were unconscious.
That's the only place you'll get it.
You'll get hungry.
You'll have to join the project.
We'll have to settle for what we have.
You'll regret your decision.
Now you won't be able to do anything about him.
You won't be able to help us.
As long as Tom's alive, there's no rest for you.
There's no peace for you when Tom's alive.
You won't die of old age.
You're not fooling Tom.
You're not gonna get away with this.
You're not gonna give it to Tom, are you?
You won't have to do this today.
You won't regret hiring Tom.
You can't solve anything by crying.
You work in Milan.
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be in trouble.
You wouldn't want that to happen, would you?
You write very well, don't you?
You should know for yourself.
Let's get out of here.
Yumi will be a teacher.
Yuri usually went to London in those days.
Zeke Choi's spine was shattered by an assassin's bullet.
Zero degrees centigrade, high fever, poor Mr. Snowman.
Zeynep, my roommate.
Zimbabwe was once a British colony.
A pumpkin is a summer vegetable.
