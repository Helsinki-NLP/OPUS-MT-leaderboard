28-year-old Cook Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
The 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he didn't think he could have wanted to hurt her, saying, "In the end, things were going well for him."
San Francisco Forensic Medicine Agency announced Wednesday morning that the body found at the Westfield Mall belonged to a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department has reported that the cause of death has been determined as murder and that the investigation continues.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as kitchen chief in Boston, got his dream job six months ago and started working as the San Francisco Sons & Daughters kitchen chef.
The Sons & Daughters official said that they were "surprised and deeply upset" by this death.
"We are a small team working here as a tight family, and he will be missed very much," he said.
We'd like to tell Frank's family that they're not alone in this difficult time and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia said Frank was staying at the hostels at the beginning and said, "In the end, things were going well for him."
Louis Galicia said to the KGO, "He got an apartment and he was dating a girl."
Louis Galicia said she didn't think there'd be anyone who might want to hurt her little brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
The way to bond with the family was always to make us a plate, to cook for us," said Louis Galicia.
He didn't like to argue.
My brother, he'd fit into anything.
He said, "When everything else in the world went wrong, it was that raw diamond that shined brightly every day."

Assistant doctors on strike: Calls to slow down new jobs
Representatives of residents asked their unions to allow them to slow things down in connection with the dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Assistant Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on the general council to support further business slowdown from the beginning of September.
The ministers have been unable to address concerns about the contract, JDC said.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted against the agreement with the UN.
This was rejected by 58% of the voters.
In an article posted on Twitter Thursday night, JDC head Ellen McCourt said the government remains "silently silent" about the problems leading to the rejection of the contract.
"In light of that, the JDC Governing Body voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and called for a new formal debate on concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC administration has made an official request for the UN Council to allow a programme to increase business slowdown starting in September.
The dispute caused residents to participate in six strikes this year, including the first total cut in NHS history.
Dr. Johann Malawana, assistant doctor at the UNA, resigned after the UNA's proposed terms of contract were rejected.
During meetings prior to the vote of 54,000 residents and medical students, he told UNA members that this was a good deal to accept.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be implemented to be valid for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of the weak?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russia and Turkey's leaders met on Tuesday to announce the official end of the eight-month war on handshakes and words and economic sanctions.
However, while Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the fancy hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I was under the impression that Ankara was the one who wanted this settlement the most.
Shakes hands, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile was very weak, and his own limited standards could not have produced any heat against it.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin, five times according to a report.
I've lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to the pre-crisis level, but would reach far higher levels.
The next day, in a newspaper here, Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his excitement was the opposite of that.
But the cold impression that Mr. Putin gave around has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned at the opening was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
At the time, Russia's reaction was violent.
Mr. Putin made a tough move and accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The resentment was much bigger, thought the other side was friendly.
Trust will be hard to rebuild, perhaps impossible.
Since November, the Russian people have changed their minds.
The state-controlled media targeted Ankara for months in a shocking and aggressive manner.
Suddenly, the Turks are to blame for everything.
The most serious of these were accusations that senior officials profited from illegal oil trade in areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
He refused to do so.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
In the end, the reason this meeting took place was because Mr. Putin received an apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia might see it as some kind of victory.
The benefits of a ceasefire call for Ankara are clear.
First, Erdogan needs friends after a failed coup that took place last month that nearly brought him down.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have affected him greatly.
And economic reasons are also effective.
Russia's sanctions hit hard, especially banning special flights carrying several million Russian tourists to Turkey's coastal regions every year.
That number is down by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and rental companies were certainly relieved that flights would continue.
They're relying on the end of the season density in the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicted a reduction in fruit and vegetable prices by reintroducing Turkish agricultural imports.
To quote a story in the Vedemosti newspaper, "Tourists there, tomatoes here".
However, the visit also had a different political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for not finding the response to the coup attempt adequate.
In addition to his long-standing anger over the progress of talks on joining the United States at snail speed, Mr. Putin, who wants Turkey's ties to the West to be cut off and to benefit from the coldness between them.
The Russian leader certainly seems to have gained sympathy from Ankara because of the call for support of elected officials following the coup attempt.
Remember, it was inevitable for Moscow, who had a deep fear of regime change.
This summit, held at this fancy palace by the sea, represents an alliance of "improperties", as Russia and Turkey have explained to me by an analyst: the two countries the West rejects and mistreats join forces.
Yet, despite this display of compromise, they are quite different.
One of the most important ones is about Syria: Russia and Turkey support different sides, although Moscow makes itself a mediator.
After almost three hours of first talks, the two presidents said at the press conference that the issue had not been discussed.
While Turkey's President openly avoided answering a question about these differences, Mr Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on how to determine common ground in Syria.
But given the potential for absolute disaster, given the fact that after months of open hostility -- and the potential for a Russian fighter crash by NATO member Turkey -- the two leaders are at least likely to start talking.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside Scotland.
According to the president of the bank executive board, the RBS brand will be placed in the back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be destroyed for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told Scotland that the BBC brand RBS is linked to the bank's global goals.
Eight years ago, it almost sank, so you had to back off and give it up.
During that time, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer financial brands.
This was supported by millions of pounds for many sponsorships from the Six Nations rugby championship to the Wimbledon Andy Murray championship.
But now it's decided it's right for more national brands to come forward.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish clients, but new beginnings will not be made.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS will be changed to NatWest, except in the case of quotas to central and stock market.
The Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are smaller brands for individual banking that will take on a much more dominant role; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan interviewed me on a tour of Inverness-shire for clients and staff.
"Since we will be a bank of more brands from now on, there will be no longer the brand of RBS investor and staff employed," the BBC told Scotland.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying we don't have global goals anymore, we have local goals.
Each of these brands will come forward in a slightly different way in its community, and our staff will work under the names of these brands with customers.
RBS announced that it would not continue sponsoring the Six Nations championships and was boosting the profile of different brands for sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to move on to the brand bank because (we were asking ourselves) how can we make it a better bank for customers?" the executive board chairman said.
Three years ago, if we had indicated that we would be a great bank for our clients and that we would be presenting these brands, I would have found it ironic.
But I think you're going to see a lot of changes with the work we've been doing and focusing on the needs of customers, not on ourselves.
We can get these brands back online, so I think this is the right time.
Frankie Dettori won 3000 times with Predilation's victory at Newmarket.
Dettori burst champagne after reaching his 3000th victory with his double success at Newmarket.
The jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3000th victory in England in Newmarket on Friday.
On the local track, John Gosden trained Predillement to win the second victory of the night and reach this milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the obstacle course.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"This is a special occasion," said the jockey, who had won three championships in Ghayyar before.
I'm so touched that my parents are here.
I'm really happy that this is happening at Newmarket, where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's just a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel light and relaxed.
Dettori accepted cheers by bringing Predilation after victory
Two jockeys reached this milestone in the handicapped race: the champion jockey Richard Johnson and his 20-time champion, and the retired jockey Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4300 in his record-filled career.
Lester Piggott, who won the Derby nine times, has won 4493 victories.
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of our time, and it's not surprising that only a few people got to a milestone before him.
He's a man of style and strength, but he has a tactical mentality in the scales that makes him stronger than the others.
He represents the horse race in an extraordinary way, and with his enthusiasm and charisma, he's been drawing people into this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if it wasn't for a jockey who only competed on weekends and the big races, he might have won his 6,000th victory.
To be honest, Frankie has spent most of his 30 years in the United Kingdom with victories, which is great to see.
He has a very exciting character, and it's a very good quality for British racing, but beyond that, it's an extraordinary jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this milestone by jumping off the horse as a symbol.
Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of the British race for 20 years, from jumping races to jumping off horses to landings.
It was a bumpy road.
In 1996, he won many major races, including the famous 'Big Seven' victory at Ascot, but survived a plane crash and was banned from following a drug ban.
Three years ago, during his return from this six-month suspension, he showed that he had the strength to justify those who suspected him and to return to his best.
And it could go on for a while; Dettori once said he wanted to continue racing until he was at least 50.
Russian President Putin relieves chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly removed his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Mr. Ivanov was part of the inner circle that Mr. Putin trusted for many years.
63-year-old is now a special representative for environmental and transport problems.
In a statement from the Kremlin, Mr. Putin said that "Ivanov has decided to terminate his post as head of Russia", but no reason was given.
Anton Vaino, who has been acting as a deputy for Mr Ivanov since 2012, has been appointed for this position.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, Estonia, and graduated from the International Relations (MGIMO) of the well-known Moscow State Institute.
He then took care of the presidential protocol and the administration of government personnel; such are the statements on the Kremlin website (Russian).
After his deployment, he said to Mr. Putin, "Thank you for trusting me."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of law enforcement and monitoring the implementation of instructions.
On Friday, Mr. Putin announced to the Russian television station that he asked Mr. Ivanov to step down and recommended Mr. Vaino to take his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
It's a stunning move in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long worked as one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies, and Soviet security forces like him served the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin and aired on state television, both expressed that the chief of staff had voluntarily withdrawn from office.
However, despite the smiling poses given to the cameras, few people are convinced of that, especially during this time of parliamentary elections.
Is this some kind of dispute about a power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
However, the official statement that a person who could become president would suddenly want to direct Russia's environmental policy was met with great doubts.
According to a quote on the Kremlin website, Mr. Ivanov made a statement to Mr. Putin: "It is true that in a conversation in early 2012, I want you to trust me for four years for what you might call difficult -- even problematic.
Well, it looks like I've been chief of staff for four years, eight months.
Mr Ivanov assumed this post in December 2011.
He previously served as deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He's a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security forces, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Putin was the head of the Federal Security Force (FSB), which replaced the KGB, while Mr. Ivanov acted as his guardian.
When Mr. Putin took power, he made Ivanov one of his five most trusted people.
Since Mr. Putin's third term as president was unconstitutional, Mr. Ivanov was thought to be president after Mr. Putin's second term.
However, this mission was transferred to another of Putin's close allies, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin became prime minister three and a half years later, before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of Criminal Minds, was fired after hitting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical fight on his set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produced the show, announced in a joint statement that he had been fired.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology Tuesday prior to the termination announcement.
There were differences and disagreements about creative issues on the set.
"I regret that such an event has happened," he said in a statement.
In a statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, detailed information on how Gibson's character will be removed from a programme that follows a group of FBI agents will be given at a later date.
The 54-year-old actor in the situation comedy Dharma & Greg has been in the programme since the first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds, and for the past 12 years, I have worked to give my heart and soul to him," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I'd love to stay till the end, but that's not possible anymore.
I just want to thank writers, producers, actors, our great team, and, most importantly, the best supporters a show can have.
The programme is expected to return to the screens on September 28th for season 12th.
The mystery of the fish in the Banff garden
A person in the Banff area has applied for help identifying fish that appear in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that these 75 fish could be sandfish carried by a sea hose.
Bain, who lives 500 yards from the sea, released the footage on Periscope, hoping that someone would shed light on the appearance of two inches of fish.
Queensferry Pass: The bridge is now connected to Fife
The project worth £1.35 billion must be completed by May 2017
Engineers merged north and north of the Queensferry Pass, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four closings between the demon fans, which are about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge's section from Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The project worth £1.35 billion should be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the facilities today and became one of the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Pass.
We're all witnessing engineering on an epic scale with over 30,000 tons of concrete used to build just this part of the bridge.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge closing the gap between the viaduct and the bridge board, it's a delicate study that requires extremely sensitive tolerances for harmony.
In general, almost 79% of the total bridge board is already in place, the concrete dump of the first section of the chart will be held today in Rosyth, which means that the entire board will be ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
"In all bridge projects, the first closure is always an important milestone.
In this extraordinary project, this closure represents pioneering in construction engineering.
We had to close the gap on the north- or land-side, after the last road tray was placed and extended to the North Tower level.
This was carried out by a 700 millimeter south of the north.
It was a very big process, but also a very delicate procedure.
The reason it was huge was because it was 222 meters long, weighed nearly 6,000 tons, and had to be pulled at about 3% of the slope.
The reason it was sensitive was because the team had very low tolerance levels to comply with, and on both sides it was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Moelfre Bay rescue team: three men are lucky to be alive.
Three men were lucky to survive after falling off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station sounded an alarm Friday at 13:20 p.m. on British daylighttime, after the setup saw the case in Moelfre Bay.
Three men were trying to swim to a safe area while their boat kept moving on its own.
Moelfre, the lifeboat controller, said, "We saw the boat circled towards them and we were worried."
He said, " Lucky for us, he ran away with strong winds until we were on our way to them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the 60-year-old third man was found exhausted, clutching a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all taken to the lifeboat on their way to shore and brought to the lifeboat station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who fell into the water are lucky to be alive and never hurt.
There was an emergency stop cord on the boat engine, but when the boat capsized, it must have been severed somehow from the person who was driving the boat.
Someone was watching these three guys today.
A valuable hunting for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It's amazing how the world has changed.
The fact that young people and children no longer went out to play games, that they preferred to spend their free time looking at screens, was a situation that a lot of people felt sorry for over the past decade.
Pokemon Go encourages people to get off the couch and move.
The amount of time spent looking at screens, initially limited to television, eventually spread to video games and finally to smartphones.
So it's really great to see that technology and outdoor activity aren't mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, which was originally created for video games in the '90s, based on cartoons, playing cards and other byproducts.
Like many of the facts of popular culture, this new play was a riot when it was presented in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Later, the presentation was postponed in other countries due to intense attention caused by overloading servers.
Within days, Pokémon reached more users than Go Tinder and almost the same number of Twitter users.
So how does it work?
In short, players can take their smart phones and go looking for Pokémon, tracking them with GPS, and they can take pictures of what they find, or they can pick them up on the phone.
A generation that played the game at a younger age stepped off the couch and joined this madness.
In the United States, the "centre" has given a significant increase in the number of steps one person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app developed for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, said that among the people he followed during the two days after the release of the vote to the Washington Post, the 30-day exercise rate rose from 45 per cent per day to 53 per cent each day.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go; it can only see raw data at the exercise level.
Most public health campaigns, which encourage people to spend "30 minutes", "get out of the cane" and "get active every day", were ignored because most public health messages were boring and seemed to be passed on by people who seemed miserable.
But still, the importance of exercise is little to be stressed.
Regular exercisers are less likely to have cancer or depression.
Exercise provides assistance in matters such as weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, and it has a long list of advantages that cannot be listed here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that he takes people out to do something they enjoy.
This provides all three essential elements of health: action, fresh air and sunshine entertainment.
Some are even able to make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, there are grouchy party poopers looking for something to complain about.
And, of course, someone could walk into a door.
What difference does it make?
A great innovation has been presented.
Smart phone apps like Fitbit watched our move, but they didn't give us any reason to exercise like this game.
The innovation will wear off, and the use will fade over time.
However, due to Pokémon's success, many games will be produced that help people to be more active, fit, and healthy, by combining applications and virtual reality with activities in the real world.

Simone Biles won the gold medal in women's gymnastics general evaluation
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
It's dynamic about jumping.
He's comfortable with the balance device.
It's amazing with the ground.
It's down perfection at first.
And now he's an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast also completed the overall assessment on Thursday, making it clear at the Olympics that he and the rest of the world were different.
Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina, a total score of 62,198 points, silver medal winner and friend of the Final Five.
Simone Biles of the United States performed on Thursday at the women's artistic gymnastics general evaluation final at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil.
Biles became the fourth and fifth American woman to win the overall overall overall overall overall overall overall overall overall overall overall and announced her name as the best of her generation and perhaps the greatest of all time.
When the last total was published, she burst into tears, and her long journey to reach this moment ended.
This success has brought sports to the same level as athletes like Michael Phelps, who can be seen once in a generation that brings them to new levels:
Biles has spent the last three years as one of the most successful in this sport, with a stunning combination of the 15 world championships, 10 gold medals, and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton, who called himself "the best gymnast I've ever seen".
In Brazil, a final test was waiting for him; this competition was not between Biles and other people in the field, but rather between himself and the burden of great expectations.
To return to the family home in Spring, Texas with less than a handful of gold medals would be considered disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Aly Raisman won the gold and silver medal in the women's overall evaluation of artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil.
Biles won the first one Tuesday as an exclamation mark at the farewell party by retired national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insists that he never looked forward to his long run towards the summit, that's not entirely true.
The floor exercise, including the rounded passage of the routine, is designed with Latin music that will fully adapt to the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl discovered by Boorman's mother was a force when she was adopted as a child by her grandparents, and she was discovered by Boorman's mother on a trip to a gym where Aimee Boorman coached.
He hasn't lost one of his general evaluations since the summer of 2013; it's a winning streak that should continue as long as he wants.
Mustafina took the lead in two rotations, but it was temporary.
The balance device and ground exercises that Biles won the world championship were yet to be done.
He took the lead with 15,433 points on the balance device and crowned it in the ground exercise with 15,933 points.
While Raisman was waiting for the final score, he gave him a gentle hug, and as Biles' vision once wrote in a sketch book came true, tears appeared around his glowing red, white, and blue eye makeup.
Raisman's performance was a rematch of his fourth and then lost the bronze medal to Mustafina four years ago.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, which the Americans called "Nana", was in the lead.
From time to time, with a suspicious comeback, he managed to overcome the exercise, and then he sent a kiss to the crowd.
For 19-year-old Biles, the tweet he tweeted so much earlier this week has now reached a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims were shot while listening to music in the car in a serial killer case.
In Phoenix's first serial killer case in ten years, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in the car and listening to music, according to police reports released Thursday.
Officials said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on a driveway on June 12th.
According to the report, the gunman was standing on the passenger side of the car and fired eight rounds with the gun and drove away with another vehicle.
The police are saying these three murders didn't appear to be a robbery because the assailant didn't take the adult victims' handbags or $2,900.
A spokesman for the Phoenix police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting led investigators to investigate whether this was connected to the previous four attacks.
Over a four-month period, nine people were killed and two injured in nine attacks in the neighborhoods of Spanish origins.
At the beginning of this month, Howard explained to the CBS associate KPHO, "This happened in a residential area in front of a house".
The unsub is believed to have driven a model in the late 1990s, including a brown Nissan, a black BMW in the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers refused to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were related to the same killer and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital due to injuries and later died.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police it was not unusual for these people to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also issued a police report on the shooting that targeted an empty truck half an hour before the three murders.
Researchers found shell casings, pulled a bullet out of a seat, and found bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old microcephalic patient says, "It's getting better."
Like most six - year - old children, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, his toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, Edmund has a microcephalic disorder, a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know existed during her pregnancy.
When you first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't ask for this.
Of course it's not true, of course you want it."
He and his wife, Vincent, were told Edmund may never know them and may not even survive.
Some doctors have gone far enough to offer to be admitted to a nursing home.
"My first reaction was to say I don't think people are doing this anymore," Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with a walker.
Edmund couldn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still can't talk.
But he's slowly reaching some milestones.
He can walk with help and ride a bike.
Besides, she likes to play and sing with her two brothers.
Elizabeth is showing Edmund's sign language to say, "Please sing to me."
Picciuto told CBS News, "We're teaching him sign language."
But it's not sign language as we know it, it says Edmund made up his own signs.
The microcephalim can arise because of a number of different circumstances; a genetic condition such as Edmund may exist and may result from infections from measles and Zika during pregnancy.
Symptoms and the course of the disease can vary greatly.
It's too early to tell how people's lives will be affected by Zika infections.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of his future's uncertainty.
I kept asking what was going to happen.
What's it gonna be?
And he still doesn't know it.
In fact, I haven't asked a question about the nature of the disease in a long time, since I didn't really expect anyone to tell me.
Picciuto, however, is in a position to offer hopeful advice for the mothers of babies who are born to be sorry for Zika.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods in Louisiana, Mississippi have mobilised rescue teams.
In Louisiana, heavy rain and widespread flooding led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected by Saturday.
National Weather Services reported a flood in countless rivers in the northeast of Louisiana and south of Mississippi, which is a common danger of flooding after heavy rain.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards has expressed that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and support for neighborhoods affected by the situation is on the way.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governorial Office for Homeland Security and Emergency Prep, said demands have been made for high water vehicles, boats and trenches.
Steele said there were tons of trenches required for Tangipahoa Neighborhood alone.
By Saturday, there will be a flood attack in most of southern Louisiana.
Weather services have stated in a statement that there may be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in the area.
In southern Alabama, there was a flood in the Mobile area on Saturday, as the rain continued.
Recording levels are expected during the week at the Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana.
The forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flood flow in Ascension Neighborhood poses a threat, as the rivers full of water flow to Lake Maurepas are slow.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi state line, the Tickfaw River was already at the highest level measured at 9:00 a.m. Friday.
Rescue teams are continuing to save people from floods in the Amite and Wilkinson accidents in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson, were rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the waters from Beaver Creek normally 400 feet from his home were rising rapidly during the night.
He testified that another stepson who lived nearby had warned him.
Hansford said, "We woke up and the water kept coming."
It was right up to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level he'd seen in the creek during his 48 years here.
Hansford said that he and his family were disabled and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said he rescued all three emergency workers in a large military-style truck and took them to a fire station in Gloster on Friday.
As the heavy rains continue, the floods are "prevalent" and authorities are considering an evacuation order, he said.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston reported it raining 13.75 inches from midnight until Friday morning.
The ground has been well saturated since Wednesday, he said.
The authorities said that the streets under heavy rains and floods gave rise to the need for rescue of residents of Tangipahoa neighborhoods and the holidaying of schools in five school districts.
CBS associate WWL reported that a female city councilwoman in Tangipaho said 200 houses were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are now under water.
Neighborhood Manager Robby Miller said authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who were trapped in the rising waters.
In the town of Amite and in the city of Hammond, shelters have been opened for those who were evacuated.
He said, "When the waters start to retreat, they will be allowed back home."
In Hammond, the town of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed because of rising water, and trenches were offered to be picked up by residents who tried to keep the water away from their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we experienced was in March," said Lacy Landrum, city administrator.
This is going to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison Accident Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said the rain was steady on the Gulf Coast.
A number of homes were reported to be flooded on Tuesday, but no reports have been reported in this direction until Friday.
Keith Townson, director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in this area for 40 years.
Townson said, "I've seen water where I've never seen water before," and added, "and it's still raining."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown survived the attack on Philadelphia.
Police have announced that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, which is the second time a 6-year-old has been shot in the city this week.
CBS identified Mahaj Brown as his grandparents for Philadelphia.
His grandparents said Brown had multiple gunshot wounds in his body, including his groin, legs, arms and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was brought to the hospital.
Her grandmother Delores Melendez explained to the station, "She suffered so much, her tiny body was riddled with bullets."
I can't believe this.
He's been listed as one of those who maintain the boy's critical condition at the hospital, and he's been through some surgeries.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He was going to start first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was among the four shooters in the Germantown area.
Two were shot at 29, one at 32.
CBS Philadelphia stated that one of the 29-year-old males was critical and that the other two victims were stable.
The station reports that the child was found in the front seat of a car with one of the 29-year-old men in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are looking into whether or not one of the victims was violent.
Detectives said that more than one armed assailant may have fired on Philadelphia.
The crime scene was filled with shell casings of different assault weapons.
Looks like there was definitely a long-term shootout.
There were casings on both sides of the street and the sidewalk.
This indicates that there were multiple armed assailants and both were active," Philadelphia Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple homes and vehicles in the area have also been damaged.
No arrests have been made, and it's been reported that the police have been monitoring the security cameras.
Another 6-year-old girl was shot in the arm on Tuesday while playing outside her house in West Oak.
He's in recovery and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Simone, the reason we need Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team, and there's more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been more dominant.
Second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspire many different ethnic girls.
The structure of this team, brought together by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally showing an American look.
It also strengthens the presence of black and Latino women at the highest levels of this sport.
In the past four years, the first female gymnast has always been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
It's a powerful thing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America supported him.
The world will now be able to witness the extraordinary performances of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, three world champions, of their unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win a gold medal in women's overall assessment.
And his teammate Aly Raisman won a silver medal.
We're familiar with the best times in this sport, but that's not what it looks like at gymnastics courses across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed Aly and Madison to join the Olympic teams.
The reason they're the Final Five is because there's only four gymnasts on the next Olympic gymnastics team, and that's the last year Marta Karolyi will coach.
However, gymnastics is a very costly sport and gymnasts who work primarily in private gymnastics clubs that are funded by parents, primarily by training, travel, jerseys, competitions, hotel fees (for trainers, gymnasts and families) and many others.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburban neighborhoods that can support these businesses.
These clubs are the only places where gymnasts can be trained and require a costly and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have been training these athletes since the day they started gymnastics.
For countless young girls affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, we do not offer communities a more affordable and accessible gym education.
I founded my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my institutions, we have offered over 15,000 young people in the city, based in Harlem, free and low-cost gymnastics and coached both national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (where I grew up) to provide quality gymnastics training for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this wonderful Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop the body’s strength, flexibility and coordination and provide mental hard work, discipline, and determination.
This combination offers long-term advantages for health, school and business success.
It's going to inspire this team to lead thousands of young girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
Joining sports activities is especially important for girls.
We're going through some really exciting times.
Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, by bringing the gold medal to the Olympic team, thank you for making it clear that many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to be a healthy, strong, successful young woman.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, the residents decided to continue the strike.
The ministers hoped the dispute would end after reaching an agreement with British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the residents who participated in the vote voted against it.
In July, Mr. Hunt announced NHS plans to implement sanctions on the contract, stating that "no one has property" and that further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first group of residents has been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in working practices at night and weekends, to improve care beyond normal hours.
"Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will trigger the current labour crisis and that they do not agree with all doctors," Dr. Ellen McCourt, the head of the UNA's Assistant Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night.
The first group of doctors must be made progress in this process, which is only eight weeks away from a new contract, and time is almost up.
UNA's efforts to resolve the dispute by talking met with the government's reluctance to interact and deafening silence in some cases.
This is an improvement despite Jeremy Hunt's promise that his door will always be open last month.
"Jeremy Hunt must act quickly, lift sanctions, and listen to the concerns of the residents."
Residents clearly say they are prepared to increase business slowing actions if they do not do so.
During the last strike in late April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were postponed, nurses and consultants had to cover for doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped the dispute would end after reaching agreement on an improved contract with British Medical Association officials.
The UN wants to improve weekend fees for 54,000 residents on the contract.
The executive board manager of the NHS employers, Daniel Mortimer, called on the residents not to take any strike.
"Grev solves nothing, but by putting pressure on the already intensive staff and services, it causes concern, discomfort and distress for the patients, the caregivers and their families."
For the past two months, we have continued our talks with the Assistant Doctors Committee, and with the Ministry of Health and other officials, we have come to a positive understanding of their concerns about the mission of oversight and reporting.
Employers were hopeful that continuing positive communication in terms of important issues -- distribution, education flexibility, additional education costs for those taking a break in their careers, mutual understanding on curriculum, training leave and the difference in intergender salaries in medicine -- was a sign of how serious it was taken by the British Ministry of Medicine and Health, in accordance with agreements reached with the UNA in November, February and May.
A drug that can eliminate the danger of a heart attack at cost of £2 a day
Thousands of heart attack patients will be able to benefit from £2 a day after authorities offer to give it to more people for a longer period of time.
Contrary to coagulation, the Ttigrelor reduces the risk of repeated crisis for people with heart problems.
The drug was administered for 12 months following the heart attack and reduced the risk of paralysis or another crisis.
The NHS observer, NICE, suggested that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS observer, NICE, has suggested that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Each year, some 140,000 people in England have heart attacks, and a quarter of them have another crisis or stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is that fat material builds up records on the walls of the arteries.
If your record shatters, it could cause a blood clot and prevent the blood to go to the heart and cause a heart attack.
And if the clot hatches, it'll cause a stroke if it progresses through the blood flow and blocks the blood flow to the brain.
People who've had a crisis before are at a higher risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, created by the United Kingdom company AstraZeneca under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by reducing the possibility of clotting.
Today's NICE manual draft recommends that people be given 90 milligrams of Ticgrelor for 12 months and then 60 mgs per day with aspirin twice a day for three years.
"Although secondary prevention treatments exist, half of those with heart attacks or strokes, and usually the consequences are devastating," said Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE health technology assessment centre.
Fear of relapse can have a very negative effect on one’s quality of life.
The evidence shows that the use of the commercial with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of repeated heart attacks and strokes in previous heart attacks.
With the temporary recommendation of the Ticagrelor, we are pleased to have increased the treatment options offered to thousands of people who are waiting to take advantage of it.
More than three years of information on the effectiveness and security of the Ticagrelor -- the risk of bleeding at the beginning -- is limited, and the draft of the manual does not recommend treatment after this period.
PC culture boosts vote corruption in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was relieved of his post last year after the government report.
As today's devastating government report shows, the culture of political truth has caused widespread vote corruption to be ignored in Muslim communities.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles rebuked police, election monitors and city hall for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to "integrity on ethnic origin and religion".
The former community secretary and today's anti-corruption czar said the adoption of voters on religious grounds is so bad that police must be allowed to strip outside voting booths to protect the feared voters.
He suggested that voters keep their identities with them to prove their identity at the time they voted.
In the current situation, it's enough for the voter to say his name and address.
The report even recommends permanent ink on the finger during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said that those who report it should be protected better.
He has called for better access to the press on board documents and informal committees or working groups' decisions.
"This aims not only to protect against fraud in the elections, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was prepared on Downing Street's orders after Tower Hamlets' vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided to remove Mayor Lutfur Rahman after repeated corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that the Rahman was "insubordinately abusing" the religious feelings of the Muslim community and silenced those who criticised him on charges of racism and Islamophobia.
It was said that the Rahman "run his company on the basis that it was a religious duty for Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300, the game was suspicious or the result of the use of false identity, or voting as if it were someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He specifically warned about corruption in the voting by mail -- where the elderly members of the Muslim community allegedly pressured the island to vote for themselves.
Sir Eric has made some suggestions to organise the voting system, including having IDs to prove who people are.
"There has been evidence that some ethnic minority communities have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially in Pakistani and Bangladeshic communities, especially in women and young peoples.
"There were concerns that state institutions ignored such actions due to "political integrity" based on ethnicity and extreme sensitivity to religion."
Sir Eric has proposed 50 proposals to organise the system, including preventing political activists from "voting" with the post office.
The report, studied by Theresa May, also calls for tightening registration controls to prevent the election register from being used for immigration and social welfare corruption.
Taking into consideration the option of conditional identification of voters before voting.
Permanent ink on a person's fingers after voting to prevent a person from voting twice.
The systematic control of a person's nationality to determine the rightness to vote.
Applying a three-year limit on requests for voting by automatic mail.
Banning political campaign workers and activists from taking into action the votes sent by completed mail and the envelopes of the votes sent by mail.
The police are authorized to strip around voting booths.
Changing the law to ease the charge of scaring people under the 1983 Public Prosecutor's Code.
It's illegal to take pictures in voting booths.
The requirement is that only English be spoken in voting booths (except in Wales).
Enhancing the training of the staff to enforce the rule that voters enter the cabinet alone.
Sir Eric brutally criticised the Police Department, saying that no charges were made in the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court has ruled that there is no place for Lotfur Rahman and its representative to accuse them of repeated corruption and illegal activities," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt, based on the nature of the evidence.
He also criticised the city hall's "quallow marking controls", which are not effective in election registration departments.
Sir Eric said, "Tower Hamlets' court order last year was a warning alert.
Although our nation has the pride of creating the mother of parliaments, the spread of this worrying and secret election corruption and rejection by some institutions could undermine that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist type and other famous Rio Olympic players
This week, the fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics were furious about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to resemble the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is not the only athlete to stand out for the gold medal this summer, at least that's what social media thinks.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces we've seen on our screens, FEMAIL has prepared a list of Olympic athletes who look more like Hollywood celebrities than they do.
Hunter and wolf: US Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison (left) has been confronted with Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's likeness on the bike track, many people online have shown that an archer can look just like Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Archery Team, shook Twitter after the photos of him showing his resemblance to the Star of the Money Hunter movie.
And the archer admitted that he had been told that he looked like Leo since he was a child, realizing this madness in social media.
Brady told the Huffington Post, 'I don't think there's much resemblance except for hair and beard.'
'He's a handsome man himself, so I guess that's a compliment.'
One of London's most popular comparisons in 2012, and, without a doubt, there's an even more remarkable resemblance this year: the incredible resemblance of British long-jumping athlete Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina was said to be identical to Cuban-American artist Gloria Estefan, with large, meaningful eyes.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Change: This user states that Nathan's Startup movie star is an 'athletic version'
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have been compared to each other for a long time because of their thick eyebrows and the resemblance of their lips.
Russian team's silver medalist, Annalynne McCord, has the same bronze skin and blond hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while her fans say Nathan Adrian of the US Team "represents the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
Tough women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter's star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face and eyes
Not alone: A Twitter user was very pleased that other people noticed the resemblance
A theory that remains in the air: this user thinks there might be a reason why this pair is similar to this one.
One Twitter user moved his happiness to this site about "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are like twins".
In reality, the American football star and the actress in Dexter have similar facial features and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include the same smile by Kerri Walsh-Jinnings and actress Laura Linney, another gold medalist, Gabby Douglas, and Gabrielle Union, star of The Youth Fire.
The CBS Olympic announcer apologized for the Chinese swimmer's comment that he died like a pig.
Byron MacDonald's analysis of Ai Yanhan, 14 years old, fourth in the 4x200m free race angered people watching the CBS live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster, CBS, was forced to apologize for comments that one of the newscasters, a 14-year-old woman, the Chinese swimmer, was wiped out like a bad smell and died like a pig in the race.
Spiker Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when women started explaining their own ideas in the 4x200m free relay final.
It was heard that MacDonald, who was included in CBS's news crew to add 'color', said: 'The little 14-year-old Chinaman has screwed up, baby'.
He was overexcited, wiped out like a bad smell and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese Swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) finished the second leg of the flag race for 1:57.79, leaving Canada's Taylor Rack 1.61 seconds behind, allowing Canadians to close the gap between China and China.
Canadian audiences act quickly after being shocked by the tone and language used
Did Emmett Macfarlane just tweet, "Did the CCC newscaster just say that the 14-year-old swimmer died like a pig?"
The idiot didn't know he was still on the air.'
The Chinese Ai Yanhan was described in the 4x200m Free Flag Race as 'the 14-year-old Chinaman has failed, baby.'
On Twitter, very hard and very quickly, critics were released about Byron MacDonald, and many of them were self-reporting.
Twitter users couldn't help but notice how insensitive Byron Macdonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow, Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBS and Canada, and you're making us all look racist.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russel, who continues to broadcast the CBS, apologized for MacDonald's comment: 'We apologize for the comment on the swim race.'
Those were really unfortunate choice of words, and we're sorry this happened.'
CBS had to apologize at least 90 more times to those tweeting in response to the comment.
Scott Russell, another reporter, was forced to apologize on MacDonald's behalf.
CBC then copied and pasted this apology to over 90 Twitter users reporting complaints about MacDonald's comments.
The network quickly issued a statement apologizing.
We would like to express our sincere regret that these statements have been made and that they have been published.
Last night, on the air, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and on social media, our followers.
We'd like to explain that Byron's comments were not about the swimmer's personality, but about his performance.
However, those were very inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald also apologized on the air and attempted to defend his words, saying he did not wish to launch a personal attack.
"I want to apologize for a comment I made last night after the women's flag race," he said on the CBS Olympic broadcast.
'I was referring not to the swimmer's personality, but to his performance.'
'No need to say too much, I meant no disrespect, and I'm so sorry.'
Primark's client threw up rage at the woman who tried her underwear recklessly in the middle of the store.
Customers didn't know what to do when a woman took off her clothes to try on panties in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she looked at what it looked like on her, took it off and put it back on the shelf.
He kept looking and then tried four pairs of underwear at the bouvie place mall in Folkestone.
Before she put it back on the shelf, the place where she tried panties was at the bouvie place in Folkestone.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children who were at the store at the time, said that after she tried on the mystery woman's underwear, she had "redressed and left the store without taking anything".
He said, 'People couldn't believe their eyes.'
He stopped in the middle of the store, bought a pair of panties from the window, took off his pantyhose and pants and put them on.
'He didn't try to find a special place to do it, he was standing in the middle with all his disrespect.'
'Everyone was looking at her when she was taking off the hood, 'and it seemed like she didn't like the panties because she put it back on the shelf.'
He tried on three more panties before he decided he didn't like anything, and then he came out of the store dressed again.
'He didn't seem to care who was watching him, 'and he wasn't thinking about who was going to buy the panties he was trying on.'
Mrs. Davidson (33) in Kent County said: 'How disgusting to think that someone else would take an uncleaned pair of panties and go home.'
This happened Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: 'I think Personelin took the clothes off the market after he left, which is a good thing.'
'When I went home with a new pair of panties, 'it would be really bad to think that someone else had taken them off and came to me without washing.'
'Primarch is aware of what happened at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday (August 9th).'
The relevant product has been removed from sale.
How can you protect yourself against armed attacks with Krav Maga?
The outside world is very dangerous, but this video, presented by Dailymail.com, may help you to be safer.
We met with Rhon Mizrachi, the head of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to learn how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the situation against the robber.
Mizrachi says when you're approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around and see the attacker and you've got to clear the line of fire.
Then you put the gun between your forearm and your shoulder, and you hit him in the face with your empty elbow.
Then, when you knee him in the groin, the attacker's pain will double, and at this stage, you'll turn the gun around and take it away from him, and you'll hit him in the face with the barrel of the gun and the back side up.
A similar technique is applied when the gunman approaches from the front, pulling your body out of the line of fire, grabbing the gun and turning it in a way that the attacker can't fire.
At the same time, you put your weight on the gun, punch the attacker in the chest, take the gun away from him, and pull it back on him.
Does that sound tricky?
Take a look at the video to see how Mizrachi did it.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid any robbery is to give your money to the robber.
Traveler Ian Wright put his tongue in the dirtiest parts of Europe for his travel guide
The British traveler had a serious test of the immune system and the gag reflex by licking some of the filthiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The host and travel writer, Ian Wright of Suffolk (51), carried his tongue to a pay phone in Russia, a Euro note, a Piccadily Circus banister, and a toilet flush button in a train toilet to prove the power of the immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what kind of work he was involved in.
However, the experiment, which was to be transformed into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, produced some surprising results.
Although the thought of licking a flush button on a train used by thousands of people is extremely disgusting, there are actually more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his trip to Europe, Mr. Wright met with doctors and medical professionals about increased stomach bacteria and health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked has any effect other than the bad taste he left in his mouth.
Mr. Wright has been known to travel the world and eat strange and wonderful things to test his stomach strength.
From the general rails at the train stations to the toilet flush buttons, this task has certainly tested the immune system.
In the film about this, he said, 'I haven't been much of a health caregiver since I was a kid, and I put a lot of things in my mouth from the ground to the worm and the muddy water.'
And during the film, he proved to be absolutely certain why he was famous.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The drag sample showed over 4,000 units of L.U.L.C.
If there's a comparison, it's supposed to be under 60 in freshly washed hands.
But in freshly washed hands, under 60, when the L.L.A. count went up over 4,000 units, there was a Russian public toilet that he refused to lick.
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the film The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, showing the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
He said in the movie, 'This is close to being one of the worst things I've ever smelled in a bathroom.'
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was prepared with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with lactic acid bacteria, as well as Valio Gefilus, vitamins C and D, which helped strengthen his stomach bacteria and immune system.
"We really wanted to present something new to the consumers.
Something that's impressive to watch and also explains the benefits of probiotics.
We finally had a lot of crazy brainstorms where the idea of "Let's call Ian" came up.
They claim that interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put products in a much larger context; good and bad bacteria around us daily, the importance of stomach health and the connection to the immune system.
The interest in stomach health is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we would be able to give consumers interesting information about the situation.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added, "If Ian had licked some of the disgusting Russian toilets that I wanted him to lick, I would have lost respect for him."
Naturally, some things were easy for Ian to lick, but some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we're recording some of these nasty licks.'
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with stomach health, and 58 per cent said they use products containing lactic acid bacteria at least intermittently.
The Maganda family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall's social residence before the evacuation.
A mob family left $50,000 worth of damage to their social housing, where they were evacuated because they scared their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and his wife Shaun Trebilcock were expelled from the residence in Saltash, Cornwall, after several complaints against them.
When they were removed from the property by force, housing association officials were surprised that the property was irreparable.
There were big holes in the walls, the floorboards were ripped off, the garbage was scattered on the floor, and the graffiti was written on the walls.
The family is now suspended from the dwelling and is believed to benefit from private housing options
Cornwall Housing housing manager Donna McEvoy said she was afraid the situation would be unsavory.
'This is a real nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There's a lot to take into account because this property will now be known as an unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and a bad reputation.
The family had three sons who lived on the property from time to time, and police say that the family adopted a lot of frightening behavior, including fighting on the street with a baseball bat, scaring nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, and excessive yelling, arguing and blasphemy.
In June, antisocial behavior was decided for Skeldon (47) in the Kira contract.
Old trash found in many rooms of the house that was supposed to be destroyed.
The floorboards of the property used to sell drugs were removed
Neighbors said they saw fighting in the street and the police were often called.
Cornwall Housing forced him and his wife to leave the property this week after giving them 11 weeks to volunteer for their move.
The evacuation was welcomed by relieved neighbors who said their lives were turning into nightmares.
One person said, 'They didn't care about anyone.'
We've been living next to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You wouldn't believe how many times we've seen cops here.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We woke up because it was so quiet; we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, and everything's gonna be great now.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbouring enforcer, expressed that the family did not cooperate with the local administration.
The family had been living in this house for 20 years, and the property was often called police.
There was garbage and old toys on the side of the social dwelling covered with plants.
He added: 'It is a real shame that the renter has not taken any responsibility for the evacuation of himself and his family; the evacuation has always been the last option that Cornwall Housing resorted to.
It was a very difficult case because behavior was extreme and because its actions were too frightening for neighbors to witness.
I highly appreciate the efforts of my team, Devon and the Cornwall Police Force, and the community members who bravely stepped up to inform us.
I hope that this development will provide some relief to the neighbors and be understood as a message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said they had three sons living on the property at different times, but they were in their 20s.
A dirty bed left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the evacuation.
Housing staff will have to clean up the trash that surrounds the house.
In 2014, police raided the property to find over 70 grams of marijuana, scales, private goods and £1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he admitted to possession of Class B drugs with intent to sell.
He claimed he would use the money to buy a tombstone for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Tanya and her husband are now living in a private residence in Plymouth.
Most of the house had graffiti on the walls of its room.
Police said they would work to evacuate tenants who violated rent rules
The evacuation is also a warning for other tenants who continue to violate the rules, Devon and Cornwall Police Force Angela Crow said.
He said, 'This is a message for those who think they can act as they please without facing any accusations and whose actions will be wasted.'
The Devon and Cornwall Police Force, which will continue to work with their partners to protect society, will never tolerate crime and antisocial behavior.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified by a low-flying military plane just over the beach.
Tourists sunbathing in Portugal, Aveiro experienced the shock of their lives
The Portuguese air force, P-3C Orion, flew very low.
The air force said it was a training flight, but insisted there was no risk of safety.
This is the moment the tourists start panicking as we go over a beach full of low-flying jets.
Dramatic footage shows a military aircraft approaching almost contact level of sunbathing on sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Before they could see what was coming towards them through the clouds, the vacationers stood up, clearly concerned about the noise of the jet engines.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationers who shared a video of the dramatic close flight on social media, said: 'He's gone really low twice and seemed to be about to crash at some point.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and I swear I felt like the plane was going to fall on me.'
Tourists on the beach on Aveiro were terrified when the plane came out of the darkness and began to fly at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said that today the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify the fishing boats on the coast and had to go that low, since it was the only way to control them.
Because of the smoke from the nearby fire, the visibility was weak, the jet flew lower than normal, but the air force insisted that no one's safety was compromised.
This summer, fires that were hard to extinguish destroyed certain sections of the Portuguese mainland and killed four people on Madeira Island.
Portugal's air force said today that the pilot must fly low due to difficult conditions (intensive fog and smoke caused by difficult fires).
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats.
London girl student, who joined ISIS, was killed in Syria
One of the three English female students who left London to join ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee has stated that her family received information about her death in Rakka, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that he was thought to have died in a Russian air raid on Rakka, where the group was strong in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died planning to flee the country that had been damaged by the war and return to Britain.
"We hope that this situation will stress that it is really risky for others to go to war zones as a gravestone and as a will and discourage people to make that choice."
In February 2015, Sultana and two girls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS warrior in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid said he would not give up Garland as a Supreme Court candidate if Clinton was elected.
In the Senate, Democratic leader Harry Reid said he believed that if the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president, he would nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have been blocking Garland's approval process since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The Senate's majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said that the new president would choose the replacement of former Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
In a video talk Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would choose Garland and that he had "a reason for it".
Later, a spokesman speaking for Reid said he had not spoken directly to Clinton and speculated whether he would nominate Garland.
He praised Garland and expressed that Clinton's team did not want to "disrupt the situation" by making a new choice.
Garland, Columbia State Supreme Court of Appeals.
Reid stated that the Republicans who prevented Garland from being nominated were the "counselors" and "conservatives" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
Trump said he wasn't fit for duty.
Treats said he was in favor of a naked calendar as well as a man's.
Treads magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to publish an inspired calendar from Pirelli of the 1970s for 2017.
Instead of celebrities and nudes, however, they are working to find a new generation of top models for the 2017 NU muse calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of Treets, said that this magazine, which had a high nudity rate earlier this year, was different from the old Playboys, because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for women.
He obviously believes that's the calendar.
"We need to go back to display classical nudity, which is not out of fashion, so that women, like men, can easily look at these images of the female body as an inspiration," Shaw said in the calendar press release.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can send photos online or participate in open negotiations in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl target: who really buys records?
Middle-aged, lonely men love wini.
Before you go to the comments department to make great insults under the title "All the Lonely Middle Men," let us say that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the return of records, which are a subject of great importance, is not the result of the Y generation of innovation created by a physical object, but of middle-aged nostalgia.
Recently purchased vinyl albums, mostly between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the 18-24-year-old group is the lowest-case scenario.
This is not only the collection of curious people; it is also the emotional importance of older vinyl buyers who usually like to keep their feelings to themselves (56% and 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% and 66%).
And are yougov's results correct?
If this blog had been a televised story, the camera would have been walking on a crowded street in Soho, in a modest gray suit, making a lot of gestures before stopping, putting my hands together and opening them up, watching it say something authoritative like, "Let's have a look at it."
Well, let's have a look.
Soho's centre is slowly losing its magic and its unusual weather (now full of hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases), while there are still several professional record stores.
I'd probably like to stop the camera for the next part, and I'd try to stay close to different men in some of these stores and try to learn about their age and emotional state through observation.
Sister Ray's (two young women, three middle-aged men), Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, possibly a woman in her 20s), spends the afternoon in London to fill a few empty hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
He says, "I guess I am."
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, whose picture is up there, (officially e-mailed me, I didn't follow him home), decorate the living room walls.
The reason he collects so many albums and singles is because it's partly a result of his disposable income; he can buy records that he can't afford when he first comes out and buy back what he sold in his young and broke time.
Most of what I get is in the late '60s, early '70s, and I'm 11 or 12, and I'm too young to buy.
He agrees with the idea that there's a good chance that there are people who buy records who like to be alone, who like to be introverted, and he adds, "I don't smoke, I don't drink a lot.
That's my bad habit.
Wez (25) at Sister Ray also believes that most of the clients he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
However, he also realized that a new wave was formed that was affected by the exaggerated advertising in the media, and that people who heard that fashion was coming back needed to buy back old records.
In my interviews, I found that normally in 1998 or 1999, people were disposing of their collections.
Customers who used to sell vinyl to buy CDs are now selling CDs to get records back."
This could explain the rise of people of a certain age who reanimate the vini.
What about the alleged emotional significance of records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comfortable community of people with similar personalities.
According to Wez, some of the older clients were particularly offended by the non-contact payment system.
Some vinyl fans may want to seek refuge in the stability of the familiar record covers, which remind them of the overwhelming and calm memories of youth from the digital world.
Wez says, "Sometimes it's because of filling in a hole or seeing material objects as a kind of comfort."
Because I'm a collector myself, I have this, and I think most people have it.
That's an easy way to fill your head.
A colleague of his says, "We're like social workers."
A April survey revealed last month that 50% of the vinyl album recipients have not heard the album yet.
The survey found that 41% also owned a record player that they never used, and 7 percent bought vinyl, even though they didn't have a record player.
At this stage of the story, I'd probably be looking at a series of bossa nova compositions, and I'd look very worried.
The "reward" aspect of this comeback is an element noticed by Jonny (42), who works at Sounds of Universe (the data count: three middle-aged men).
"Soon someone came to me and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record to put on our shelf."
This does not represent a large percentage, but it certainly reflects the current situation.
More products, less music.
There are people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're not old people, they're young, they're late tens, they're new introductors.
Now, when I get to Fopp, who's got almost an entire floor reserved for vinyl, I see that the mass is quite variable.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, young boys and middle-aged women.
It's good to see the diversity among customers, although the atmosphere is spreading instead of calming and soothing jazz from the stores mentioned above (the last piece of Wild Beast).
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to resolve psychological traumas that bother them by standing next to someone for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) has been wandering around Fopp for a few minutes looking at records on sale.
Instead of spending it, he just went out to look at the windows.
He says he doesn't have an option to collect records because he doesn't earn much.
It's very costly.
It's easier to listen to music from the computer or in other ways, but the beauty of the winilin... is sighing away like a lover.
I don't know how to explain it, really nothing like it.
My last stop is a store called Urban Outfitters that inspires the next generation of vinyl fans.
As I pretend to be studying jeans, I observe a group of young girls gathered around Polaroid cameras for a while before a father and his daughter argue about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairwell full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac; records are essential for an average collection; a mixture of modern and classic.
No one's looking; maybe it's just for decoration, some of them too high to touch.
It's a purely artistic vinyl.
But curiosity about these items can mean that the industry will make more money and send fewer customers deep into Soho; there's not much to complain about.
It's not surprising that a demographic group with more money and more time than most spends more money on luxury items like vinyl.
However, my findings show that the results of YouGov are at least correct in Soho record stores; they do not account for female collectors and Vinil fans who are in large numbers, in reality, in record stores or online forums.
These people probably work pretty hard at school or offices.
These people certainly don't spend Thursday evenings wandering records stores on Berwick Street, studying records, and avoiding the looks of a 30-year-old fake TV host looking over middle-aged men's shoulders.
Greenland shark, the longest-lived vertebrate animal in the world - video news
Scientists have explained that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who worked on sharks, said the record belonged to a five-metre-long female, thought to be between the ages of 272 and 512.
French court rejects proposals for the destruction of stores at the Jungle refugee camp
A court in France rejected the offer of the Calais authorities to destroy dozens of stores and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees lived.
At this week's court hearing, Calais officials argued that a total of 72 pop-up shops should be destroyed by the state, where people in the camp sell many products, cut hair, or sold tea for 50 cents (40p) or some basic foods for a few euros.
The Governorship of Calais argued that these places should be destroyed because they created an untaxed parallel economy and are a risk to fire and hygiene.
Charity groups have told the court that stores and restaurants are vital, free food provided by state-sponsored organisations and other groups is not sufficient for the increased population in the camp.
They argued that shops and restaurants often provide shelters and free food for those in need.
A court in Lille said that there is no legal basis for the deportation of those who run 72 makeshift shops, but that the Governor of Calais' concerns were "absolutely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants play a much bigger role than simply feeding people living in "very dangerous conditions".
These areas provide comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers, he said.
One of the places that is in danger of collapse, the Jungle Children's Book Cafe offers 200 meals a day, teaches English and French, and here, hundreds of underage refugees in the camp are being offered asylum advice.
Over 170,000 people signed petitions to protect this cafe for children.
In a letter to Guardian, the closing process "will be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the population in the Jungle camp increased to over 9,000 (highest number so far) after rising in the summer.
After the gold in the mastering class, Fiji was satisfied with the silver medal in the rugby seven championships.
The impressive progress of Great Britain's rugby 7th Championship ended Thursday at the final with Fiji, following 43-7 defeats at Rio Deodoro Stadium.
To win the gold medal, which is the first Olympic medal of all colors, Fiji gave a mastering lesson in grips, rust, sidesteps, support, running lines and muscle.
After defeat, Britain received the third silver medal of the day as a not-so-bad consolation prize, and can now be proud of their efforts at the Olympic 7 opening tournament, where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
At the beginning of the day, the South African team, which they beat 7-5 in the semifinals, may have found them in the final.
But still, a Fiji with that much form could beat a team of 15.
Although it may not be very believable, perhaps Great Britain can find solace in the idea that at least one Brit will be wearing a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, an Englishman from Wimbledon.
This has been a difficult journey for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Seven Championships.
This time, they only lost one.
Although this defeat is painful, progress is truly astonishing.
Fiji got off to a fascinating start, and the players kind of bounced over Great Britain's attempts to get the ball.
It was like running between Captain Tom Mitchell and his crew in a series of moving buses, and when the World Series champions, Osea Kolinisao, took action from the corner, he took the lead 5-0.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai came out of the right wing with another curved number.
The game was 12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great intervention prevented Leone Nakarawa from throwing the third one, like a mountain, but it only delayed Fiji's number.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right-hand corner and Great Britain fell back 17-0.
With just a minute to go before the first half, Nakarawa scored another touchdown from the top.
Later, Vatemo Ravuvou crossed through some of the formidable British interventions and flew to the line for the score.
Between this number and the circuit, the score reached 29-0.
When Fiji was a team for the 7th Championship, Great Britain seemed to be trying to learn the basics.
That's pretty much it.
Great Britain made big changes between the circuits and closed the Fiji dam for four minutes, which was a good development for the first half, until Josua Tuisova came on stage with the perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton tried for Great Britain and tried to score from the left-hand corner to score 36-7, but the fans were in the hands of the South Sea Islanders, singing, waving flags and dancing.
It was really hard not to admire Fiji's whole cheerful approach.
Maa Viliame worshiped the latest additions to the Fiji play, which in the last few minutes didn't need decorating.
When the whistle blew, the Fijians began to celebrate, and Great Britain made its way to the dressing room, devastated.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji defeated Japan in the semi-finals 20-5, and Great Britain faced South Africa in a tough semi-final match; Britain came up with a single number.
In the first half, Kyle Brown puts the South African team first, but Dan Norton, with stunning footwork, takes the lead in the second half.
The victory and silver medal was guaranteed by the wonderful intervention of Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who was in the first 15th of England.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, inspired by their coach's fight against cancer, ran to victory on the shovel.
There will be no more emotional gold medals in these games, and that means something.
After 220 painful breaths from the first move to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment in Estacio da Lagoa could be much more meaningful.
Although there were two rowers, there were three voices on the boat; Robin Williams' voice echoed on the boat during the women's double race as the first women to reach such a level in England this year, as they advanced to the second gold Olympic medal in a row.
Their dominance was quite clear; this was the 39th race in their unprecedented series of invincibility.
Although we see two great athletes floating on the surface of swan grace, this image does not fully reflect the quality of victory.
Behind each oar gold medal, there's a battalion of willing hands that make this difference, and no hand was as effective as its trainers who didn't know if they'd live to see the day when they were diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
Like he said, they touched it and left.
I got the bladder cancer that could be surgically treated, and they did.
If they don't do it, it goes everywhere.
That would be a pretty bad situation.
This changes your view of life a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
He was very lucky to be able to start treatment outside of the season in 2014, and in situations like this, there's no telling if there's a right expression, but this way the distraction can be minimal.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better fast.
That was an incentive for me.
I was in the hospital, and even though they said I had to take a few steps, I was walking in the yard, like, six, nine, 15 yards.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey on its own, but it makes it a little bigger.
After the victory, Williams had a nervous morning, who spoke a little more than usual to overcome his own concerns.
Stanning, a captain at the Royal Artillery Association and had been to Afghanistan earlier, said, "This week I was emotionally devastated, maybe it's a little extreme, but it really means a lot."
That's another emphasis on what this means to me, and how hard Helen, me and Robin have worked.
I had three great years with Helen and Robin.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be either, so I'd like to thank her for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have found a better person or a better coach to work with.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The two have achieved an unreachable rhythm.
Stanning and Glover had not yet lost power, even in the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Danish teams were closing in.
We got caught up in that moment.
Helen was calling out, "Follow the process, watch the process."
It's really important that we don't get caught.
We got off on the right foot, and we weren't trying to do anything amazing.
We weren't expecting the fireworks to go off today, we just wanted to win the race we rowed so well, which we did.
The two will take a year off before deciding what to do with the future.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, the wedding of him and television adventurer Steve Backhall.
For now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That was gonna be a lot of pressure.
It took me six months to realize I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was so new, and I was so stressed.
Here, this took about four minutes.
It's a much better feeling."

Bulgaria Explains First Defa Inflation Values for 8 Months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in June.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) in years, but this is the first value seen above zero since October, after a positive 0.2% last year.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 – July 2016) was 0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 10%.0 compared to June 2016, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate (from July 2016 to December 2015 comparison) was 0.2%, and the monthly inflation difference between July 2016 and July 2015 was 0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, prices have been observed in the following consumer products groups: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices in clothing and shoes (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%) and health groups (0.1%) have dropped.
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco goods, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels remained at the same level in communication and education groups.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect, Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says it was inspired by animes for this filter, but some observers say it was racially insensitive.
Snapchat allows the lens tool to change the reality of around 150 million users daily to play with their ridiculous identities.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple or a dog or a Roy Lichtenstein character.
Lens are reckless, properties-altering tools that create over 30 million self-gravitations every day.
The wrong steps are quickly engraved into the public's memory.
Snapchat lenses have faced allegations in the past that practice supports black classification or offers bleached skin tones as a beauty ideal.
Therefore, this week, some critics criticised the company as a "Asian mask" that caricatured Asians because of the lens they presented, which made users gook-eyed, broken teeth and swollen cheeks.
And they wondered if these repeated conflicts pointed to a larger problem with the company's diversity.
News and anger spread through the news of The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday, and one day later, Snapchat announced that it had removed its property.
The company made a statement: The lens was not designed for cartoons of Asians, but for anime characters.
But for observers who had experience with racism, this lens reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Others generally refused an anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student and tweeted a lot about the photos, said in an e-mail that the lens was "slightestly painful and uncomfortable".
"It is difficult to argue when it comes to comparing the effects of the filter with the bad Asian cartoon.
Which suggests that the filter is not only an Asian mask, but a humiliatingly Asian mask.
Snapchat isn't the only company that transcends cultural trigger mechanisms.
American culture appears to be in an infinite conflict with diversity and coverage in many areas, from the conference rooms of institutions to Hollywood and the devices that we all carry.
And what Snapchat is referring to is that the vast young crowd, with more diversity of race than any other, can be interpreted as expecting a higher sensitivity.
In an interview Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates a humiliating image for a user, "it's much harder not to notice such movements as they used to be".
On Thursday, a product manager and engineer for the Medium, Ms. Zhu, decided to delete the Snapchat account and called everyone in this direction.
In an article he wrote for Medium and an interview on the phone, he said he believed that racial conflicts reflect the lack of diversity in hiring practices in Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu, the leader of the company, mostly white men, criticised his team and ended his article with a label: #SnapchatiSilin.
A Chinese American, Ms. Zhu said, "They can either make these kinds of decisions because different races are not in sufficient range among their staff, or even though they work there and belong to different races, they do not feel safe or comfortable enough to talk to each other."
Other observers share his views on this complaint, which Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
By highlighting the private company situation, the company does not share figures related to diversity among its staff.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to share racial origins of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company added a job chief to focus and increase its efforts to include the populations not recently adequately represented.
In her own way, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us who can say that that's not true."
The Congressional Panel said Military Officials Develop ISIS Intelligence
A congressional panel reported on Thursday that Central Command officials of the United States have violated intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
An intermediate report by the Palace's Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defence Fund Subcommittee, composed by Republican chairmans of the Board of Assemblys, found that its superiors were "a widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said the US forces had changed the assessments of the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters located in Tampa, Fla., overseeing American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of intelligence approved by senior Centcom leaders typically draw a more positive picture of the United States' efforts to prevent terrorism than the facts in the field have shown, and are often more positive than the analysis of other members of the intelligence community," the report quoted the report as saying.
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said, "What happened at Centcom is unacceptable; our fighting troops suffer when the senior decision-making authorities are presented with bad analysis."
The leadership failures at Centcom have reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report also gave details of the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015, which included Central Command's statement and analysis of America's efforts to educate Iraqi forces.
Although senior Obama administration officials have no clear evidence that they are ordering the reports to be changed, it is clear that analysts feel pressure from Centcom leaders to offer a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and DAESH.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional statements were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack on Musul's recovery could take place at a time of April or May 2015.
Musul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement: "After months of research, this matter has been made very clear."
From mid-2014 to mid-2020, senior intelligence leaders of the Central Command of the United States manipulated the commander's intelligence results to make the threat posed by ISIS seem insignificant in Iraq.
Republicans have formed a workforce after they have learned that analysts have expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State has been manipulated.
As the review continues, the report released on Thursday will follow much more comprehensive findings.
There's also another Centcom intelligence review being conducted by the Ministry of Defense's general inspector.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee also published their own findings Thursday that participated in some of the results of the Republican workforce.
The Democratic head of the committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff, said in a statement that "between 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created a very narrow-minded process in intelligence assessments of the DAESH and Iraqi Security Forces".
According to Mr. Schiff, this process "has delayed the publication of intelligence results", has caused morale among analysts and "has not given enough room for opposition views."
However, Mr. Schiff and the Democrats have stated that the White House has not found any evidence that Centcom analysts have been pressuring the results of a "preordinated or political narrative" fiction.
The preliminary results of the congressional review were announced by the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported a general review by a Pentagon inspector following complaints filed by Centcom analysts.
Senior Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, as a Pentagon spokesman, has stated in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the congressional report during the process of the investigation of the general inspector.
However, he said, "in some cases the experts may disagree over the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence supports the healthy dialogue on these important national security issues".
The study will echo beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria continues (this is an argument raised by more and more defence officials every day).
However, last year's accusations raised the question of how much President Obama could trust Central Command to evaluate military operations honestly in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Critics about the reflection of Islamic State intelligence began when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article saying that President George W. Bush's administration had advocated the existence of a small force in Iraq, despite the objections of many analysts, and had not thought enough of the invasion in 2003, and had been discussed for more than a decade.
Mr. Hooker also played an important role in the rebellion against Islamic State intelligence.
Authorities have noted that Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements last year, the air raids against the refinerys held by the Islamic State had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market, which did not significantly affect the terrorist group's financial resources.
However, as the Times indicated in September, this finding did not leave Central Command.
Last year, Centcom's former commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by many lawmakers for being considered a very positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and replaced him in Central Command is General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States Women's Hockey Team, preparing to meet Britain, has won its fourth victory in the back
On Thursday, after Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 victory against Japan, the United States scored the first two goals of the women's field hockey team in a match against India, when the Americans beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games may seem to require a catchy skill, but Bam (27) said he was not sure if he had done the same thing before.
He said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of those people who keeps track of his goals.
What he knows is that the Americans lead 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and share the first place in the group with Britain, which is undefeated after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday for the final game of the first round.
Both teams have won the quarterfinals, and the match will determine who will finish first and second of the six-team team.
The team that finished group matches first won't face the strong Dutch team, which leads another group when the quarterfinals begin, for a little longer.
But after Saturday's match, the Americans made a surprising breakthrough here after the London Olympics, when they came last among the 12 teams.
Bam was on this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa.; he was three years old when he first picked up the field hockey stick (and his twin sisters were interested in this sport at Drexel) and became the youngest player on the team at age 16.
He missed the 2008 Olympics because he couldn't make it to the last squad.
Then came the year 2012, when most things went wrong for him and his teammates.
The following year, an English coach Craig Parnham was appointed and things began to change.
Bam says, "Cultural change, mental change, physical change."
We don't work like London anymore.
We're completely transformed.
Thursday night, Bam scored the first issue of the first half with a close reverse hit.
India had not yet won a victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly resilient and managed to maintain the score as 1-0 until the third quarter, when Bam came in.
He did a long run from the left side of the field, and then he curled up in the middle and threw the ball into the fort and put the Americans in front of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first time the United States goalie Briggs, who allowed one goal in the first three victories, didn't score in the tournament.
His luck's up.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good this place is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trambolin Calm in the Middle of Olympic Ambitiousness
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics are going on.
The events at Rio de Janeiro represent an ambitious competition and work, and it's like it's never going to end or be avoided.
The Olympic torch itself is like a flaming bat passed from swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps, and Chad, and Clos, you can't watch television, you can't read a newspaper, or you can't listen to what your neighbor says in a cafe.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, who first participated in the Olympics, may be one of the first sponsors and TV commercials to suggest that you feel good about yourself, may be a dimpled heart ball, such as a swimmer, a gymnast, or a fencing player, which is one of the names shown during prime time.
However, from Lake Forest, California, Mr. Dooley (28) competes for the gold medal at the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equally.
Away from the center, there are some semi-recognizable sports in the shadow: air rifle shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.
He'll always be with us in the toading, and he'll always be with us for a long time.
But if I may express my personal favorite, I'd like to point out the secret spell of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been known as an Olympic event since it was introduced at the Sydney Games in 2000, very few people in the 16 years did not realize it was an Olympic sport.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to compete for the competition, it never won a medal on the trampoline, and it did not have a finalist until 2012.
In men, the Chinese and the Russians, and in women, the Chinese and the Canadians tend to share their prizes.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will try to protect the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, the trampoline draws attention as an underprivileged event, partly because it is thought to be worthy of clown school in unconscious ears rather than the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert here, I'm just interested.
It has a funny potential (such as the cartoon-like tremor of the never-ending leap) but it also reflects the elegance of gymnastics and diving, which is basically two sports that it combines.
The word "trambolin" comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means "tamplen".
Champion candidates jump almost 30 feet above the air on a large trampoline, and they are asked to make a series of moves (burking, piques and rafts) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 16 men and 16 women from 17 countries will compete with 32 athletes.
The most common progress in the Olympics is directly forward.
Those who hope to receive medals must go further, faster and higher in some cases to the end of their search for gold, and in some cases back and forth, up and down.
They're not just after the finish line or the starting wall, but there's another tough line on TV, the world or Olympic record.
This determined effort is enough to drown even an audience in tears at noble, envious, and even extreme levels.
But that's exactly what I find a bit exhausting watching the Games.
The trampoline allows you to take a break from all this.
The ones on the trampoline move upwards.
Their goal is not to move forward.
He jumps up, looks weightless like an astronaut, goes up, goes down, and goes back up without effort.
Of course, it's not exactly competitive or difficult, but during routine, there's no feverish work, there's no getting lost away, just the graceful suspension of time and gravity, like a dream.
As calm as an Olympic race can be.
Women's rankings and then finals will be held Friday afternoon at 1 p.m. Eastern time, men again Saturday at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as of 2:00 p.m. every other day.
In the midst of the Olympic frenzy, they are promising a quiet and wonderful moment that can be ignored in the general struggle.
And if consciousness, according to The Wall Street Journal, as the United States male gymnasts have recently suggested, will only increase by offering male athletes to stare and objectify, we can say that Mr. Dooley is waiting for his new fans.
In Ethiopia, the longtime ally of the United States, "A Generation of Protests"
Protests for Violence in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia met the government's fierce resistance.
Witnesses say many protestors received deadly gunshot wounds in a shootout with the police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, he has been a strong ally for the West with one of the most stable nations in Africa and its rapidly growing economy.
However, anti-government protests over the past months have spread to more and more regions and rocked the country.
Only last week, thousands of people went out on the street and demanded basic political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's reaction to this was brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
Protests, thought to be late last year or early this year, show security officials lashing young people who have to keep their hands up against a wall.
The top U.N. human rights official is now requesting a thorough examination.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to move forward," said Rashid Abdi, project director of the International Crisis Group, an international group.
After Ethiopia, Nigeria, Africa's population is one of the highest nations and its stability is appreciated by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially Somalia, and there are few countries in Africa that have had this much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing dramatically.
Its infrastructure has been effectively improved; there is a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although the best example of democracy was not presented in Ethiopia (all human rights groups constantly refer to the government's oppressive stance) the domestic opposition was very limited, the opposition was effectively silenced.
Most of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or banished to the remotest corners of the desert.
But that may be about to change.
Seyoum Teshome, a university professor from Central Ethiopia, said, "If you strangle people and give them no choice but to protest, these events will occur."
Youth is in full protest.
A generation of protests.
There are many complaints from the use of land to the pressures imposed by the ruling coalition on power.
Following last year's election, the ruling party and its allies also received the last seat filled by the opposition, and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions in the border are increasing with Eritrea, the sharp and controversial line that led to the war in June, which killed hundreds of people.
Analysts fear that breakaway groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, will be re-armed using this turbulence in recent years.
There are several factors that explain why the pain that has been boiling beneath the surface for years is now exploding.
The first seems innocent: smart phones.
As cheap smartphones became popular and the Internet service was provided, only a few years ago a large number of Ethiopians began to communicate using social media.
Even when the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during times of protest, most people were able to communicate through Internet proxy servers that hid their positions.
A few young Ethiopians say they're gathered like this for protests.
Second, solidarity among Ethiopia's two major ethnic groups, the Oromos and the Amharas, has also increased.
Oromos and Amharas are not normally allies.
For a very long time, Amharas from the dominant Christian areas of Ethiopia have been taking advantage of Oromos, most Muslims, who live in politics and business, and live on flat terrain.
But that also changes.
"We are gathering under an umbrella and moving towards co-operation," said Mulatu Gemechu, a Oromo leader.
The largest protests were seen in the regions of Amhara and Oromo.
Most Amhara and Oromo believe that Ethiopia has been unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which constitutes about 6 per cent of the population and dominates military, intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third reason behind the unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Mr. Meles served as prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unexplained disease in 2012.
He was thought to be a tactical genius who saw what everyone couldn't see.
Analysts say he specializes in identifying and disarming competitors, especially the first signs of unrest.
"The current regime does not have that basic information," said conflict analyst Mr Abdi.
The new prime minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen in relative uncertainty to replace Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he has not earned the trust of security services controlled by the Tigrayans.
As a result, more blood has been shed with more fear.
Ethiopia's latest experience in such a mess was a protest by thousands of analysts in 2005 following thefts committed by the government after a sloppy election.
In the following measures, many protesters have been killed less than last month, and the period of confusion has passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visional infrastructure planning and significant progress in fighting poverty, such as the new suburban train.
But it clearly does not stop the hatred of the Ethiopian government from increasing.
And it's getting dangerous and ethnic.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by the Tigrayans, and Tigrayan hatred has increased in social media.
Analysts say the protests have left the United States and other allies in the West in a strange position.
The U.S. government was using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights on neighbouring Somalia, but it was recently said to have been shut down.
The West clearly wants to support democracy, but it doesn't want its ally in a fragile region to be torn apart.
Mr. Abdi said, "This" and added, "It's like walking on a very thin rope."
Donald Trump explained Obama's claim to build ISIS as "Judgery".
On Friday, Donald J. Trump insisted several times last week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "forgers" of the Islamic State terrorist group, but tried to eliminate the latest conflict around his campaign.
This statement raises new questions about the Republican candidate's ability to communicate openly with the American people.
It also puts it in a strange position in the process when they try to explain that that's not what they're trying to imply by its representatives, who are doing everything they can to defend it.
Mr. Trump, after making this suggestion at a rally Wednesday night, insisted Thursday that the president and Mrs. Clinton had actually implied that he had built ISIS in interviews by strengthening his thesis.
However, in his post on Twitter early Friday morning, Mr Trump said he made only a cynical statement.
Posti showed that in a series of interviews, Mr. Trump had completely backed down the day before when he said he was serious about this accusation.
Conservative radio programmer Hugh Hewitt reminded Mr. Obama that he wanted to destroy ISIS, and when Mr. Trump tried to help him soften that comment, the Republican presidential candidate said he didn't believe it.
Mr. Trump, after the polls went down, his campaign was trying to change focus, and the latest chaos arose.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton had a conflicting conversation this week about economics in Michigan.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to get back to it.
Again, on Twitter, he said that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would increase taxes and find her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
By the end of July, after having displayed a look that suggested that the Russians attack Ms. Clinton's e-mails in a pirate attack, she said, "Of course, I said it in a cynical way."
This approach allows Mr Trump to push the limits of his political speech and step back where he needs to.
Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who followed the language used by both candidates, said, "It's a pattern that allows this to make "explain" in some way, depending on the reaction, by testing how certain messages react to those who support it.
But at the same time, he gives these statements on purpose and knows it's too vague to filter from different lenses.
After dropping in polls recently, Mr. Trump adopted a much more aggressive attitude rather than softening the air for the general election crowd.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey released on Friday showed that Mr Trump was far behind Ms. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and there was a tight race in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump often avoids apologizing for the provocative things he says, he accuses those who criticize him of twisting his words or his humor.
However, Mr. Trump's jokes, which have been subjected to much more scrutiny in the last months of the presidential campaign, have put his loyal supporters in a difficult position to support him in public, no matter how provocative his comments are.
Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani did his best to defend the island in an interview with CNN on Thursday as one of Mr. Trump's most prominent supporters.
When asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's thesis that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, "I think he's making a legitimate political criticism."
In a way, before Obama, ISIS was an unknown small organization, and those who found them cute were completely wrong, and that was because the soldiers were pulled out of Iraq.
Most prominent Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, which Mrs. Clinton is doing as foreign minister, has failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East and has caused ISIS to grow.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to accuse the news media on Twitter of twisting every word and acting biasedly against him.
"They can't do that!" he laughed at the "poor, pathetic" television experts who tried to figure him out.
Some Democrats mocked Mr Trump's excuse and said it was evidence that he was unfit for office.
We're back at Greenpoint, the Cafe that Can't Cope With Prices
Verb Cafe Wi-Fi, an old cash-only place in Williamsburg, offered great coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, Bedford couldn't handle the prices at his store on Avenue.
The store that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014 sells Soap Cherie cupcakes.
Residents complained that this was the last loss of the city that had been refined.
"New York is change, I know that, but I still can't believe the CBGB is gone and the Chelsea Hotel has been evacuated and Verb is now a soap store."
But New York is a city of reinvention as much as change.
Last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original position, a renovated Verb Cafe opened in the north.
It has a new Verb Cafe Wi-Fi connection, and it accepts credit cards, but it maintains some of its former employees and its similar basic weather.
Coffee's still good.
The head of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, the long-term employee of the old cafe, the owner and general manager of the new place.
He joined the Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When a client offered him funding for this new place, he said he'd be thrilled to do it.
Mr. Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for bagels and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
In fact, the old Verb's lights were reused here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to offer some different experiences.
He added new materials.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are also served on the menu, including capers and sautéed onions.
They've got brown rice bowls.
The cafe doesn't serve beer anymore, but it does serve fresh juices.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he noticed the old regulars were coming in decisively.
He said, "Many of our former clients couldn't handle the prices in Williamsburg."
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Miss Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and often went to Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he didn't stop going down this road.
He said he stopped drinking coffee for a while after Verb closed.
He said, "I realized that what I loved was coffee and culture in Verb."
Now he's drinking coffee again, but the other day, instead of his usual iced coffee, he chose a new addition to the dew mix.
Another regular Tom Rosenthal went to Verb regularly from 2003.
He used to go there before work and order the same thing all the time.
He said, "Every day, at quarter past seven, I'd walk in without fail and they'd make my daily order of buttered bagels."
The photo, Mr. Rodriguez, said he wanted to make a change and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he makes a change by adding bacon, eggs and cheese to his daily order.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wasn't mad at the soap store that replaced the old place.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the cafe's cold brewed coffee.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer."
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint adopted this cafe.
One of the new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said that he would soon find a space for his new neighbors to make them feel better.
There are other advantages to the new location.
The local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee.
There's a possibility that the cafe will be extended to the building next door.
For most customers, a new Verb is enough to exist to find his old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and he was very upset after the place closed down.
When the new place opened, Mr Whitt said it made him feel at home to come in and get coffee.
He said, "I had to smell this."
"A Square Meal" by Depressive Food of Crisis Times
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch at the Oval Office, shortly after his seat as President.
President Roosevelt, a strangler, loved fancy Fifth Avenue foods like foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
That day's menu was much more modest: boiled eggs, mashed potatoes with tomato sauce, and dried plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of solidarity with those in distress about food," Jane Ziegelman said.
"It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat," his wife Andrew Coe added.
The couple who live in Brooklyn Heights, they're food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Mrs. Ziegelman, in her book "97 Orchard", was about eating the lives of the slums in the Lower East.
The new book they work with, "A Square Meal", which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, tells the history of American food during the Great Depression.
They have met with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet, located in the Flatiron region since 1929, the year the crisis began.
While Mrs. Ziegelman (54), ordering cream cheese and olive sandwiches, Mr. Coe (57), preferred turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter's meat loaf order suitable for discussion of crisis-time food.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "The nuts were very popular."
He had peanut nuts, liver nuts, dried beans.
They were made from something cheap that spreads material and material.
Think of all the peanuts you've had for dinner.
Mr. Coe, he's got a sour face.
He said, "It must have sat in a man's stomach like a bullet."
In the years leading up to the crisis, especially in rural areas, the tables in America were like buffets.
Women were cooking for men working on farms and serving freshly baked pies at breakfast, lunch, and dinners.
In World War I, the Americans were sending food to the starving Europeans, which explains the history of the nation's methods of coping with the sudden withdrawal from being the center of abundance.
When Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it, he said, "This was a time when food became a central, worrying issue for Americans."
The new budget regime was equally alarming: mysterious foods such as salmon and casseroles became the basic product of consumption, which, according to Ms. Ziegelman, was "a great way to evaluate the remaining foods" so that the cooks could hide the lower appetites with a creamed sauce coat and cover-up.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Over the years, meat found at the heart of American food has become a luxury that has been scrupulously shared.
Interesting mixtures of calories and nutritional value have been tested, and the sense of satisfaction precedes taste or general sense of cuisine.
When Mrs. Ziegelman was doing research on her book, which included recipes, she prepared an onion meal in the peanut butter oven.
"This was not a popular contribution to the dinner table," said Mr. Coe.
Mrs. Ziegelman supported it: "This was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing in common with onion in the oven.
It was a prominent feature in most home economic recipes.
Between 1923 and 1943, home economic experts, including Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, guided the country's eating habits as never before.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be "surrendered", and they spread the struggle to transform the dish into delicious foods, such as carrot cream spaghetti.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historic delicious bites.
The government's responses to hungry citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's attitude of letting me eat cake, are very appetizing.
On the one hand, he was praising simple Iowa farmers' meals in his childhood, and on the other hand, he was eating food like a millionaire intellectual.
Mr. Coe said, "He liked to eat the flavors of European cuisine like a fish in a salad sauce."
He ate his meals in a dining room almost entirely gold-plated, wearing jackets that fit his dinner.
It was far from the truth.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to set an example with her stomach.
According to the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an assistant who didn't care about taste, the White House was not only presented with "the saddest foods ever prepared, but also the most depressing dishes. "
After the country stepped back on its feet, many of the methods of cooking during the crisis were put aside.
According to Mrs. Ziegelman, understanding and science focused on calories and nutrition continues to apply to cooking.
The couple expressed that Mrs. Ziegelman's mother learned a lot from her eating habits when she was writing the book -- for example, she could never throw it away.
Mr. Coe said, "The waste of food really scared him."
Mrs. Ziegelman told me about her old memories: "She really made people sick."
There was a cream bun incident.
After the dishes were collected at Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe took out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the prunes that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "It's called scrambled prunes," and she added, the most frequently applied trick was to call these humble recipes a cool name.
No whipped cream; just prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone hesitatedly dived in the brown sticky spoon.
Surprisingly, it wasn't so bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third spoon.
Like someone who might have been saving money, he said to his wife, "I could use some chopped walnuts."
Gilead will receive lawyer fees in the fight against Merc and Hepatitis C patent.
According to the US regional judge, Gilead Sciences Inc has earned legal fees for the Hepatitis C patent with drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
After finding out that US judge Merck had committed a series of false acts, including perjury and other unethical practices, Gilead was relieved of $200m in compensation for the violation of two Merc patents related to Gilead's highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni in June.
At Thursday's hearing, US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead had the right to be compensated for the fees that took place during the trial defence.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, the market's ruler, with the new generation of Hepatitis C that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory labor for sophosbuvir, the active substance of Gilead's drugs.
US-backed forces say that Membic's control is completely taken from the State of Islam
On Friday, group spokesman said US-backed forces, the last Islamic State fighters within the city, had taken full control of the northern city of Membic, near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) are in the process of cleaning up the city after a group of remaining militants have left the city.
Shaphan Dervis, of the Membic Military Council in alliance with the SDG, told Routers that they had released over 2,000 civilian hostages in the hands of militants.
He said to Routers, "The city is now completely under our control, but we're doing some cleaning."
The Clinton family won $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of the federal tax.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton announced a 2015 tax return showing that the Democratic candidate and his wife made $10.75m last year and paid 34.2 per cent federal tax.
In 2015, the Clinton family contributed $1m to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, and former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3m from their speech fees, and the former foreign minister announced that he had made $3m for his book from the Simon & Schuster publishing house on his time at the State Department.
Clinton's candidate friend, the U.S. Senator, Tim Kaine from Virginia, published a 10-year tax returns with his wife, Anne Holton.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax at 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for fiscal transparency," Clinton campaign official Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and steps back on promises to explain his first tax returns.
It's a tradition for U.S. presidential candidates to present their tax returns to the public, even though they don't require laws.
Trump and his lawyers, a businessman from New York, said that the reason for the release of the statements was because of an audit by the Incomes Administration.
In connection with the Democratic candidate's statements, Clinton campaign officer Ian Sams tweeted, "You're next."
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to publish them until the inspections are complete.
Criticising Trump, a Republican candidate for president in 2012, the group criticised him for his rejection of many other connections, including self-esteem, contributions to charities, business deals and those with Russia.
Clinton went on Friday with an online video showing high-ranking Republicans pressuring Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he voiced this problem in an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, to publish tax returns," he told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump had barely paid taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, New York Times business columnists shared statements that a series of tax lawyers and accountants may still be in this situation.
Federal tax rates have become a major problem in the presidential election.
Clinton offered a rule that is named after billionaire investor Warren Buffet, who will pay taxes at least 30 per cent of the income of over $1 million a year.
President Obama supports that offer.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Nebraska, Omaha, the Berkshire Hathaway group challenged Buffett to come to Trump and offer his tax returns.
Buffet said he was also under the IRS audit and "scared" of voters, not Trump's tax collection agency.
Clinton published tax returns in his campaign up to 2007.
Currently living in Chappaqua, New York, the Clinton family paid about 32 per cent of the average federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate reached about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton family's statement for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only about $100 of their income comes from wages.
Their main investment is a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clinton family has declared that the dividends and interest revenues are $109,000.

The powdered red pepper condoms, the chestnuts, help protect the elephants in Tanzania.
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from entering human settlements, throwing condoms filled with powdered red peppers.
The method was proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation and the U.S.-based Nature Protection Union, which came up with this idea a few years ago, took steps to promote it; they began training volunteers and crops in villages in northern Tanzania to use the four-step method of protecting their homes and crops without harming animals, not violence.
Before, most people used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"We have seen a change in attitude in these communities since we developed the vehicle set; they are now more confident that they can keep elephants off their land without harming elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include holding a flashlight and honking a horn to the passing elephant.
When that's not possible, what's called a red pepper cloud is thrown out.
The powder pepper mixed with the soil is placed in a condom with a chestnut flare, which only closes the tip so that the detonator remains open.
When burned, the condom opens with the sound of an explosion and scatters red peppers into the air in powder.
Even a breath is enough to send the elephants in the opposite direction.
The last resort is to use a catapult that shoots fireworks into the air, causing a loud, shiny explosion.
The Jewish filmmaker knocked down the hotel in Berlin on the Arab "telebe" on the Israeli phone code - RT News
After a Jewish French filmmaker discovered that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone code and that its employee suggested "oppositions" of Arab clients, it sparked media sensation.
Claude Lanzmann, one of the authors of the "Shoh" documentary on genocide, expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German broadcast body FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel in his recent stay.
However, the country was not among the states that could be searched directly from the room.
In 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, how can Israel be eliminated and destroyed?
It did, Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to search Israel through its own call center.
The film producer reported the situation to the hotel reception to get an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote that his response shocked him.
The hotel's secretary said the measure was taken by "a deliberate decision by the Kempinski-Hotels administration".
The underlying reason for this move was that the filmmaker got even more angry.
According to Lanzmann, the employee said, "Most of our guests have asked for the removal of the code of Arab and Israelis."
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman described the situation as "a great shame".
We were horrified and surprised by it.
It's a real shame.
It's a much bigger disgrace that this happened in Germany and in a hotel chain like this.
There's no need to explain that.
We expect the hotel to draw the necessary conclusion from this," he said.
The incident sparked a huge reaction online; people described it as a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of "dedicating" to the so-called demands of Arab clients.
Another post was the expression "You should be ashamed", emphasised that the hotel was located near a synagogue on the street of Kurfurstendamm.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel quickly dropped the charges, saying it was a result of "intolerance" and "sorry" from Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung said one of Kempinski's representatives said "there has never been a direct order not to include Israel on the speed dial".
And now they've added the code.
Police used pepper spray and rubber bullets against Brazilian protestors
Students gathered Thursday in Sao Paulo, Brazil, to demonstrate against the government's reforms on the public education system, clashed with police.
Police used pepper spray and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problem started when the police tried to disband the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and pepper spray.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their dissatisfaction with the plans.
Less than 100 public schools will be shut down and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools, according to a proposal from Governor of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin.
Some of the protestors have been seen writing on the walls against temporary President Michel Temer.
This latest protest took place a few days after protesters went out in mass to support President Dilma Roussef, who was suspended by the country's senate vote.
Trade between Russia and Iran rose to 71% - RT Business
According to Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade cycle between Moscow and Tehran has grown by 70.9% annually.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been abolished, Russian businesses in the country have increased their interest greatly, he said.
As new companies prepare to provide access to the market, Russian companies maintain existing ties to Iran.
Of course, increasing trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral co-operation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, he said the trade turn between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856m.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697m.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to 158 million dollars.
This increase in trade was provided by machine, ground tools and equipment for weapons," the envoy said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to come to Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic diplomatic mission in Iran granted Iranian citizens 35,000 visas, mostly for travel.
In addition, Iran was among the top 20 countries to visit Russia for the first time.
We can say that the Iranian tourist record that visited Russia last year will be broken."
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which is something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend that the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd be visited, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are well-placed," he said.
Cash to FETÖ from Izmir - Economic News
Interesting details about Kavallar Group Board of Directors Abdullah Kavuk and Tüçükbay, who were detained for providing financial support for FETÖ, have begun to unfold.
FETÖ's financial sources 1 and 2 in İzmir have been determined that Küçükbay and Kavuk regularly sent a large amount of money to Fetullah Gülen, the leader of the FETÖ/PDY terrorist group.
The money sent to Gülen for the record was not deposited through the banks, but sent through an organizational courier.
On the other hand, nine people who were taken into custody as part of the investigation into the FETÖ coup attempt in Amasya were arrested and seven were released on probation.
Thirty thousand liras in a 10-year term
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's call to "slow down" has been launched.
It was suggested that the banks be included in the campaign attack that the Real Estate started and then GYODER joined.
The proposal was also proposed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to reduce the mortgage interest rates, considered the psychological border, to less than 1 per cent.
13 banks have raised interest in mortgages below 1 per cent.
Public banks started the sale fair.
Based on the latest monthly interest rates ranging from 1.12 per cent to 1.29 per cent, the consumer using a 10-year mortgage will pay less interest between $15 and $30 billion.
TROUBLE 5 INSTEAD 10 YEARS
And how much advantage does interest discounts have to do with the house?
A person who uses a 10-year-old loan of $100,000 will gain an advantage of the lower interest rate of 30,000 liras.
The majority of those who use mortgages choose a 5-to-10-year payment plan.
Interest rates are expected to drop even more in the coming days.
The interest discount will also affect sales.
In 2015, housing sales increased by 10.6 per cent compared to the previous year, making 1,29,000.
Sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million this year with a discount on interest.
GYODER President Saint Torun: It must be reduced to below 9% per year
Public banks going to interest discount is an important step.
They listened to our president's call and downloaded the interest.
However, that rate should go below 9% a year.
If this discount process continues, we're thinking of extending the 0.70-month interest campaign we started for a few months.
Lamb Group YKÜ Attentioned Lamb: Our campaign may last 3 months
The fact that banks are involved in this initiative to bring life to the economy that we limit as a month could bring to the attention of at least three or four more months of this historic campaign.
However, credit interest needs to drop below 9 per cent year-on-year.
It is also gratifying to see that with only the housing sector and its positive psychology and unprecedented solidarity in the real market, every sector has sacrificed in the purchase of housing for citizens.
Polat Holding YKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from banks
It's a good step for them to go to the interest discount on our president's call to the banks.
Other than that, there are steps to boost the economy in all sectors.
The NGOs' campaigns, the Central Bank's decision, and all the steps in that direction are for the country...
All banks need to be able to handle it.
Come to them and join the mobilization, we say, walk along the same path with us, together, to bring the economy to life.
Investing $5.5 billion in a year and a half from Sabancı
Sabanist Holdings increased net profits by 11 per cent in the first six months of this year to $1 billion,353m, with a 22 per cent rise in sales to $1 billion, 166m.
The Sabanist Holding Senior Manager (CEO) Victory Kurtul said they invested $1.8 billion in the first six months of the year, and about $5.5 billion from the beginning of 2015.
"As a country, we've been through a difficult turn recently."
"From now on, it is time for our country to work and produce more."
Take a two-year break from Kabataş's boat.
Due to “Cabaş Square Editing, Transfer Center and Port Restoration Construction” carried out by İstanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBBB), the boat docks were closed to sea traffic for about two years.
There will be a modern transfer center on the coast of Kavataş to integrate sea, rail system and road transport.
Traffic will be underground, providing continuous pedestrian flow along the coast.
The tram and the funicular systems will continue to work for a while.
The ring expeditions will be launched to ensure the transportation of citizens to Taksim, Eminönü, Beşiktaş districts.
The interest is down, the house is up
My friend, the head of a public bank, texted me.
It's always the same.
Interest is dropping, house prices are rising.
Interest rising, house prices dropping.
He says, "That's what happened again."
He tells me about the rumors that came to him because his business was about individual loans.
Contractors entering a 0.70 interest campaign organised by the Real Estate say they increase prices in many housing projects.
I checked to see if there was any truth in it.
There's a lack of status, no more...
Meanwhile, I was reminded of our conversation with a contractor who attended our newspaper's construction summit a week after the Fetullahist Terror Organization attempted a coup on July 15th.
He's the boss of a big firm...
When I heard from the contractor I wouldn't name, I said, "Well, actually, prices need a 10% raise," and I said, "Are you going to do hit-and-run?"
Following the coup attempt, the campaign led by the Real Estate launched a large sales campaign with 0.70 interest and 120 months in date.
I admit, he put his hand under the rock before the banks, took the risk.
But since we're moving with unity and unity to keep Turkey from speeding.
Your one-month campaign was also funded by the banks by reducing interest.
Then no one's looking for a raise.
And warn those who have done it among you.
President Erdoğan accepts Ömer Koç and Ali Koç
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has accepted Ömer Mehmet Koç and Coç Holding Board Vice President and President of Ford Autosan Board Ali Koç.
Erdogan's approval to be closed to the press in the Presidential Council lasted 40 minutes.
Call from BDDK: report those banks
Mehmet Ali Akben, chairman of the Banking Regulatory and Control Agency (BDDK) has issued a statement on President Erdoğan’s warning to "return the credit" against banks.
"We certainly won't allow it if banks turn loan recalling into opportunisticism because of the market's conditions."
We say to those who bring us such complaints and information, 'Give names to the bank and company, and apply to the BDDK complaint line.'
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned banks yesterday: "I say that a new era will open in front of both our country and investors and our banks when interest falls and credit opportunities are expanded."
In this period of our country, I would like to announce that the banks, with false excuses, who called back the loans, have set a line for themselves.
While interest rates were 7–8 per cent per year, the banks made money from these jobs.
More than 500,000 Russian tourists are expected
Professional Hotel Managers Association (POYD) President Ali Kızızıldag said that Turkey-Russia relations took a positive course ahead of the July 15 coup attempt, scheduled flights from Russia to Antalya began and a certain revival in tourism.
"I expect very positive developments for both tourism and agriculture, from construction to food, from construction to all sectors," Reddağ said, adding that the meeting of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin excited the tourism industry as well as trade sectors between the two countries."
Turkey and Russia are very close to each other, and we have traditional relationships based on years.
"I think that if we, as sectors, make too much progress along this path of leaders of the two countries, we can close the distances and head towards the targets as soon as possible," he said.
They predicted that the number of Russian tourists coming to Turkey would have exceeded 1 million if it had not been for the coup attempt, Kızıldağ said.
But we've lost a month in what we call the high season, so the target is going to shrink.
I'm still thinking that if the charter flights start, we'll be over 500,000.
It may also be the end of the season or even the middle of November.
In such a case, additional flights can also be placed towards Christmas.
I'm guessing that this positive weather will be well evaluated by the Russian people as well.
They too have a longing for Turkey.
With this momentum, I hope we can push 700,000.
Reddağ also expressed hope for the Russian market for 2017, saying that if the two countries' relations, as well as the Russian economy, are restored next year, the number of Russian tourists could rise again to over 3 million.
"Returns are being made in the cancelled bookings, new reservations are being started," said POYD President Kızıldag, who said with the lifting of the ban on public personnel.
He said, "We have a hopeful expectation of the feast of sacrifice."
"It would be very good if we could bring in 100,000 people from Iran in 1,2-2 months," Kızıldag said, adding that the ban on ticket sales imposed by Iran after the coup attempt was a very positive development.
Refresh the current loan?
First, talk to the bank where you took the loan, and find out how the new interest conditions have affected your credit.
Compute the cost of using a new loan at a lower interest rate (as much as 1.5.2 per cent of the usual fee) from your bank.
If you still have the advantage when you include all costs, you can apply for low interest credit.
Don't let Aslan breathe!
Beşiktaş, the last champion, aims to win his Super Bowl match with Galatasaray and enter the new season with morale.
"We must play tempo and aggressively."
He used the phrase, "I'm waiting for a high pass percentage from you and 90 minutes for a ball check."
It has been learned that the Senol Sun, particularly Sosa, was uncertain about Adriano and Quaresma, who did not intend to put them in the field.
The seasoned trainer tried Necip in the stoper during the week, but if Adriano plays left-hander, Stoperde Tosic will serve.
Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei will also make a choice, but the Sun also had their students run a ball that stopped after a long break.
Tolga will explode - Sports News
Galatasaray President Dursun Uzbek answered the questions of media members at a dinner held by the NEF, which sponsored Galatasaray the previous night, and supported the foreign football player Tolga Livci, whose transfer cost is also controversial.
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK TO FUTBOLERS.
Dursun Uzbek, who said the football team was much better than last year, said, "However, I should not be the one to talk about it, but the players should talk about it in the field," he added. "I can't say anything."
Two or three weeks, let me see these suits, and I'll give you our shot at the championship.
I'm waiting for an explosion from Tolga.
You'll see Tolga in his posture, in his physical form, this year he's going to explode, and everyone's going to admire him.
The President of Galatasaray stressed that they had contacted Mehmet Topal during the transfer period, but would come into play if he did not sign with his club, and said: "We were not intended to load it so that our opponent could raise the price."
Mehmet Topal is a gentleman, a fine athlete.
If he didn't get along with his club, we'd want to transfer him to Galatasaray.
RIVA AND BANKA BORDERS WILL END
"We wanted to build a hall for 13,000 people," Uzbek said, adding that they will begin construction soon next to the TT Arena.
However, our President said, 'Make a hall of 15,000 people.'
We changed the project.
With the money from Riva, we'll pay off the bank debts.
MAY RETURN US
Galatasaray President Dursun Uzbek, who said he believes his team, who won the Turkish Cup last season, will show its quality in front of Besiktaş in the Super Cup final tomorrow, has made a statement with a slogan at the yellow-red club.
"The Mays are ours," said President Uzbek, adding that Galatasaray believes he will be a champion again after a year.
The departure ban has been lifted
The Club Association Foundation made a historic decision at their meeting yesterday.
A meeting of the July 15 coup attempt, which constitutes the agenda, has reached a consensus on lifting the ban on departure.
From the new season onwards, visiting team fans will be able to take their place in the bleachers at the four major matches and the Besiktaş-Bursaspor matches.
"We have decided to abolish the ban on departures in order to continue the unity and unity formed after July 15th," Foundation President Göksel Silverdağ said.
"We believe that unity and unity are much more important after the July 15th Martyrs of Democracy," he said.
On the other hand, the current board will continue its post as a result of the vote at the Association of Clubs Foundation.
Galatasaray Club President Dursun Uzbek was elected head of the council.
Contrary to previous meetings, the lack of club flags was noted.
The table is equipped with Turkish flags to highlight Turkey's unity and unity.
"We're going to keep our own garden safe"
"We do not have the luxury of underestimating the formation of FETÖ," Association of Clubs President Gössel Silverdağ said, stating that those who have attempted a vicious attack against Turkey's indivisible integrity have found the great Turkish nation in front of them."
"As a football family, we have to clean and tidy our own garden," he said.
"Are you considering an organization under the name of the July 15th Democratic Cup?" he said, "In particular, there are general opinions about the name of the Turkish Cup."
He used the phrase, "We're going to share this offer with TFF."
Target at 25,000 combinations
Trabzonspor will compete in his new stadium in the new season.
Master Muharrem, president of the Bordomavilis, who is counting days to move to Akjez, has determined the combined prices with his survey on social media.
Bordo-blues, who aim to sell 25,000 combines and 100,000 jerseys in the new season, are expected to show a lot of interest in the combinations that will be available for sale.
Master President, "The target is 25,000 combinations and over 100,000 jerseys."
We've agreed with polls on the back of the goal and the east/west stands.
Good luck with that.
He used the phrase "you have the ball now."
The Bordo-blue club's new season combined prices have been determined as follows: "The bottom-of-the-box is $350, the east is upside-down and the west is $750".
The new season form worth 150 lira was announced as a gift to the recipients of combinations, while students will receive 30 per cent and 50 per cent off the second combination to the combine with their spouse.
SOUTH CORALIAR CRIME OPENED
Trabzonspor agreed with South Korean Hyun Jun Suk on everything.
For a year's rent from the Porto club, 750,000 euros will be paid for temporary transfer.
The player will be paid a price of 1m euros per year.
The player's purchase option was set at 15 million euros.
Accounted-book fired
F.Bahce sent Pereira, whose two-year signing was on June 11, 2015, at the end of the first year.
President Aziz Yıldırım and the board of directors held a meeting, including the club's Co-ordinator for Financial Affairs Tamer Yelkovan.
The economic scale of the event was tabled at the meeting.
A deal with UEFA reportedly has been made with Yelkovan, who has been sensitive to keeping "yearly losses" to a level.
Pereira's representatives have been contacted.
He's been notified he's to be terminated.
2-2.5 MILLION TO EURO
There are still some unresolved points in financial matters, so the official statement was stated today or tomorrow.
Pereira and her team went to practice with the team yesterday because there was no official announcement.
The total cost of this operation was around 4 million euros.
However, F.Bajce was said to agree to a figure below that price for termination.
If F.Bardje pays Pereira in advance, it will finish the job for a figure between 2 and 2.5m euros.
If Pereira doesn't agree, her salary will be paid monthly.
If he makes a deal with a team, that payment will be cut.
Yes, in the end Pereira left and the Fenerbahçe fan made a great revolution.
In the war with Vitor Pereira, Caner Erkin, Luis Nani were martyred.
Robin van Persie has been slightly injured.
I'll be glad Vitor Pereira's gone, and I think our administration will find something worse.
My joy remains in my heart.
Now that Pereira's gone, Fenerbahçe is the champion.
Vitor Pereira, you can go with 3-5-2.
To Kadıköy on the 18th, since Pereira's gone.
Serdar Çakır has been relieved of duty
Serdar Çakır, a top-class referee observer at the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), has been called off.
The arrival of Serdar Cakir, the father of our referee, Cuneyt Cakir, who is currently part of the Rio Olympic Games, sparked controversy in the arbitration community last year...
In the past days, the Central Board of Referees (MHK), the Board of Debtation and representatives and observers were re-established as part of the FETÖ.
The smiley face icon from Van Persie
In the minutes that Pereira's claim that Pereira was sacked, Dutch star Robin van Persie made an innuendo on his facebook account.
Robin van Persie, who shared photographs from Fenerbahçe practice, put together a football and a smiley icon.
This sharing was interpreted as "He is glad Pereira is gone".
The first independent gold of history was Al-Deehani's.
Fehaid al-Deehani, the winner of the double trap category in the 2016 Rio Olympics, brought his first gold medal to independent athletes in the history of the games.
The competition at the Olympic Shooting Centre gave out medals in the Double Trap category.
The 49-year-old Al-Deehani, who participated in the games with the League of Independent Olympic Athletics team because of his sentence against Kuwait, met Italian Marco Innocenti in the double trap final.
He was the first to win the gold medal with the independent team of athletes at the Al-Deehani Olympics, which scored 26-24 points for his opponent.
I opened a door for the headscarf
"I respect those who play with bikinis, and my competitors respect their headscarf," said Egyptian Doaa Elghobashy, who fought as a headband at the women's beach volleyball at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
Elghobashy said he wanted to break the perception of Islam's religion in the West in recent years. "I have not had any problems with my head and the Olympics."
The athletes are struggling with their abilities here.
I'm getting positive messages from many countries in the Islamic world on social media.
Especially women say, 'You encourage us, we're proud of you.'
I opened a door for women with headscarfs."
"They understand when I tell them that I wore this dress because of my religion," said 20-year-old Egyptian Elghobashy, who told him that foreign athletes sometimes came to him and asked him why they were wearing closed clothes.
Kazakh Balandin made history
One of the greatest surprises in swim history was yesterday morning with Kazakh Dmitriy Balandin's victory.
In the 200m butterfly, where US swimmers were shown as favorites, Balandin triumphed in 2 minutes and 7 seconds and 46 seconds.
The first swimming medal in Kazakhstan's history, followed by Josh Prenot of the United States, who also won the gold medal at 2:07.53, followed by Russia's Chupkov.
Sun: Let friendship take precedence
Beşiktaş Technical Director Senol Sun has made a noble wish for a fight in the community, saying that the Super Bowl match would be very meaningful because of the anniversary of Suleyman Seba's death.
"In these days, when we need friendship, brotherhood more than ever, I have complete faith that friendship will be in the forefront, not only in the field, but also in the stands," the experienced trainer said.
FETÖ leader Gülen's assets have been seized
In the indictment prepared by Adana Chief Public Prosecutor's Office for Terror-Technical and Organised Crime Investigations Bureau, an indictment was filed against Adana 2nd Heavy Criminal Court for 17 suspects, which has been filed to increase the value of non-regular value of non-registered persons and organizations connected to FETÖ/PDY's zoning plans by an unlawful change.
In the case of defendant No. 1 Fetullah Gülen being tried for “Delaying the Constitutional Order”, the court issued a warrant for arrest against the fugitives Ömer Ekkinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu.
However, for the four escaped defendants who have not been arrested and who have not come to the hearings, the court has decided that illegal proceedings should be carried out.
The 2nd High Criminal Court of Adana ruled that all assets of Fetullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were found in the foreign country to ensure that the case against them would remain inconclusive and therefore failed to reach him, should be seized under Article 278/1 of the "CMK" Law.
The court's decision, along with the move of the fugitive defendants in Turkey, the land-sea and air transport vehicles, all kinds of rights and rights, precious documents, company shares, safe deposit boxes and bank accounts were frozen.
Hüseyin Gülerce: The collapse of Gülen depends on the collapse of three legs
Commenting on FETÖ's coup attempt, Hussein Gulerce made striking statements.
Here are the headlines from Hüseyin Gulerce's statement:
As I thought they'd attempt a coup, I've written in my writing for the last five or six months, "They may be able to identify it, but they can't do it in the chain of command."
I didn't know two things; the first one is that it's common and deep, like the commander-in-chief of the Gendarmerie for eight years and the aides of the President.
Mr. President, the most struggling person, who knows how careful he has been to choose his aides, but the most important aspect of them is a secret that has never been seen.
They're so hypocritical.
"This is not a job for a retired preacher like FETÖ" is one of the most important evidence that there is such a deep conspiracy.
He's definitely getting support from the CIA.
The CIA took this person too early.
In 2014, Mahmut praise said that in 1971 they met Fuat East and Fetullah Gülen at the house of Vehbi Koç.
The people who were most interested in these things at the time say that the relations between the MIT and the CIA were the closest.
The U.S. paid for our armed forces staff, and when they didn't remember that, there was this guy.
When do we learn that, 2014?
And there was no explanation for it after Mahmut Bey's writing.
Like Fair Orphan, caught on base, right?
Wondering who that is.
Guy's been to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the coup, back two days ago.
Fair Orphan has been abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you put all of this together, it needs to be investigated; from March 1999, when all the escapees went to the U.S. of Fetullah Gülen, which one of them went to the United States on an excuse to investigate it.
Apparently, they've taken an occasion to Pennsylvania.
But their real contact with the CIA can be determined from here, especially from people who need to be raised from within the police, there are many people who have been sent safely to the United States.
It's in the Wikileaks documents; Gülen is setting up an association, and this association is having joint meetings with the CIA.
15 years ago, there were efforts to make those contacts with the CIA official.
I told you Fuat Avni was an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The guy who works for the Prime Minister's office works for Fuat Avni.
But what's bad is that this information fell to the CIA as well as Pennsylvania.
Gulen's collapse depends on the collapse of three legs; one is what we call the bottom, which is a friendly ring, and there are those who are deeply hypnotized, and they say even this coup attempt is still Erdogan's film.
Three feet, a base support.
The theft of questions, the theft, the defeat of rights, has shaken this base support.
The other two feet: political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing that's going to break political support is documenting that the tapes of Baikal and MHP executives were taken by FETÖ.
After July 15, Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu used the "FETÖ" as well as opened everyone’s eyes.
Smiley's a poser who says, "I'm not doing it. I'm doing it."
In front of me, she says, "Oh, Mr. Hussein, these students are having very different dreams, they're sending them to me, I've forbidden them, because it's not right to do things with dreams."
A recording was dropped, and Barbaros Bigkurt, who spoke on that recording, had a dream, my teacher, and the Prophet, double the tweets.
One cop has been killed in Nusaybin
According to reports, the armored vehicle, where police officers patrol Saladin Eyyubi neighborhood, was fired with long-barred guns by terrorists.
In the first fire, a police officer was killed, a police officer wounded.
Two terrorists were neutralized in a shootout after the police responded.
The injured police were taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
Operation's in progress in the area.
♪ He kept the coupsters busy ♪ ♪ The TV broadcasts didn't cut ♪
Private televisions, which had a significant stake in preventing the coup attempt on July 15th, continued to broadcast in Turkey thanks to a heroic resistance to the coupeers.
That hero, Asim Akkaya...
"I risked everything because I thought my friends were martyred by the fire from the helicopter," Akkaya said, stating that they had entered resistance psychology on orders to cut the broadcast during the reading of the statement on TRT.
They put a gun to my head and asked me to cut the broadcasts.
I just turned off the local TVs.
Then I got them to move away from the building, telling them we had to go to the satellite dish.
I spent about 20 minutes in the antenna section.
He said, "I cut some wires here again, but I didn't touch the broadcasts."
When the coupsters failed to cut the broadcast in Turksat, he brought experts from Milky Way TV.
These terrorists were caught by police officers who arrived at the scene three minutes ago.
About an hour after the couplings returned to the building, Akkaya stated that he understood that TV broadcasts were continuing, and that he was facing death as follows:
I took over the evening shift at 8:00 that night.
We had it in our hands.
A friend of mine was on duty for the E-state and the electrical system.
When we met for tea around 9:00 a.m., helicopters flew over us on a low flight.
There were a few more aircraft flying low in the vicinity of the helicopter.
We saw the lights.
It was probably drones that could get a visual.
They were flying in front of the helicopters.
I've been there for 11 years, and since it's the first time I've seen a flight this close, I've called the station.
Then there was a movement.
We were looking at the news and found out that the bridge had been shut down.
At the time, our director-in-chief instructed some of the guys at security who weren't on duty to come to the building at the time.
We were on our way to the guardhouse to get information, and we found out that all of your broadcasts on TRT were dropped.
For five minutes, the TRT broadcasts were cut off.
I called the TRT main control, but I couldn't get through.
Our control station said the TRT broadcasts are back and they're starting to read.
Deputy Director Halil Greençimen has requested that TRT broadcasts be cut immediately on the orders of the general manager.
We started working to cut the feed because TRT 3 broadcasts a large network.
We just heard Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım say, "There's a lift-off."
Our director's order to stop the TRT got us into some resistance psychology.
We cut off TRT, and after a while, we heard a helicopter.
We went out, the helicopter that landed in the guardhouse shot everywhere, everyone scattered.
We hid in a building back there.
There were 12 of us.
When we got in the back, the soldiers that got out of the helicopter came in.
Some of our friends were captured by soldiers.
We came out of nowhere so we wouldn't leave them alone.
And that's when I saw them grab our deputy director and get him on his knees.
The soldiers were talking among themselves.
"Let's shoot one of them, let them be afraid."
Then they made us all sit inside.
Their commander started screaming, 'Who's in charge here? I won't ask again.'
And when we heard the "let's shoot somebody" kind of talk, we thought, "We don't know about the country, but we've been instructed to cut off the TRT."
So there's resistance.
That's when I felt like I was giving up my life.
I said, 'It's me.'
At that moment, I stood up, not knowing what to do.
All I could think about at the time was that my friends from the helicopter were shot at.
I thought 10 or 15 of your friends were martyrs in the field, and when I thought, "They're going to kill us eventually," I felt relieved.
The commander in charge said, 'You will cut off all broadcasts except TRT.'
We've got the system section where we monitor local channels as they go up the satellite.
80 of the 200 local channels are coming up from the room in question.
I thought of this room.
There was no national broadcast between them.
If I cut them off and tell them they're all cut off, at least by then, there'll be backup and help from the outside.
Or he could go as far as he went.
After all, we agreed we couldn't get out of there.
I said, "Okay, I'll stop."
I cut off one of the local channel packages from the antenna.
I cut the power switch to monitors where we can monitor national channels.
So all the screens would have no signal.
I told him I had to go to the antennas to get it all cut off.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, and one of the soldiers said, "Stay there."
He put the gun to my forehead.
He said, "You're gonna cut them all off, there won't be any left, I'm gonna shoot one of you sooner or later, that's gonna be you."
And now that I've had enough of my life, I said, 'You'll see when I'm gone, they'll all be frozen', and I didn't say anything else.
We entered the station, and I cut the local broadcasts by stalling.
We've moved to the other antenna.
At that time, I had a system that would correspond to about 20 national channels.
About 20 monitors went down when he cut the local channels.
My Lord has helped us, and We were not forced to respond to them, but He has made them blind.
They believed our answers.
They didn't.
That's a relief.
After they left the antenna, they asked where the transformer was.
I said, "I don't know, I'm a TV publisher." He said, "Is there an electrician among you?"
I said, "No electricians after hours, no malfunctions, the team will come."
Actually, there was an electrician at the time.
It occurred to me that I didn't interrupt the Cyprus broadcasts.
I was thinking of cutting them off to distract the soldiers.
They were a little relieved that they thought the broadcasts had been cut off.
They didn't know how to look at the literature.
The group's on hold now.
About an hour later, when he turned on the TV in the waiting room, they saw the A News broadcast.
He's in, soldier.
He said, "My commander didn't cut the A News feed."
I've been eye-to-eye with the commander.
He said, "Get up."
I'm up.
At that moment, a soldier said, 'There are still broadcasts going on.'
He said, "There are networks in Cyprus."
I said, "They're broadcasting through Cyprus, we can't do anything to them."
He said, "Then after he's written to someone, he's got us all on his feet."
The hit men fled from Turksat in a van.
I saw photos of the soldier who took me to the bathroom and watered me in the seat of that van.
They shot him three times, shot him in the forehead and cheek.
My friends confirmed it was the same soldier.
They called that soldier "son" with us.
It's probably the same one who served as a soldier.
They could have executed him to get rid of him.
According to Asim Akkaya's statements, the first police team came to Turksat from Gölbaşı.
When police teams found out there were helicopters in the area, security guards were being scanned, they went back to the district to buy ammunition.
They came back 40 minutes later.
When police officers arrived, Turksat didn't see anyone at the outside post.
"The police have called us from inside, we are Turkish personnel, we need to get in immediately," Akkaya said, explaining that only three or four minutes after police officers sent so-called experts from Milky Way TV to the building."
"When the police asked for an ID, the four of them rushed to their phones and told them they had been caught," he said.

Fair Orphan's father-in-law spoke
His mother-in-law was taken into custody and sent to court with the father-in-law of FETÖ Adil Orphan, who was considered number one in the July 15 coup attempt.
Father-in-law Cevat Yıldırım and mother-in-law Hatice Yıldırım were released on the condition of judicial control and a curfew.
Speaking at the courthouse exit, Cevat Yıldırım called for his son-in-law's surrender and said: "I am with the state."
Damn the coupeers.
I don't really know the Fair Orphan I've known for 18 years.
I don't have a son-in-law called Fair Orphan.
I want him caught as soon as possible.
This way he can neither live in Turkey nor live in the world.
Let him come, let him trust Turkish justice.
If he makes a mistake, he'll pay.
He's giving us a hard time running away.
Shame on the police, shame on the government.
He's been a cop for 20 or 25 days and he's not doing anything else.
"We don't need the coup, we need work," Yıldırım said, adding that Turkey doesn't want to return to Syria.
We don't want Turkey to end up like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
There's a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He said, "What business would we have with a coup?"
On July 19, at around 3 p.m., Eleksiz, last seen passing through the TEM Highway Akgen toll booths, disappeared after leaving his 'SIR' license plate car in Akızı’s home garage on Akızı.
FETÖ operation to the university: 30 detentions
An investigation into the university structure of the Fetullahist terrorist organization in İzmir was launched this morning. The button was pressed for the operation.
30 members of the university who were detained were detained at their addresses in the operation launched by İzmir Financial Crimes Directorate at Izmir Katip Çelebi University.
Professors are among those detained in the operation carried out by İzmir Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office.
The names taken into custody have been questioned in the Financial Crimes Department.
The search for other names is ongoing.
The detained prosecutor tried to commit suicide
According to the report, the district police department teams wanted to detain Viranşehir Public Prosecutor Ahmet Çiftne in his office as part of the investigation.
After that, he claimed to commit suicide by putting his gun to his head.
Persuaded to the receipt by his co-workers and his wife who came to the courthouse, he gave up suicide.
He was taken into custody to the district police department.
No smoking in parks or sports areas
In the signing ceremony at the Sheik Edebali Cultural and Congress Centre, Bilekek Mayor Selim Yatcı said they had added a clause to the statute of law at the point of no smoking in parks, sports and gaming areas.
The flatterer recalled that he met with all concerned public agency executives to sign protocol for the future of new generations, wishing the protocol to be good for the children and for the young.
Provincial Health Director Yasin Yilmaz has also announced that protocol aims to get people to quit smoking and to remove young people from bad habits.
Following the talks, Mayor Yağcı, Şikh Edebali University Rector Prof. Dr. İbrahim Taş, Il National Education Director Fazilet Durmuş, Provincial Health Director Yılmaz, Provincial Public Health Director Ömer Balcı, Deputy Secretary General of Public Hospitals Serkan Kadir Keskin and Vice President Hilal Savran signed the protocol.
He saw the plot in Ergenekon, killed FETÖ
Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating the role of FETÖ in the mysterious death of Special Operations Director Behçet Oktay, whose case was closed in 2009 as "suicide".
Former Chief of Security Intelligence Ramazan Akyurek, who stayed in the same residence with Oktay and played Oktay under a false name as the suspect of the Hezbollah Terror Organization six days before he died, is a prime suspect in the investigation.
Some of the ammunition seized as part of the Ergenekon investigation is alleged to have been stolen and buried by the FETÖ team at the police station and killed because Oktay detected it.
Behçet Oktay's death, who was found shot in the head on February 25, 2009, was called "suicide".
However, there were many questions.
Two years later, this time a murder investigation was launched as a result of the legal struggle and evidence presented by his family's attorneys.
Oktay, the left-handed one, had the gun in his right hand, which was supposed to have shot him.
There were also fractures to the ribs and signs of blunt force trauma to the body.
The murder investigation was filed in May 2012.
Only Halil Kesici, who was present at the time of his death, was tried.
The incisor was acquitted at the end of the trial.
Nurhan Önder, who was in prison for another crime, sent a letter to the prosecutor and said Oktay had been involved in his death, was sentenced to six months in prison for "accusing the crime and misleading the judicial authorities".
THOSE WARRIORS ASKED
Meanwhile, prosecutor Hüseyin Yalçin, who said "suicide", retired, was promoted to Mustafa Straight Supreme Court, who conducted the murder investigation.
The Oktay family wants these prosecutors and the autopsy prosecutor, Nihat Yıldırım, to be investigated.
Behçet Oktay's sister, Shule Oktay, and her brother, Nezih Oktay, and family attorneys made several demands during the trial.
The family, who said Halil Kesici couldn't have killed special-trained Oktay alone, asked for further investigation.
The family, who said the incident had been covered up, demanded that police officers be identified and tried to close the case of Hüseyin Yalçin and Mustafa Erek and Behçet Oktay as suicide.
While all the family demands were denied, Oktay was found to be a member of the Hezbollah Terror Organization six days before his death, under the false name "Abdurrahman Right".
Police Intelligence Agency Chief Ramazan Akyürek was the one who made the listening.
Following this development, the Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, which re-examined the Behçet Oktay case, began investigating the finger of the Fetullahist Terror Organization (FETÖ) in the murder.
The trial against Oktay's illegal rest will begin on September 19th at the Ankara High Criminal Court.
There's a certain FETÖ in the back.
The Oktay family that SABAH is meeting is hopeful of the current investigation.
Family members say the FETÖ finger in the murder was covered up during the pre-emptive investigation and trial.
Sister Shule Oktay said, "This murder actually showed up."
We couldn't detect it.
Before my brother was killed, he said, "They're going to eat me."
I said 'Who'.
That's when he pointed to FETÖ.
I thought he'd be suspended.
I never thought of death.
Of course the FETÖ is behind this.
"It was in their hands at the time," he said.
The martyr called the young man's family, joined in his prayer
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also called the family of Ömer Can Opengöz, a democratic martyr, through Sinop MP Nazim Mavis, after addressing the citizens in the presidential court garden, during the last watch, during which the democratic watch was suspended last night.
At 1:30 a.m., Father Fahrettin Open-eye stated that he received a call when they were praying for his son. "Our President joined in his prayers."
And he said, "I said that our country and its health were important to us."
'Your Love Is Important to Us'
President Erdoğan addressed citizens in front of the Presidential Council last night.
Erdogan met with some citizens in İlıye after his speech, which ended in the middle of the night.
By holding the hand of an old aunt who was on a democratic watch, he had a one-on-one conversation with the citizens, cared for the children, and thanked the citizens for their sacrifice.
Erdoğan then called Fahrettin Açöz, father of July 15th martyr Omer Can Açöz, through EC Party Sinop MP Nazim Mavis.
"When I told President Erdoğan that we were praying for my son, Mr. President attended with his prayers as he prayed for his son and the martyrs at home at 1:30 a.m., while Omer Açrettin Açöz, 21-year-old student at TOBB University Law School, who was shot in front of the President's College of Justice," he said.
And I said that our country and its health were very important to us.
"We are very pleased that our President called and prayed on the phone," he said.
FETÖ's pyramid was destroyed.
26 FETÖ men were arrested in İzmir Urla.

At the footman, 20 of FETÖ's hygienist sisters were arrested.
24 people, including former Bursa Police Commissioner Ali Osman Kahya, were sent to the courthouse in Bursa.
DOCTOR IMAGINEED
In Edirne, the organization's imam for doctors Aydın Tünbel was arrested.
14 professors at Denizli Pamukkale University, 19 academics at Alanya Aladdin Keykubat University, 2 at Karabuk University, two at FETÖ commander Hilmi Sandal were taken into custody in Rize.
8 judges and prosecutors and 2 deputy governors have been taken into custody in Diyarbakır.
One of the judges was found to have taken custody in the courtroom.
In Batman, Viceroy Sener Ages has been suspended.

The traitor who shot the people was protecting the PKK
For more than 40 years, Turkey has struggled relentlessly to end PKK terror, and it has begun to emerge as a reason why it could not destroy its leaders in its struggle.
The FETÖ militants, who infiltrated Turkey's critical institutions, have worked to tie up Turkey's hands from all four sides.
At this point today, serious suspicion and evidence began to show that FETÖ was behind the events of Hrant Dink's murder, the Uludere, the Russian plane's crash.
The traitor's got a lot on his mind.
It turned out that the record of FETÖ Brigadier General Gökhan Şahin Sönmezev, who led the raid on President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's hotel in Marmaris during the July 15 coup attempt, was very high.
Earlier, it was determined that Sönmezfire had reported air operations to the PKK while the planes were taking off.
A search by intelligence has also revealed that Gökhan Sönmez Fire has a high record.
PROTECT THE TERRISTS
Besides leaking intelligence to the PKK, Turkish warplanes have not yet hit the designated targets.
The MİT's point of intelligence on the PKK's leadership staff was alleged to have been deflected by Gökhan Sönmezev and prevented the shooting of targets.
By changing the coordinates, it was determined that the PKK's fighters, which took off to destroy the leader's staff, hit places on the side of the targets, and so did the leaders of the terrorist group.
The intelligence study found that Sönmezfire played a key role in deflecting targets and before the F-16s took off.
Opening files on 37,000 officers
Reconstruction has been launched at TSK and the Ministry of National Defense following the coup attempt of members of FETÖ on the orders of the terrorist leader Fetullah Gülen.
A comprehensive clean-up process was launched, especially when it became clear that the question of entering military high schools had been stolen by FETÖ and that non-organized military students had been intimidated and sent from schools.
With the latest exports, there are approximately 37,000 officers left of 39,87 officers, while cleaning for generals and admirals will be carried out for these officers.
For that, promotions will be frozen, especially in the ranks of lieutenants and colonels.
A thorough investigation will be completed before the promotion.
The file of 37,000 officers has been opened one by one.
With a hard work, the FETÖ soldiers will be discovered.
Officers without ties to FETÖ will continue their duties.
The battle will continue until the last FETÖ member is cleared, while the promotion of officers will only come after the investigation.
The investigation is conducted together by the MIT, Security Intelligence and State Control Board.
As part of the investigation, they are investigating whether the officers whose files have been filed are from civilians or from the war school, where they have been ranked, where they have been promoted, where they have served, and where their commanders are being investigated.
It will also be investigated by a study that will help them to determine whether or not they are members of the FETÖ.
All measures will be taken to ensure that officers with no ties to the FETÖ will not be affected by the process.
If there's any doubt, that officer will be suspended immediately and sent to trial.
Those linked to FETÖ, who have information and documents, will immediately be cut off from the military.
While promotions are frozen during all this process, the investigation will be deepened.
Further measures will also be taken to ensure that after exports there will be no gaps in the ranks.
With the FETÖ scheme, those expelled from TSK and those who were forced to retire will be able to return to their professions with equal ranks and the same rights as their circuit mates, if they want to go through a security investigation if they want to.
2 thousand 133 SUBAY REPORTED
The General Staff announced the number of staff members of the TSK on July 1st as 39,287 officers.

In the July 31st decree, more 1,304 officers, including 125 Kara and 909 Gendarmerie General Command, were cut off from TSK.
Pehlivanoğlu: Turkesh poisoned FETÖ
Retired Captain Tahsin Pehlivanoglu, founder of the MHP and first president Alparslan Türkesh, suggested that Turkey was poisoned and that someone in the family was co-operating with FETÖ.
"I have not told anyone until today, but I have been forced to talk to the same soldier who saw the image of Muhsin Yacıoğlu pulling pieces from his helicopter and then to see that the same soldier was among the coupeers who were assigned to kill our President," Pehlivanoglu, who was with Türkesh at all time from 1977 until 1997, said.
Here's what Turkesh's bodyguard said:
We went to Germany in 1997.
Three days before we got here, we had the headbutton check-up.
33-year-old Burdur doctor Fikret, checking up, says, "You look like an 18-year-old."
He said, "You've got nothing."
This doctor died of a heart attack for some reason a month later.
On April 3rd, we returned to Ankara.
My brother-in-law went to Amasya.
They called me on the way back and went to an engagement in Ankara Hilton.
After he's out of the engagement, Turkesh says to his driver, Alparslan, "Open the back window."
He would never have opened a window.
When I open the window, it sounds like a bang.
First they did CPR at the Çankaya Medical Center, electrocution, but it was over.
We took him to the Bayyr Medical Center together, but it was too late.
I think someone in the family poisoned him in Amasya.
There was no autopsy on Turkesh.
His ex-wife Seval Türkesh will have heard of my illness and expressions, which he went out to defend as "Turk was murdered" and so on.
A man maketh a grave and openeth a grave.
They called it a heart attack.
Turkesh's tomb must be reopened.
Alparslan Türkesh was killed?
They were arrested for smuggling gold to Pennsylvania!
The operation launched to build FETÖ/PDY businessmen in İzmir was confiscated during its shipment to Pennsylvania, which weighed a kilo (5 kg) of gold.
Searches at the workplace in the operation have found that there are 30 kilos more unique gold that have been kept waiting for Pennsylvania to be abducted.
Following the gold prepared to be sent to Eldem Jewelry, three people detained and sent to prison.
Also detained businessmen Mustafa Özkara, Ezel Elçi Elçi and Elçi Elçi Elçi Elçi were arrested in the operation launched within the scope of the investigation launched in İzmir.
In the operation launched by İzmir Provincial Security Directorate Anti-Criminal Crimes Directorate on July 29, Ezel Elected and Elected were the owners of Ezel Elected and Elected, with Mustafa Ozkara as chairman of the Board of Directors of the Association of Ege and the Businessmen of the Western Transit Transportation Oil and Tur. Tic. Ltd. Şti. (BALPET).
While trying to escape to Kyrgyzstan, ESEC President Ozkara, who was captured at İzmir Adnan Menderes Airport, was determined to be the son of Osman Gürbuz Özkara, who was part of Fetullah Gülen's first board of trustees, and was one of the most important figures in the Aegean region of FETÖ.
Five fuel stations owned by other businessmen Ezel and Ambassador Elçi Elçi were reportedly seized on charges of funding to FETÖ.
They stole a car in an hour and robbed three gas stations.
It happened on Eagle last night.
The two suspects who came to Eagle in the car they hijacked robbed another gas station 300 yards from a gas station on the side road and then another station on the side road with a gun.
After the robberies, the Eagle Police alerted the suspects and launched an arrest.
Police teams have been tracking the vehicle used by C.S. and the U.A.
Indictees began to escape from the vehicle they were using in the direction of the eagle square while shooting at police.
After a foot-long chase, one of the indictees was caught on the Avenue of the Kingdom.
Police have quickly captured the second suspect based on information he received from the C.S.A.
The suspects were arrested and sent to prison after their operations at Eagle Security Bureau.
On the other hand, the masked robbery was recorded by cameras.
In the surveillance footage of the gas station, the suspect first enters the gas station, then enters the market, wearing masks on the outside vehicle, and taking weapons.
There's a struggle between the first suspect in the market and the store employee.
The other person who was found with him after the attack of a grocery worker, he walks in with a mask and a gun to his head.
The suspect who pulled his weapon is fleeing with $6,200 in the safe after disarming the employees.
The suspects' search for the top was recovered about 15,000 liras from three stations, an unregistered weapon and the vehicle they hijacked again.
An earthquake of 7.2 in the Pacific
The U.S. Geological Research Centre (USGS) said that the earthquake, 109km east of New Caledonia Island, was recorded 10km deep in the seabed.
The tsunami warning was cancelled shortly after the earthquake, which caused no loss of life or property.
An earthquake often occurs in Vanuatu, which is part of the "Pacific Ring of Fire" earthquake belt.
He's been praying for the coup without knowing it.
The relatives of 38-year-old Cetin Can, who were killed on the Bosphorus Bridge on the night of July 15th, remain steadfast.
His wife Fatma Can said that while they had not yet heard of the coup attempt that night, she had learned the prayer of martyrdom in a conversation, so she had prayed at home and advised her to do it.
Fatma Can, who told us that they were watching the news on TV at night after the prayer and that they had learned about the coup attempt, explained:
We packed up and left together.
When we got to the bridge, there were people waiting.
As soon as we entered the bridge, the tank fired on us twice.
We took cover, and then when the tank left, we kept walking.
There was a big bus stop on the bridge.
It was crowded there.
We stood there for a while, waited.
When he couldn't move forward, we thought, what should we do?
Çetin wanted us to cross the side lane.
I'm guessing when we crossed the side lane, we became a clear target, and there he was shot.
Four hours after he had performed the prayer, he prayed and was a martyr.
He didn't know about the coup.
God's wisdom.
It's God who gives, it's God who takes.
My wife once said, "If I die, plant a tree that brings fruit to my grave."
I made that wish happen by planting a plum tree over your grave.
Fatma Can said, "God bless him", recording that they owe President Erdogan a debt of gratitude for visiting them.

According to reports, the strikers began shooting directly at the speaker shortly after the raft was read in the mosque.

"We should be interested in watching such a visual feast from space," Esenoglu said, saying that the Persian meteor shower can be watched in July and August.
After all, it's a natural visual feast.
"It will help us to get to know the universe better," he said.
When it's cold, they're red, they're hot, they're white, they're white.
Esenoğlu noted that some of the fragments that were made during the meteor shower would fall to the earth the size of lentils, and continued:
Perseid temperatures could be up to 2,000 centigrades.
Because of the heat and friction in the atmosphere, Perseids produce red light while it's cold in the natural environment, and while it's hot, white light.
Science can be contributed by writing about how many asteroids have been seen on the website of the International Meteor Organization.
This data is information value because it's collected from all over the world.
♪ To be watched all night ♪
Esenoglu, reminding that the meteor shower moves at about 60km per second, said that this visual feast in the sky can be watched through the night, better than anywhere in the northeast.
Esenoglu said more than 100 meteors a year had occurred, and that after the Perseid meteor shower, on December 4th and 17th, the Geminid meteor shower was a nature event worth watching.
Less educated, former football player Erdogan
It was the winning alliance of the less trained former football player Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the largely religious entrepreneur Fetullah Gülen, who founded more than 1,000 schools, universities and educational institutes from Texas to Taşkent.
It's a translation of the sentence from an article published last week at Foreign Policy.
These and similar articles are often included in the Western media, where Erdoğan, a university graduate, is undereducated and former football player; Gulen, a elementary school graduate, is described as a broad entrepreneur of the horizon; Gulen's followers are clearly praised.
"Why is the United States and/or the West opposition rising in Turkey?" they then try to explain in their essays, which began with the phrase "Because Erdogan... "
It is possible to think that analysts who view Turkey's Western opposition as a nevzuhur situation during Erdogan's time are unaware of Turkey's history.
In fact, according to statistics, the first ten years of Erdogan's term can be read as a period when the Western opposition in Turkey has declined or remained on average.
For within this decade, good associations were in sync with the European Union and with the United States.
Erdogan's baseline attitudes, "We don't have to deal with Erdoğan combat against Erdogan in Britain, and the London Mayor of London, who can't imagine what it's like to have a clear policy on the outbreak of civil war in Syria, and to leave Turkey alone in the refugee crisis, while some figures such as European Parliament President Schulz have to fight against Turkey's opposition to Turkey, and why we have to fight against Turkey's special forces, and why its citizens, such as the PKK, are responsible for its opposition to Turkey's opposition to Turkey, and why its citizens, such as the PKK, are responsible for its opposition to Turkey's support to Turkey, and why its support of Turkey's military, should be put to Turkey's military, and why it should be put on the ground by the Syrian authorities.
Let's say, as we lose 247 people in a bloody coup, we forget that our so-called ally, the EU countries and the United States, did not receive any support for our democracy until the coup was proved a failure, that Kerry in her first relevant speech, expected that 'peace and stability in Turkey' would be built', and that she never made any emphasis on democracy and the elected government.
How will it be forgotten that 11 Charlie Hebdo workers were killed in Paris and many leaders from the world, including Turkey, were involved in the protest march, but a month ago, a coup attempt to kill 247 people who resisted the tanks for democracy, yet no president from any Western country, which is 'responsible', has not arrived in Turkey?
What do we say to sending in low-level representatives from the presidents or senior representatives who come several times a year for the refugee issue?
How are we going to go to the EU and U.S. ambassadors for a better-case visit because the Hurriyet newspaper's window is broken and not pay a solidarity visit to the bombed-out Turkish Grand National Assembly?
Is it so unusual that in the first two weeks, the EU sent a high-ranking representative in Egypt, shaking hands with the coup leader Sisi, glorifying the coup regime by saying 'Democracy is being rebuilt' during Kerry's visit after the coup, that the Western countries, which are trying to support Turkey in the democratic resistance, at every opportunity, are not sincere in Turkey?
Even allowing Gülen to live freely in the United States, which 95 per cent of the public consider to be responsible for the coup, is now enough to drive the Turkish people crazy.
And if the background I'm counting above is added to that, I think it's clear that the rising West/American opposition is inescapable only with Erdogan.
And Erdogan hasn't even said he still thinks the U.S. influence is in the coup...
So the trunk was never a conversation.
Do you think it's possible that after July 15th, the wanderers, who look down on their own people, who say, "The Ark is a conspiracy," who don't think like themselves, who insult voters as "the ignorant scratching their bellies," can play the same tune?
After seeing how these people took hold of the state and democracy, did they look for answers to the question, "Where were we wrong?"
But there are so many questions that need to be answered.
The officers who served in various levels of treason until yesterday and who were given the right to use the state's weapons have suddenly agreed to enter the status of a traitor and seek asylum from foreign states.
We need to see what kind of mental distortion we are living in and how obsessions with individuals lead people to conduct what is called a perversion.
As for the attempted coup attempt of watered brains...
For those involved in this demonstration, did Turkey have any perspective other than to compare its cities to the cities of Syria?
Why would an officer bomb his own country's parliament?
We probably shouldn't have made the mistake of waiting for reasonable behavior from brains watered by the curses of FETÖ.
Other people are responsible, but let's know that it's not just FETÖ that's responsible for everything.
As a profession of political strife, hatred and hatred, the staff have contributed to the tragedy.
And the moons that offer themselves as "the morning" have led the masses to believe that all kinds of illegal behavior and even impudence are natural.
We've finally seen how they open fire on this ring when the haters have guns in their hands.
The way of democracy, the way we know it
I say one simple thing: on the evening of July 15th, in Turkey, the people gave 250 martyrs to FETÖ troops, to the FETÖ, to the outlaws, to the sergers, and to build democracy rather than to save democracy.
But on the back of July 15, there are three periods: 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and after.
There are three changes in these three periods: economic, social, political.
Social change prepared two major facts: migration from rural areas to the metropolitan area and moving these nomads to the centre after being held around cities for a very long time.
On Wednesday, I announced that this move was through the subway.
I also stressed that the subway is the most important social change to pass.
The second major change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
The road and bridge's contribution to modernization is easier to understand.
The road comes, the economic and social structure changes.
In our case, it's also changed the political structure.
I've been tracking this date since Istanbul with bridges over the Strait.
Demirel built the Strait Bridge.
This was the peak of the 1950s peasant movement in the 1960s.
Özal continued to advance in the same direction with the second bridge we now changed his name to the July 15th Martyrs Bridge.
Even their pathways indicate the relationship between the environment and the centre.
It's a sign of what kind of social change course you're following.
The purpose of Demirel and Ozal was to melt the masses at the center.
It was to adopt the ideology of the center.
The AK Party did not build the third bridge for many years.
Because the migration was going at its full speed.
The people who came were placed in satellite cities.
A bit of a closed system was created in those areas.
The EC Party's local governments have given people food, work, social status, and they have voted for the EC Party.
So they were asked not to melt at the center, but to develop political consciousness around the environment, and then to come to the center as themselves.
The formation was related to ongoing headdress discussions prior to the EC Party (1992–2002).
These debates allowed the masses to accept the obligation of conservative, conservative and rural people to stand together, not to integrate with the center.
The EC Party acted in the following method after 2002 to politicize the masses, bring them into politics, mature them.
Then, notice now, the democratic struggle on July 15th with the construction of the 3rd Bridge is equal time.
So history and sociology are a match.
I'll add another dimension: the EC Party's move is not limited to the Istanbul bridges.
The more interesting thing is that the EC Party now integrates the surrounding cities with central cities.
This is provided through two bridges.
One, Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, the Çanakkale 1915 Bridge.
Add pathways to that.
Turkey will now reach another route from Thrace to Izmir.
Do you know what this means? Izmir will be a different city from now on.
Let's say that the EC Party is going to take Izmir out of the 'inside' which it can't get.
Now Bursa, Çanakkale, the cities of Thrace will become other human and social geography.
That's it!
The 15th of July martyrs are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie in Fenerbahçe and cheery training
Fenerbahçe continued his preparations for the Grasshoppers game in the early hours of the morning.
The training, which began at 10 a.m. under coach Vitor Pereira at Can Bartu Plants, lasted a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of core practice in the hall, the players took up the field, running and warming, and two-by-five balling and passing.
The training was completed in a tight field with a double goal.
Fenerbahçe will continue his preparations with his training this evening.
The person who complained to the Gülen of St. Lightning...
There's been a new development in Operation Fixing for Fenerbahçe.
"A figure from the sports world has taught Fethollah Gülen his words about him," said Hüseyin Gulerce, a journalist who participated in a programme published in CNN Turk and explained that this operation was carried out by FETÖ.
"One day, lightning said to this person on the plane, 'What are you doing with Fethollah Smilen?"
When this person told Gülen, Fethollah Gülen became obsessed with St. Yıldırım.
Why is he obsessed with St. Thunder?
The president of Turkey's biggest fan club is thinking that he could hurt himself in this mentality.
He used the phrase, "The cause of the cause was to liquidate St. Yıldırım."
Following these words, a statement came from Faik Işık, one of the key lawyers in the Shipping Case.
Light appeared in the Opposite View programme published in Habertürk and announced the person who had reported St. Yıldırım to Fethullah Gülen, the head of FETÖ.
Here are the words of Faik Light:
St. Yıldırım says something to İhsan Kalkavan about Fethullah Gülen.
On a private plane from Azerbaijan.
Mr. Aziz is a funny man, and when he criticizes someone, he says it in Western words.
Those western phrases might bleed a little.
Some may react to those sentences.
These sentences are being brought up somewhere.
Towels, hemmets, all these businessmen going there like they were going to Umre in the Haj is not something to be tolerated.
What do they say? They're very critical.
Of course that's not the only problem.
By the way, there's also a football team tryout.
The direct connections of some football players and executives from the Galatasaray Club, and thank God for Hakan...
Master Muharrem: The matter of fixation is different
Master Muharrem of Trabzonspor has reached out to Fenerbahçe.
"We are on this country's side with 79 million," he said, saying, saying that Turkey's issue is the issue of all clubs.
We need to make a good stand.
If Fenerbahçe has a problem with FETÖ, if it's unfair, I'll stand behind Fenerbahçe.
"But the issue of fixing between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe is different," he said.
Sacrifice prices have been announced.
"As a unit, we have set the price of the live victim's calf at $18," Karabulut said.
He said, "We've also determined the price of the heifer is $17 pounds, and the price of the cow we call second class is 15 pounds."
Last year, Karabulut noted that animals that would not be victims were also being put on sale. He explained what citizens should pay attention to when they make sacrifices:
Especially animals need to be careful about their earpieces.
It's also important that the animal is healthy.
That's why they can check the vaccines on the animal's passport when they're taking victims from our citizens.
And from the looks of it, the victim must be alive and well, and he must have lost his feathers.
And you don't have any signs of saliva or snot on your face.
We've seen non-victim animals being sold and sold over the last few years.
A sacrificial animal has to be 2 years old.
We can tell by looking at the animal's teeth.
A two-year-old animal has teeth that we call a cover.
But the smaller animals, they don't have these teeth.
The animal may appear to be large, but the cap teeth may not have come out.
The fangs are already larger than the others, so they're noticed immediately.
Rize Airport to the sea
The second airport to be built with a sea filling in Turkey will be the Rize Airport.
The Rize Airport will be built on a sea filling 26 to 32 meters from the coast in 26 hectares of the 26 hectares between the village of Yeşilköy and the location of the Girl Tower in Sunday district.
Due to the depth of the construction of the Rize airport, nearly three times the filling will be used at Army - Giresun Airport.
As part of the project, the Apron will be built with a 50-metre-long and 3,000-metre-long runway, where 36 planes can land and take off at an hour.
In general, the Rize Airport will serve passengers and cargo planes, and composition class D is expected to serve aircraft with a heavy turbulence class, which weighs more than 150,000 kilograms [150,000 kg].
The first stage for the Rize Airport project, which will be tendered by the Ministry of Transportation Maritime and Communications Substructure Investments General Directorate on September 8th, will include marine filling, runway, apron, taxirout, environmental highway, police fences, mandirek, PAT courts and environmental lighting.
This is going to cost $600 million.
After infrastructure work, there will also be building work covering terminal buildings, spending $150 million.
The construction of the Rize Airport will be completed in two years and nine months.

Here are the Galatasaray football players from Gulen's chat.
It turned out that Galatasaray and national footballers, who once marked Turkish football, were involved in the talks of FETÖ leader Fetullah Gülen in 1996.
It was said to have been taken in 1996, among the football players listening to Fetullah Gülen's conversation was Hakan Ünsal, Mert Korkmaz, Okan Buruk, Arif Erdem, İsmail Demiriz, Uður Tüküneker and Yusuf Tepekule.
In this conversation, Gulen used the phrase "we scored four goals and won", referring to Galatasaray.
Said Alpsoy, known as FETÖ's former football imam, recently told SABAH newspaper, "Turkey became third in the world in 2002, and the team received bonuses."
Emre, Okan, Hakan, thank God, Hakan Unsal and Arif have raised money from these premiums.
The sum was $250,000 or $500,000.
Arif Erdem took this money to Pennsylvania.
He explained, "The smile then complimented Arif."
National football players attended Gülen's conversation!

Very striking expressions about FETÖ from Robert Amsterdam!
Robert Amsterdam, an official of the Amsterdam&Partners law firm, who investigated the international illegal activities of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization (FETÖ), wrote an article to the US magazine Forbes and shared information on how FETÖ was organised.
Amsterdam said that FETÖ leader Fetullah Gülen led the organisation from his home in Pennsylvania, adding that "it would be clear that Gulen has hidden advanced organizational capabilities under the ground, if we look closely at how he operates about 150 contracts (charter) schools in the United States".
Amsterdam said that seven months ago Turkey was tasked with investigating companies and schools linked to Gulen, stressing that so far what they found is "shocking".
Amsterdam commented on the following views in his article:
According to information from the leaks, the Gülen organization has a strict hierarchy of instructions.
These instructions are usually delivered at face-to-face meetings with Gülen in Poconos.
There's a seven-man management group on the hill.
This group transfers instructions to the advisory committee.
The instructions go to regional imams, country imams, county imams, county imams, district imams in the provinces, neighborhood imams, student homes (light houses) and students.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers work at different levels according to their positions and support within the organisation.
Amsterdam reported that the organisation opened 55,000 businesses worldwide and had the largest contracted school network in the United States, and that millions of dollars were given each year from taxes paid by American taxpayers.
Amsterdam wrote that most of the money was directed among its members and transferred to "chosen" subcontractors.
Amsterdam explained this process with these examples:
In California, Magnolia schools were caught giving $700,000 a year's service contract to a company that was connected to Gülen and shared the same office.
Amsterdam, for another example, showed Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma.
Amsterdam noted that the school also paid the landlord an additional $3.1m and that the school and the ownership company's administrations were made up of the same people connected to Gulen.
The 46 branch Harmony schools holding the biggest spot in the Gulen network noted that similar situations were also being paid with pens, such as software licenses, curriculum purchases, for smaller companies connected to FETÖ, Amsterdam noted.
Amsterdam underlines that the FETÖ makes each other rich, saying, "These examples show that about 28 million dollars of American taxpayers have been misused."
"And this is the obvious part of what we've found so far," he used his statement.
Pointing out that nothing has been done to prevent such events so far, Amsterdam has reminded me that the situation has deteriorated in the past period of time, and that the Texas Education Department has begun to investigate irregularities.
Amsterdam stressed that schools operate normally; many employees do not have information on what kind of corruption they are.
Amsterdam said, "But these schools actually work like snow machines for Smilen."
"Smiler then uses enormous amounts of money to hide his illegal activities", he evaluated for political donations.
"It is believed that Gülen members of the Turkish Armed Forces are also working in similar operations," said Amsterdam, a former American teacher who worked at these schools.
The coup d'etats have strengthened their position over the years.
"But while the military was operating normally, a parallel force was gathering power behind the scenes," he wrote.
Amsterdam concluded his article as follows:
The policy makers in the United States have questions about events from July 15th to July 16th, and that's expected.
However, while two allies address their situation at a diplomatic level, individuals in the state authorities need to wake up in their operations as a series of violations of US law.

Çavuşoğlu’s Zekeriya Öz statement
Çavuşoğlu asked the question of Zekeriya Öz and Fair Orphan who claimed that he had been captured in Georgia, "This information is not true at the moment."
But there are different reports coming in.
They're all being evaluated.
We're in close contact with Georgian authorities.
"Every detail, information, tip is being scrupulously evaluated," he said.
"Zekeriya Öz had fled to Georgia before," he said, asking if there was any doubt that they might be in Georgia.
It was on the cameras at the customs gate.
He knows if he's been to Europe or not.
We're looking at every information that comes to us, not just for these two, but for every other person who escaped, and we're tracking it.
We'll track them wherever they run."
The question regarding meeting with Iranian counterpart Cevad Zarif is: "Double issues have been discussed."
There are many issues between Iran and Turkey.
Political, commercial, transportation, energy, the fight against terrorism.
There are also regional issues.
Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Gulf Region, mainly Syria.
Turkey and Iran can play an important role in solving problems in our geography.
We agree on a lot of things.
Syria's territorial integrity, border integrity, and the removal of DAESH and other terrorist organizations in Syria, we agree on a lot of things, including the fact that there's an inclusive government.
We had different ideas about Assad.
But we're gonna keep talking about this like we always do.
Truce, Geneva, we agree on the continuing negotiations.
It doesn't mean anything unless the consensus on a lot of things is basically results.
"The important thing is to get results," he said.
"Our delegation had gone to Moscow on this issue," Çavuşoğlu said, asking when Turkish planes would participate in operations in Syria.
"The purpose of building these mechanisms is to take steps in the fight against DAESH, especially here, and to prevent any incident from happening, it needs to be coordinated," he said.
"Iran and Turkey are brother and sister countries."
The boards shouldn't decide, so let's make a deal between us.
I had a bit of a website.
We should be able to make these deals before we go to my hearing.
He used the phrase, "We've had demands on gas reductions, prices."
The question regarding the date of Gülen's return to America, Çavuşoglu said, "A delegation from America will arrive on the 22nd."
Meetings will take place on August 23rd to 24th.
Our Justice Department is preparing the case.
As soon as the file's ready, it'll coincide with after visits from the United States.
He said, "We'll go to Washington with our Attorney General, and we'll deliver the files, and we'll discuss them."

Once again, the Turkish people's presence on the streets has proved to be superior to all powers to the will of the Turkish people and the people.
From the early hours of the Islamic Republic coup attempt, Iran has condemned the coup attempt, and has been with the Turkish people and their government in the same way, and has always been.

Seydo Ali Ahmet, who told organisers that they wanted to go to Greece and then Germany, said they lived in Şengal, Iraq, and fled to Turkey because they were afraid of being killed by ISIS soldiers because they were ISIS soldiers.
The illegal immigrant, who says they have a family company in Iraq and speaks German, English, Spanish, Arabic and French, said they were corrupt by the arrival of ISIS in the region, and their only desire was to go to his son in Germany.

Bomber husband caught
According to information, Mehmet Ali Y.'s wife, Kadriye Y., 41, left home with his child about nine months ago due to severe disagreement.
Unemployed Mehmet Ali Y. arrived last night in front of his home in Ulus neighbourhood, where his wife lived, with an improvised bomb, which he had built and supported by filling things such as marbles, nails and firecrackers.
Mehmet Ali Y, who made threats here for a while, then planted the bomb in front of the house and detonated it.
Following the explosion, while residents were in great fear and panic, pieces of ball bearings and nails found inside the explosive also damaged the windows of many houses.
The citizens who fled after the incident called the police who suspected Mehmet Ali Y. of walking around in Yavuzsalim neighborhood dressed in black and backpacked.

Mustafa O. told of the accident, "We were going to visit with friends."
We got our stuff.
We were hit by a car near the transformer near Karadut village, Ezeyir Prophet.
I broke my leg from the impact.
The driver took my friend and threw him in the trunk first.
And then he took me and put me in the trunk of the car with my friend.
While I was putting it in the trunk, my hand was stuck in the trunk door.
So I yelled.
The driver who heard me is the horseman again.
I'll fix my hand.
Your luggage door closed again and took us to Narinje village.
He said, "From there they took us to Kahta State Hospital in ambulances."
When the parents of the injured children first found out that the driver they hadn't complained about had brought the children in the trunk, they complained.
The wounded boy's grandfather Mustafa O. "I was in Kahta when the accident happened."
I just got off the phone with my grandson and nephew who had an accident.

They brought my nephew first.
15 minutes later, they brought my grandson.
Gerger Police Command is here.
The mayor said, "Are you complaining?"
I've had accidents everywhere.
I said I'm not complaining.
Then I went and looked at the car that hit my niece and grandson.
There's a lot of blood in the trunk.
And then we found out that after he hit the kids, he puts both the wounded in the trunk of the car and brings them to the hospital.
He's putting my nephew in the trunk with my grandson on top of it.
And the guys say I didn't put it in the trunk.
But the backseats of the car are clean.
He said, "This can't be happening."
Mehmet Kaya, a resident of Narince Village, said, "The driver who hit the children brought the wounded here."
The kids, the wounded, they pulled them out of the trunk of the car.
He said, "He even did what he shouldn't have done to the animal."
Osman O., uncle of the wounded, said, "What kind of person is this citizen who shot these children?"
Could be an accident, could be an accident.
But taking the wounded to the hospital in the trunk of the car is brutal.
We follow this to the end.
One of these kids is dying.
The other one's in pretty bad shape, too.
He's bringing the wounded from Narince to Kahta in the trunk of the car.
God damn it.
Don't let a wild thing like this happen again.
Our lungs are burning.
We're gonna be litigators, and we're not gonna let this go.
"We want the king to be severely punished," he said.
He built himself an island.
Richart Sowa, the famous architect, spent the last eight years of his life building an ecological paradise that swam.
Using 150,000 plastic bottles, he lives in this self-sustaining habitat with the former Jodi Bowl he met on Facebook two years ago.
Richart's island is made of plastic bottles full of air, wooden palettes and sand.
There's a two-story house, two baths, a hot tub, three showers, a kitchen and a Wi-Fi connection.

With a 30-metre cordon, the coastal island produces its own electricity, water, and Internet with the help of this cordon.
Sowa, "I'm a vegetarian and I grow a lot of edible vegetables on the island."
I have to go to the convenience stores nearby to get to other foods.
He said, "I've got another eight-man raft made out of plastic bottles."

Thank God and his father's 200 million assets have been seized.

Police took action after Selmet Hallelujah was reported to be at Friday prayer at Salko Mosque on Sakarya Street, Adapazar.
Teams on their way to the mosque waited for Friday prayer to be performed.
After the prayer ended, Selmet saw the police and raised his hands.
Selmet, who had been arrested, was taken to the Police Department.
Thankfully, Gökhan followed his father to the squad car where he was taken and drove to the front of the Police Department.
Sakarya Chief Public Prosecutor's Office has determined that Hakan Hallelujah and his father Selmet have provided financial support for FETÖ.
The Criminal Judgeship of Peace, Hakan and his father, who examined the prosecution's application, decided to confiscate the movers, land transport vehicles, bank or other financial institutions, any rights or rights that they would receive from real or legal persons, valuable documents, partnership shares in companies, safe deposit boxes, and other assets.

Pay attention to children’s habits
Professor Dr. Bilgen Giray of Dental Medicine said that children were relieved by this reflex by making it necessary to suck because they couldn't chew at their early age.
Doctor Dr. Giray, who lists the reasons for children’s finger-sucking habits, says, "A finger sucking is an event from birth to age 3-4."
Most babies suck their thumbs.
A child who sucks his finger to satisfy the need to suck when he's a baby sucks his finger to ease the craving for a mother's breast after he's 1 and a half years old.
He said, "When he's bored and distracted, when he's sleepy, when he's nervous and when he's separated from his mother, he can act as a finger-sucking act."
Emphasizing that insufficient maternal and child-satisfaction is the basis of the older finger-sucking behavior, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Bilin Giray described the effects of this behavior on dental health:
Finger-sucking behavior has a negative effect on the shape of the child’s dental structure.
As pressures arise during suction, the upper teeth are pushed forward, while the lower teeth are pushed back.
Which causes the lower jaw to be positioned back, destabilizing the palate and dental structure.
The physiological reflection of this is that speech disorder and closure look aesthetically bad.
"We can protect our children from closing and joint problems before jaw development is complete," said Dr. Giray, who noted at the age of six or seven, when permanent teeth start to emerge.
"That's why today's oral structure, like children's eye and hearing controls, needs to be controlled," he concluded.
New breath in close vision treatment: Trifocal Lens
After cataract treatment, patients naturally don't want to use glasses.
For many years, multifocused lenses have already been used to solve this problem with our patients.
The recent use of trifocal lenses has taken it one step further than the success of treatment in this area.
The difference between trifocal lenses and other lenses is the ability to have a clear view not only of distance or close distance, but of distance.
Treatment for remote, close or inter-range vision disorders
A distance in vision disorders represents a point we often use in our daily lives.
For example, the gauge panel of the cars is the distance between the distances we define as the portable computers that we hold in our laps or the length of a 60-70 cm arm.
And with the trifocal lenses correcting the distances, our patients don't need to use glasses in any way that's close or far.
Another advantage of the trifocal lens is that it reduces complaints at night.
"Every distance is no different from the normal cataract treatment of trifocal lenses for vision treatment."
The patients we're treating with trifocals will have a seven-to-ten-minute procedure, and they'll be in good health.
And the next day, our patients can go back to their normal lives.
It's an operation that improves the quality of life for people who drive, who use computers, who like to read, and who live a more active life.
You can also apply to an ophthalmologist to see if this procedure applies to any patient who has reached 18 years of age.
An heirary vein is not used for heart surgery!
In recent years, the heir is a very frequent disease.
When genetic intimacy is the primary factor, long working hours, jobs that require long standing, and long-term complains of inheritance.
Are veins used in heart surgery?
I have an heir, and questions like what happens if I have a heart attack in the future are often asked by people.
Here are the answers to these questions.
There are two types of veins in the leg:
1. The leg has a deep vein system that takes dirty blood to the lungs and collects what we call the main pathway to the actual dirty blood of the leg.
They're called deep femoral vein and surface femoral vein.
The problems in these veins are rarer, the vessels can't be shut down, and drug treatments are used to keep these vessels open.
The leg has a superficial vein system that leads the dirty blood to the lungs, which we call a lateral pathway to the deep vein system in the groin.
This system consists of two large and two small pure venous veins.
In four of these vessels, failure and the heir may develop.
Arterials that can be used in heart surgery are superficial veins called large puretane ven.
The absence of these vessels does no harm to the body, and therefore they can be used in cardiac surgery.
But these vessels need to be healthy to be used for heart surgery.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
Surgical removal of the heirous vessels or burning them with lasers will reduce the workload on the deep veins and improve the health of the leg.
A misbeliever among the people is that veins can be used as replacements, even if they are heirs.
The varicose vein is never used in cardiac surgery!
There are other vessels that can be used in heart surgery.
Reservist vascular systems can be used for heart surgery are found under the ribcage, around the stomach and in the arm.
Thus, it is not necessary to keep the heirous vessel waiting for the heart and to worry about it.

A meaningful message from Uzbek before the Super Bowl
Galatasaray Sports Club President Dursun Uzbek issued a statement ahead of the Super Cup Final between Galatasaray and Besiktaş.
Here are the words Dursun Uzbek drew attention to the unity and unity of Turkish football:
Galatasaray and Besiktas, the two main clubs of Turkish sports, will face the Super Cup at Konya Metropolitan Torku Arena on Saturday (August 13th).
This is neither the first nor the last match in our two distinguished clubs' competition to leave a century behind.
But it's a crucial encounter in the timing.
As we all know, our country suffered a great deal on the night of July 15th.
The coup attempt of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization/Parallel State Construction (FETÖ/PDY), which is intent on our democracy, has been overcome by unity and unity of all segments of society.
That night, as a nation, we paid a heavy price.
We've given martyrs.
We have a lot of gas.
This painful price reminds us once again of the virtue of democracy, not of fighting in this land, but of the necessity and importance of the rule of peace.
On that night, representatives of Turkish sports opposed the coup as one voice, one heart; all together sided with democracy.
In these critical days, we need the unifying feature of sports more than ever.
I wish that this match, just before the new football season, named after our club's legendary captain, Turgay Sheren, would be the beginning of love and peace in Turkish sports.
At the end of the game in front of the bleachers, where Galatasaray and Besiktas fans will split 50-50, I hope that no matter what the score, the winner will be our country and Turkish sport.

As Britain closes its gold, Scot Callum Skinner flies home.
While the Great Britain Team trio defended their title from London in 2012, Scotland's Callum Skinner competed in the men's race at the Rio track last night.
Glasgow's 23-year-old racer, Sir Chris Hoy of Scotland, took up the pioneer role, and this young man prided himself on returning home victorious with his appreciated New Zealand suit.
Four years ago, when Hoy received five of the six Olympic gold coins, Britain had received a shocking victory.
And even though Hoy retired, they repeated it by finishing in sixth place in the London Race World Championship in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of expert starting player Jamie Stafford.
They did it right when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
He had foreseen the potential that Scot had now achieved, and British trainers hadn't given up on Skinner.
He and Hoy won the Olympic record four years ago, although Hindes, Kenny, and Skinner set the Olympic record in the final round, New Zealand re-set it in the first round.
And the British trio fought for gold.
Hindes was a little behind on his tour, but Kenny put the team up front, and Skinner took it.
This was a strategy shift, a large part of the transformation that made Kenny and Skinner keep pace, using a larger vehicle to slow him down.
Hoy followed them as the BBC's expert commentator and caught Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' eye when they got on the podium.
From Glasgow, 23-year-old Skinner said, "This is an honorable comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make my name known.
We broke the Olympic record in the finals and beat the world champions.
That was really amazing.
There's no better way to win this.
In 2012, Hindes admitted that after winning the victory with Kenny and Hoy in London, he deliberately fell on the track after a bad start.
He then responded to this comment, and there was no way to make demands on Britain's competitors.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
Hindes said, "It was as if we were in London with all the Great Britain flags at the station."
We're just a team that was formed three months ago.
We've lost too many world races, so it's really amazing to have won again at the Olympics.
This is just an event, a medal for a nation that won seven out of 10 races in Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of progress we've made in the last five months, we have five more days of success at the racetrack.
Kenny's attitude shows that Hoy's dream of repeating three gold records in one Olympics is not impossible.
This would mean that Kenny, who was 12 years younger than Hoy and was born on March 23rd (also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister, a British sports past sacred date), received six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's the same level as Hoy.
Kenny, from now on, he's gonna be in the sprint race, starting today, and it's gonna be three days.
"For now, I'm just enjoying this.
Team events are always the best events.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, when you win alone, you feel lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
Although it's just the event of today's medal, there's a lot of good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished first in the four-mile team race.
They completed the runway in 3:51.943.
World record set by the gold medalist in London 2012: 3:51.659.
The first round and final (22:42) will be determined in the second episode of today, and Wiggins will certainly draw all attention to himself.
Yesterday, prior to the qualifying round, the authorities had a disagreement with the officials when they called him to measure his height.
At the women's event that will continue tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavie reached the world record for 4:13.260.
In the middle of the Olympic Games, the Great Britain Team relys on the strong bicycle team to take the reins and win many medals.
After great superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were greatly reduced in Rio.
There have been a lot of bad developments in the background including the resignation of coach Shane Sutton in April and the retirement of important figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, due to allegations of sexism and bullying.
But on the first night after the race on the track, it shows that Great Britain's epic reputation for finishing in perfect time will be proved again.
The cancellation of the energy contract and the future of the Portland tannery are doubtful
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria and the work of hundreds of workers fell into uncertainty after one of the facility owners announced the termination of a supply contract, which would result in the cancellation of all supply contracts from the energy company that provided the facility.
This movement emerged earlier this year after Victoria's government's decision to keep the facility running so that the subsidies would not be breached.
20 years of fixed subsidies expire in November.
At Alcoa's Portland facility, work could be at risk by 2000.
Any shutdown could lead to a direct or indirect risk of up to 2,000 jobs.
And there may also be additional chain effects because the instigation furnace consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa Point shut down Henry's burner, which resulted in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland facility is losing money, and it's at risk of closing down.
These developments began following speculations for the future of the facility over several years, based on the strengthening of the Australian dollar and the recent consumption of the plant.
The AGL provided energy from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley to the large aluminum furnace, and said it expects the other three owners to move towards terminating their contracts.
The majority of the facility belongs to Alcoa and Alumina's joint venture, and China's CITIC, Japan's Marubeni Corp companies have smaller shares.
"The AGL expects the Portland facility to continue working, which means that the plant's demand for physical electricity will continue," he said.
AGL said the contracts are "risk balancing contracts" that must be implemented from November 2016.
The contracts will be completed in 2017, since they are a 12-month period of termination.
"Therefore, the AGL will continue to expect contracts to contribute to the fiscal year 2017," the energy company said.
The effects of the AGL on the 2018 Financial Year and future potential gain are present, limited to the adoption of a strong-term contract stance for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL has already stated that its contracts in their accounts have dropped by 187 million dollars due to the "prepared feshin".
Alcoa said the decision on the termination of the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate or supply electricity to the hot spring".
The US company signed a 20-year contract in 2010, which was supposed to take effect in November this year, but has yet to explain why it has not withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are alert to the possibility that both the Portland burner in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle will be closed due to economic difficulties in the sector.
Stephen Mikkels, director of operations for the AGL, responded to analysts earlier this week, said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts every year, and Tomago uses 900 megawatts of energy every year.
If both of these facilities are removed from the market, the demand for the [electric] market will drop significantly.
And it's not good for us as a producer."
Not just the star of the Kardashian TV show; Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
Kendall Jenner (20) is the fourth daughter of Kris's Kardashian-Jenner group, the model and executive mother.
Kendall, a Estee Lauder ambassador and starred in fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced this report on Thursday from the Instagram account.
Kendall wrote, "I cried when I looked at this door in a room full of people I loved."
After the cover was announced, the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (which caused trouble in the bar), Rob and Caitlyn, and everyone's favorite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest), released a strange reality video with scripts (or just unique to the Keeping Up with the Kardashians program), which later prepared a classic party.
It's a cliché storyline for almost every "birthday" episode of all children's television shows (Seacrest at 8:00 a.m. a cartoon rabbit can honestly say, "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" Kris had to include other girls in the introduction somehow.
With this development in Vogue's September issue, we've certainly entered a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have passed him over to the cover of Vogue (in April 2014 he shared the cover with his wife Kanye West) but the September cover of the magazine was a success.
Vogue's September issue was the best-selling issue of the year.
The thickness of a coffee table book rather than a fashion magazine attracted the attention of many advertisers (Fashionista found that 615 of last year's 832-page volume contains advertising content).
The unveiling of the cover star is also a closely monitored process; over the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Women previously on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover includes celebrities who make more models than famous models.
The Oscar-winning Dior envoy Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and the following year the honor was granted to Lady Gaga.
But even if Miss Jenner, who was described by the magazine as the shining model of her generation, was put into the previous category, her surroundings were quite good.
These celebrities are not celebrities, relatives of celebrities, or reality show stars, or young people today who know how to make good Snapchat videos.
These are all women who stand out in the entertainment industry, whose talent is legitimate.
On the cover of last year's cover, Beyoncé spent one of the best moments of her career with Lemonade's release.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
With the reality show history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be disturbing.
In June, he criticised the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour, Jenner, and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of time".
When news came out that Jenner was going to be on the cover of Vogue, that thought came out again.
However, focusing on dissatisfaction seems unfounded.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He's literally a supermodel.
He's doing Marc Jacobs' shows.
Estee Lauder's getting you some foundation.
He's selling his own pictures of himself in pay-per-view apps with his sisters.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter he's taking pictures of in LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, maybe he's just on a reality show to see his brother Kourtney and his kids.
Social legal support centres turn down 160,000 people every year
As the sector prepares for the impact of further funding cuts in the already difficult operations, more than 160,000 people from the most vulnerable part of the nation are turned away from social legal support centres.
Three out of five people in Queensland (mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence and those without resources and others to deal with unfair eviction decisions) are rejected in search of free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services, which have exhausted their opportunities, are preparing for further interruptions.
Starting in June next year, these legal support centres are scheduled to be deprived of more than 30 per cent of federal funding.
Director of the Queensland Centers for Social Legal Support, James Farrel, reported that thousands of people have been turned down every year in the latest Census Report of the Community Legal Support Centers.
Mr. Farrel said the situation would be much worse if the federal government decision was not reversed.
"Queensland's social legal support centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people can't achieve the vital services they need," he said.
People in violent relationships, who are struggling with power and backbreaking forces, families in the separation process, and workers who have been unfairly laid off, they all face problems with legal dimensions, and according to this report, they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent as of June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will be forced to deal with more complicated legal problems without assistance.
We urge the Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to withdraw these funding cuts immediately so that people can get the support they need when they face a legal problem.
Last year, the government fulfilled its promise to raise legal support financing to a national average.
We need to look at social legal support centers and the communities they serve and the investment of the Palaszczuk government in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team was sued after the crew claimed to have pulled a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team was sued for no action after the director of North Carolina operations was told that he had pulled a gun on a staff in February while driving around in the jeep.
The case was released Wednesday by former software instructor Vincent Bordini of the state campaign team.
Bordini said he expected months on the inside to deal with the situation, but then realized "that's not going to happen".
As Bordini reported in his complaint, the director, Earl Philip, pulled out a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and held the barrel against Vincent's kneecap.
According to the complaint, Bordini learned that at least four others had the same experience as Phillip after complaining to local and regional campaign leaders.
Bordini complained, "The weapons don't need to be fired to do damage."
The case opened two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger, saying he could act on the crowd in North Carolina in the event of his opponent Hillary Clinton's election and electing his judges, as it turns out "the second constitutional amendment people are gun owners and gun supporters".
Trump's campaign team said that the media took those words outside the context and that it did not support violence.
Bordini, with his complaint, is seeking compensation from the campaign team for oversight negligence and for assault, battery and moral damages.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not quickly return the message that asked him to comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip have failed.
A local news outlet in Charlotte, WCCB, reported Phillip's recent departure from the campaign.
The call to his consulting company, the Innovative Consulting Services, has not been returned quickly.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial campaign.

"Report FETÖ" line
Following President Erdoğan’s call to inform on FETÖ members, “not everyone may know intelligence, not everyone may know security, not report”, MIT and Security have set up a hotline for FETÖ.
Following the July 15 coup attempt, new practices are being launched to identify "secret parishioners" who have been hiding themselves while thousands of FETÖ members have been expelled from institutions.
As part of the work, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emphasised the importance of the citizen's calls in the fight against FETÖ, saying, "You may have friends in that community, I say you must expose them."
You need to report it to the DA's office.
It's a patriotic debt.
He said, "Not everyone can know intelligence, or safety, or not be able to reach it. Look, they're running away."
An online tip has been launched by the Ministry of Interior, Security Directorate and National Intelligence Agency (MİT).
According to this, he will be able to transmit to security and MIT those who serve the FETÖ around him, the organisation he knows, the institutions that belong to the organisation.
www.egm.gov.tr/pages/portraits, www.mit.gov.tr/tr/your service links will keep the information of those who will report to the service via the form presented.
In the report submitted by the Security Directorate, those who want to add documents can also add.
In the same application, he will be returned if the whistleblower asks for it.

When we started this project, we looked for a role model.
When we got to the basement, we noticed the white paint and blue window view of the houses.
So we wanted to take the example of the basement because of the white cleanliness and the positive effect on people.
By doing our work, we had every house in Canköy painted white and blue.
This work was done by government and charitable cooperation.

The entity fund whose audit has been discussed is back on the commission.
Turkey's Entity Fund, which is expected to be among the world's largest funds, has been removed from the law after objections.
Due to the lack of the fund's control mechanism, it has been decided to meet again, but no changes have been made in the commission.
"We are strongly opposed to the fact that this structure will be kept outside of constitutional control mechanisms, which will consist of the public's assets, labourers, employee pension cuts, unemployment funds for unemployed people," CHP MP and Plan and Budget Commissioner Utku Çakırözer, who evaluated the AKP's proposal to sozcu.com.tr.
Turkey's Entity Fund, which the government has prepared to provide long-term funding for investments and projects, was removed from the bag on Tuesday, with the opposition's opinion that it should also be discussed.
However, today the AKP brought the proposal back to the Plan and Budget Commission, as it so happens.
Eskişehir MP Utku Çakırözer, a member of the TBMM Plan and Budget Commission, told CHP about CHP's concerns and concerns regarding the Proposition of the Entity Fund law.
"When the establishment of this fund came to the Plan and Budget Commission with a bill for bagging, our former Finance Minister, Zechariah Temel, who was head of the CHP delegation, expressed our concerns and concerns, and suggested that it be removed from the bag law and also discussed in detail."
The government, who accepted our view, withdrew the bill.
The bill came to the commission again yesterday as it was.
"The government seems to insist that this be removed from parliament within a week," he said.
"Our biggest concern in this proposal of the law is indiscriminate," he said, adding that there should be an agreement on the adoption of the entity fund law.
"The public assets, the workers' mandatory pension cuts, the unemployment funds collected for the unemployed, incomes from privatisation, are being handed over to a structure outside of Parliament and the Court of Auditors and without any responsibility," he said.
"But we have a savings deficit," he said, stating that Russia, China and the Gulf countries have oil revenues and more than trade and that this is how the fund is funded."
That's why the fund will be made up of public funds, public funds.
A total of 100 billion in unemployment funds are planned to transfer 100 billion from the individual pension fund forced into employees, 50 billion from privatisation.
"So this fund, which will be formed entirely with the public's money, must be under public control, and this money should not be spent irresponsibly," he said.
Çakırözer stressed that it is unacceptable to keep a trust out of Parliamentary control that the state's resources are being collected and the government's assets are guaranteed in debt, and expressed concern and concern about the offer of the Entity Fund law:
Jobs and transactions regarding the collection, spending, public debt of such a large public presence cannot only be passed by the control of independent auditors.
There has to be a public audit and a transparent structure.
There are no provisions in the law proposal regarding the Constitutional audit and transparency of the entity fund.
There's no limit on how much resources will be transferred.
No one will be able to account for how this fund was used.
The Fund's aim is to finance major projects.
There's no need to set up an unsupervised fund outside the budget.
Why don't you put it in the budget?
And so naturally, the question comes to mind, "Why is the Count and Assembly absent from control?"
They are not opposed to the transfer of savings to investments at the Wealth Fund, but they are opposed by non-transparent, non-responsive mechanisms. "Is such a funds needed to be discussed?" he added.
But if the government insists on it, then we have to make sure that the valid international standards in other countries where such investment funds are established are also valid in Turkey.
It must be configured in some way that the mechanism of control and responsibility is brought in.
It needs to be built so that there will be no doubt about it, so that it can account for its own money.
"We are pleased that the AKP is listening to our criticisms in Parliament, especially after the July 15 coup attempt," said Çakırözer, under the circumstances of the entity fund's law proposal to the commission.
In this law proposal, we hope the AKP will listen to our constructive criticism.
We're against the use of national beings without rules, the transfer, the irresponsible use of them, and the lack of public supervision.
"The Requested Wealth Fund can only be useful if these concerns are resolved," he said.
The proposed law has been found to have been working to reach a compromise between the AKP and the opposition.
"Our confidence in Turkey is our investment"
"Our $30 billion investment in the last five years is a sign of confidence in our country's future," said Ali Koç, chairman of the Ford Automotive Board in Istanbul at a meeting.
Coç Holding Executive Board Vice President and Ford Automotive Board Chairman Ali Koç met with director of several foreign capital companies at a meeting on "Those who trust Turkey, those who produce Turkey" organised by the Istanbul Industrial Chamber (ISO).
"With our partners, we not only express our faith and confidence in our country, but we fill it with our investments and action," Ali Koç said at the meeting.
The $30 billion investment we've made in the last five years is a sign of confidence in our country's future.
The necessary issues for Turkey to attract more foreign investments are a reliable and fair legal system, a democracy of international standards, a qualified workforce and an ecosystem that encourages innovation, entrepreneurship and addition.
In the last few years, our government has presented our industrialists with the most comprehensive incentives in our history of the Republic.
"I believe that with these incentives and holistic strategies, we will be able to launch a new "instruction move".
"Now we know this as global actors, not just one country's problem," said Huseyin Gelis, chairman and CEO of Siemens Industry and Trade Turkey's Board.
We came to Turkey with a long-term look.
As long as we're united and united, our problems will be solved.
We were able to bring what couldn't be in Turkey 160 years ago to this land.
We will continue to be in these areas in Turkey.
"Of course we'll build factories, but we have to be clear in this area."
"Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for Shell," Shell said, adding that Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for Turkey's country President Ahmet Erdem.
We truly believe in Turkey's potential and future.
We've invested in many fields, especially energy, and we're still doing it.
We thank our President, our Prime Minister and our Ministers for their support of international investors.
It is a reassuring work for international investors.
"This is to increase our country's competitiveness," he said.
Sandoz/Novartis Turkey and Central Eastern District President Dr. Altan Demirdere said "On August 10th, our Global CEO would come to Turkey."
But the trip has been postponed.
That's what we objected to.
Because the CEO's arrival was very important.
They made requests for bulletproof cars, protection.
And then when he came here, he saw that everything was normal.
He left the guards and the car and went home happy.
Investment in a country is like marriage.
First, the promise is, if all goes well, you'll get engaged and get married with a long-term plan.
We're married to Turkey, and we have no intention of divorce.
Back from the edge of the cliff!
Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım spoke to his businessmen by teleconference at the consultation meeting on "Those who trust Turkey and those who produce it in Turkey" organised by the Istanbul Industrial Chamber at the Swiss Hotel.
"We must not miss the transition to 'Industrial 4.0' in the industrial sector," Prime Minister Yıldırım said, expressing that Turkey's industry is the industrial sector that will achieve comparisonal superiority.
"If we care about becoming our country's locomotive and catching its 2023 goals, we need to think about the industrial revolution with the IT and technology revolution and do that as well," he said.
"Those who mean the future of our country, those who are trying to destroy democracy, those who are not afraid to bomb our VA, if they were victorious, we were talking about another Turkey today," Prime Minister Yıldırım added on the night of July 15th.
We were going to talk about a Turkey that had been taken over by the coup, that had been removed from the national will, and that had fallen out of the world's developing league, among the third world countries.
"Thank God, with the authority of our nation, our commander-in-chief, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan's resilience and the determination of our government, we removed this scourge."
"We will quickly get out of the influence of this incident and move forward," Prime Minister Yıldırım said.
It's never, ever right to live with a constant coup.
We have very ambitious goals ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not shake Turkey's economy.
Those waiting for chaos and crisis were once again wrong.
Today, both our democracy and our economy are intact.
Our banking sector, our financial sector, continues to work in good health.
The foreign trade deficit fell by 25 per cent in 2015.
The national income rate of the current car deficit was 5.8 per cent in 2014, and in 2015 it dropped to 4.5 per cent.
We aim to bring it down to four by the end of this year.
We will never change our firm position in public finance.
Turkey's 2016 budget also exceeded the national income of 130 countries.
In 2015, we reduced the national income rate of the budget deficit above 11% to 1.3 percent, and we're trying to maintain those rates.
We're better off in public debt than the EU, than most countries in the world.
Our banking financial sector is working on a solid ground.
"Our Central Bank did not need to exchange the market despite July 15th, and there is no reduction in our reserves, we have over $1121 billion gross reserve."
"We are also making comprehensive arrangements to free you from the burdens of the past," Prime Minister Yıldırım said, citing the development of the economy, the growth of production and the ease of new jobs."
We've implemented a lot of arrangements, and we've continued to implement them, until we've come up with a loan that's not paid for, and it's paid off again, and it's paid off.
"Keep producing for the country, keep relying on your country, and your government will continue to remove the obstacles ahead of you one by one," he said.
Hakan's father was taken to hospital for high sugar.
Hakan's father Sermet, who was detained as part of the operation against the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization in Sakarya, was taken to hospital due to the increased sugar during the interrogation.

Turkey does not leave the West, it does not give up European Union
Mehmet Simsek: Turkey does not leave the West, it does not give up European Union
Vice-President Mehmet Simsek, Science Industry and Technology Minister Faruk Özlü attended a meeting organised by Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci İstanbul Industrial Chamber (ISO) on "Those trusting in Turkey, makers in Turkey".
"I think there have been many good results from the developments on the night of July 15th and after," Science and Technology Minister Faruk Ozlü said at the meeting.
The most important of these is, without a doubt, the spirit of unity and unity that all of Turkey now feels deeply about.
The July 15th process showed how strong the Turkish economy has dynamics, and that society has internalized democracy.
"For a society that has achieved this level in economics and democracy and democracy, it is clear that the next process will move better and easier and faster."
"It's necessary for Turkey to be saved from this pain"
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, who said they were having trouble telling the world about the July 15 coup attempt from Faruk Özlü, said they have declared mobilisation as a government.
"If 63.4% of the first five sides of my real sector are going to interest, we should give up all our work and concentrate on it."
That's why our President is going back and telling us.
With the real sector, with the banking system, with its government, with its politics, after the July 15th civil Turkish democracy revolution, Turkey needs to be free of this boredom with unity and togetherness of politics.
We welcome recent developments in this regard.
"Hopefully, we will be able to sustain, sustaining, hopefully, by supporting this competition, which, in the coming period, began with the encouragement of our president, with a zero-point-point-nine-eighths start-down as well as as as as economic management."
"THE GREEN PASAPORT, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE OUR RESIDENT AMERICA"
"In the next period, win the world, we will be scoops," Nihat Zeybekci said. "We will not leave a country ungoing in the world, not without a knock on the door under the leadership of our president, our prime minister."
We're not leaving anyone we haven't contacted about increasing our trade.
"We will never, ever ignore that; we will not be the birds we have when we chase the bird in the branch," he said.
Zeybekci also said that later, exporters would be given green passports, saying, "One of the most recent decisions is that his law has been passed, and we have now completed regulations in the economy ministry; we will give our exporters, approximately 17 to 20,000 of our first figures, a privileged green passport representing this country, to command our exporter."
"THE CONTINUES OF THE INSTITUTE"
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, who referred to the coup attempt on July 15th and after the declaration of OHAL, said, "But it is behind us, we need to move forward."
"Of course, those who are involved in this coup must be removed from the state and this process is working; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms were needed to avoid further coup attempts," Simsek said, saying, saying, saying that the two simple reasons were declared OHAL.
And as a climate required for these administrative reforms, the State of Emergency has been declared and so far there have been serious structural reforms.
"Of course we acted within democratic principles and the state of law while we were doing all this," he said.
Expressing that life has returned to normal in many areas, Simsek stressed that there is no reason for concern for companies and individuals who are not involved in the financing of terrorism.
"I think the foundations of Turkey's democracy have become solid because when you look at the origins of problems in the recent past, you will find that this network of betrayal is involved.
"It would strengthen Turkey's democracy if this terrorist group were to be removed from the state and this period was closed in Turkey," he said.
"Turkey has returned to its original agenda, there is progress in structural reforms," Simsek said, expressing that the economic foundations are generally sound and have quickly returned to normal structural reform agendas."
Structural reforms are already essential because populism, conservation is increasing in the world.
"Turkey can only prepare for the future by reforming it," he said.
Lastly, he stressed that Turkey will not break up with the West. "Turkey may occasionally be in disagreement with our Western allies, with our friends, but Turkey does not part from the West, it does not give up the European Union," Simsek said.
He jumped 25 yards into the sea and...
In Antalya, the 17-year-old Shamil Tayyyar Flagçi was hospitalized when he jumped from the cliffs called Eagle Hill at 25 metres high.
Chamil Tayyar Flagçı, who swam with his friends on the coast of Cognaz in the evening, then jumped from the cliffs at 25 metres (25 m) above known as "The Eagle's Hill" under the variant.
Shamil Tayyar, a professional swimmer, was injured by the impact of the water.
The flagman, who had difficulty moving at sea, was taken ashore by his fellow professional swimmers, like himself.
Paramedics who came after the call took Shamil Tayyar Flagçı to Antalya Education and Research Hospital in the ambulance following the intervention.
It has been noted that there is no danger of the life of the flagman who has been treated.
A friend of Flagçi, who testified to the police, said, "His neck was hurt when he jumped off Eagle Hill."
He said, "We didn't see this coming."

Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will offer renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and London, but throughout the country.
I think it's going to make Heathrow quite attractive, as we did in London 2012, when we worked incredibly hard to benefit all nations and territories from the Games.
The Olympics have given Stratford and East End great advantages.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for locals and firms close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs, and we will not leave unemployed young people around the airport.
As before London 2012, there will be those who think the struggle to expand Heathrow is too difficult.
I was told that Britain would never prepare for the Games and that we would disgrace the whole world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they'll be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers all the questions asked.
As in the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
Expansion offers the opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs and 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving many skills and jobs around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We've got a great team at Heathrow that's put together an infrastructure investment of £11 billion in time and budget for two of the world's busiest runways, from T5 to the world's top airport terminal for five years in a row.
Now we're ready to present a third runway supported by a private investment worth £16 billion.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the United Kingdom, and I have no doubt Heathrow's expansion will be.
It's time we channel this Olympic spirit into Heathrow's expansion to secure our commercial future and create many skills and jobs that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton, chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Secretary of Commerce of the Treasury.
Adblock Plus is like a cat-mouse game on Facebook ad block.
For companies who make money from online advertising, it resembles a "cat-mouse" game, according to one of the companies that makes anti-data software software software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced it would block advertising blockers on its desktop website, Adblock Plus posted a blog saying its users could update their filters to block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the codes around advertising to make it difficult for advertisers to determine which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock now says he's decrypting new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "a forward fight between the community of blockers of open source advertising and those who are trying to prevent them has been going on since the moment the advertising was invented", and Facebook may soon be able to produce its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company is involved in this struggle shows how much concern advertising blockers have caused for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, about 200 million people globally use advertising blockers, which is four times the number of people who used this type of software in 2013.
Mobile ads with 1,03 billion days of active users that have access to Facebook with mobile devices now account for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
According to a spokesman, mobile advertising blockers are on Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and because they're not effective on Instagram, so the company is going after advertising blockers on the desktop.
Since Facebook considers such a move worthy of investment, desktop ads should still provide sufficient income.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced it will update the "promotional preferences" tool so people can better control the ads presented to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were alarming and would block some of the non-promotion content on the site.
"We don't give these people a good experience and we plan to deal with this problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail statement.
Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, so we're focused on creating tools like Ad preferences to give people control.
A woman ran into the Swiss highway; it looks like suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for people who witnessed a couple of cars hit her on the highway earlier Thursday in what looked like a suicide.
The incident occurred just after midnight Thursday in the Vaud Canton near Morgues in A1.
In a statement from the Vaud police, the woman lay "unhopeably" down in the night, and several vehicles hit her.
The 49-year-old Swedish woman, who apparently wanted to kill herself, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Police said several of the drivers involved were interviewed, but some were undetectable, and asked them and everyone involved to turn to them.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter explained to Le Tribune de Geneve that "a criminal prosecution has been launched as a logical step in such cases".
However, it is not yet known whether the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
That's what the prosecutor needs to find out."
Two similar cases over the past five years indicate that drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases, the paper ruled that it was normal for drivers not to expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, in August 2014, in A1, a police officer who crashed into a man lying on the road near Paynene was found not guilty of manslaughter due to negligence.
In court, the 22-year-old victim was drunk and passed out on the way.
The court said that the police officer who was responding to an emergency call was using the vehicle in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Anyone with information on this incident near Morges on Thursday should call the police from telephones 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once suitable for living
According to the forecast of the new NASA climate model, Venus once had conditions for life.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Studies have developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus was once home to conditions similar to the conditions on Earth, with its warm, waterless surface and atmosphere filled with CO2.
In the past, scientists explained Venus' low rotation rate with a thick layer of atmosphere.
But the newest estimates suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and that she could still return slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of the old Venus.
Although his planet has more dry regions than Earth, it may once have had enough water and geographical variation to protect against rapid evaporation.
The old Venus was also benefiting from a sun that was 30 percent dimer.
"In a simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus made sure that the day side was facing the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a news bulletin.
This caused heavy cloud layers of rain, which heated the surface and kept the surface warm like an umbrella from sun - source warming.
As a result, only a few degrees colder than the Earth is today, the average climate temperatures were emerging.
The model created a story similar to the evolution of planetary scientists previously proposed for Venus.
Although it once had the right conditions for life, Venus was exposed to a lot of heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.
Their ocean evaporated and the water vapor burned off by ultraviolet rays.
Hydrogen has run out, and all that remains is a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas effect, which is Venus as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Articles.
Patrick Roy resigned as Avalanche antennae.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as vice president of Colorado Avalanche coaching and hockey operations, saying the team had no say in the decision-making process.
The Colorado vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed this development and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations in Avalanche, Colorado, with energy, passion and determination," said Roy, 50.
Over the summer, I've been thinking about how I can make this team better by giving them the depth they need, and how I can get it to a higher level.
To accomplish that, the vision of coach and VP hockey operations has to be in perfect harmony with the vision of the foundation.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met in the present situation.
Sakic, who joined Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sakic said, "Patrick informed me of his decision today."
We thank him for everything he's done for our foundation, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league in his first season of 2013–14 with Avalanche.
The club scored 112 points and made the team finish first in the league, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the post-season games every two years.
At 2015–16, Avalanche passed the 39-39-4 target and scored less than five points for the second Joker field at the Western Conference.
Roy, goalie on the Honor List, won four Stanley Cups, two for Montreal Canadiens, both for Avalanche.
Oil workers from the North Sea continue talks by suspending strike
Due to the wages of oil workers in the North Sea, the strike was suspended, and the chief negotiators began to debate over a new round of talks.
The oil field service strike against Wood Group is run gradually on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"We, the Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions, have decided to restart the process to resolve the current dispute," a joint statement said.
In the next few weeks, from the beginning of next week, we will hold a series of meetings that will take all day to adopt a new view of problems.
Labour unions have said this protest has been their first action since 25 years, in case of wage cuts that could reach 30 per cent.
This year, Wood Group cut nearly 9% of payments to its contractors in the North Sea due to the negative pressures in the market.
In 2014, the company's contractors on the coast received a 10% reduction in price reduction.
The company said additional cuts would provide space for the company to pass through the difficult times in the market.
Shell laid off thousands of people in the process of organizing operations with the British energy company BG Group and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in the country by 10.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low crude oil prices, an economic situation in which Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish Parliamentary member Dave Anderson will meet with the labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor conflicts in the North Sea.
As he said, the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
"We need an effective economy for the majority, not the North Sea and across the country for minorities," he said in a statement.
Despite an average investment of about $7 billion over the past five years, new projects in the North Sea are expected to be invested less than $1.4 billion in 2016.
Kepler measured the rate of rotation of the stars in the Pleiades constellation
Kepler's space telescope helped astronomers create the most complete catalogue for the speeds of the return of stars in the Pleiades constellation with its final mission.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the constellation are spinning rapidly and why their rotations are related to planetary formation.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news bulletin, "We hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the history of the solar system when we compare our results with clusters of stars."
The Pleiades constellation is 445 light years from Earth.
Most of the stars in the constellation were formed 125 million years ago and are reaching a new level of adulthood.
They spin at the highest speed possible in their lifetime.
At the speeds of the uptick, these maturing stars form a huge amount of starwinds.
As these winds progress in the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a breaking effect on the stars.
As a star gets older, the rate of rotation begins to drop.
Kepler measures the speed of each star's rotation by observing the time between the appearance of noticeable starspots, such as sunspots.
The latest rotation speed catalog suggests that the larger stars are spinning faster than the smaller stars.
Rebull said that by comparing stars to dancers, the older ones make their turns on one foot slower than the smaller ones.
"In the country's ballet, we see that those who turn slower are much heavier, and those who turn faster are very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Pleiades are so close, it serves as the ideal cosmic laboratory to compare star characteristics with speeds of return.
"As young and old as the country's constellation, it provides theoretical models for star rotations in both directions," Rebull said.
There's a lot more we want to know about how, when, and why, so to speak, the speed of the stars' rotations dropped, why they left their dancing shoes in a corner.
Rebull and his colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the return speeds of the Ulker constellation in three recent articles in Astronomy Magazine.
