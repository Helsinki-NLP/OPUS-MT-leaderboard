Last minute: Cosmic Visitor Giant Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions, perhaps more giant asteroids in the Solar System that wander wildly and can cause serious consequences when hit.
These bodies, which can have closed or open orbits left over from the formation of the Sun, can sometimes pass through the Earth.
The 650-meter-wide asteroid 2014 JO25 is such a visitor, and it will pass by at 2:24 p.m. today, at a distance of 1.75 million km, the closest position to Earth.
As the day went by, we became more and more aware of this kind of news.
The most important reason for this is the advances in observation techniques and observational instruments.
This also allows us to identify smaller-sized asteroids that were previously undetectable.
For example, last January, an asteroid the size of a bus passed only half the distance of Earth and the Moon (250,000 km).
And even more interesting, the asteroid was only able to be determined a few days before the transition.
So there could be other cosmic buses coming at us right now.
Imagine what you would do if you heard that an asteroid 20 meters in diameter would fall right into the middle of your neighborhood.
In fact, asteroids of this size won't destroy your neighborhood, but probably the windows of all buildings will explode.
This will be due to the shock waves emitted from the asteroid that will detonate in the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that crashed into Russia in 2013 was of this size and was enough to smash the windows of buildings in several cities.
However, if you have a neighborhood on the target of an asteroid with a diameter of 100 meters, the advice is to go at least 50 km from your neighborhood.
Criteria such as the size of the asteroid and the angle of impact are the factors that determine the depth of the crater to be formed and the damage to the impact.
Let's take a look at a few scenarios according to a simulation of the European Space Agency.
If an asteroid with a diameter of 100 m hits Earth at an angle of 45 degrees at a speed of 60 km per second, a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and an diameter of 1200 meters will form.
Multiplication is equivalent to an earthquake of 6 magnitudes on the Richter scale, and even if you are 10 km from the impact point, a 3rd degree burn occurs in your body.
Others 50 km away will be waiting for shattered window windows.
If an asteroid hits a mile in diameter, the situation becomes even more depressing.
If such an asteroid hits Earth at the same angle and velocity, it forms a crater about 600 meters deep and 12 km in diameter.
So a whole neighborhood becomes a crater and disappears instantly.
Even if you are 100 km from the impact point due to the heat caused by the impact, a third degree burn occurs in your body.
Multiplication is equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 8 on the Richter scale.
The damage to the asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid but also on the rock structure of the region it will hit.
The above values are based on the scenario that occurs when a hard rock-like asteroid falls into an area of sedimentary rocks.
If the asteroid is mostly made up of iron, if it falls to a place with a surface formed by the cooling of lava, the crater size will increase by 3 times, and the resulting disaster will fold.
66 million years ago, something worse happened to the dinosaurs, and they were subjected to disaster caused by the impact of an asteroid about 10 km in diameter.
75 percent of sea and land creatures died instantly due to asteroid impact.
If such a large asteroid that destroys dinosaurs has targeted Earth, the most robust option would be to leave the planet.
Every day, tons of matter fall from space to Earth.
Most of these burn in the atmosphere.
Some asteroids, large enough, burn in the atmosphere, causing flares known as starshifts among the public.
Let's end our writing with another comforting story.
Studies show that for the next 300 to 400 years, an asteroid that is massive enough to cause very serious destruction is not expected to hit Earth.
I'm sure you're a little relieved as an average of 70 years of living creatures.
Flash claim for medel: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, whose black and white people's agenda to reinforce the Stoper area is seen as certain to leave Inter...
After playing for Chile in the Confederation Cup, the 30-year-old footballer, who took a vacation and recently re-worked with Inter, is waiting for offers to come to him.
One of the Italian's prestigious newspapers, Gazatta dello Sport, suggested Beşiktaş made a bid of 10m euros to Inter for Medel, who could serve in both the stopper and the front libero region.
The Black-Whites, who submitted their proposal to Medel, were said to have expected answers from both sides, while the Chilean footballer was welcomed to live with his family in Istanbul.
Despite Gazatta's claim, it is quite difficult for the Black Eagle, the FFP limitation, to pay as much as 10m euros for Medel.
There is a possibility that black-and-whites would first turn to Medel via rental, as in the Caner Erkin transfer, or add the star player to the cast if there is a serious reduction in its bonservi.
Beşiktaş Negredo reported his transfer to the stock exchange
Human rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning for people of color to travel to Missouri, due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The Missouri state NAACP Travel Advice Notice, effective August 28, 2017, recommends that African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourins pay special attention and be extremely cautious as they travel from the beginning to the end of the state as stated there, due to the recent occurrence of questionable, racially based events across the state."
NAACP said that a new Missouri law makes it difficult for people to win discrimination cases, while also making the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities, effective for the group in issuing this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin," said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP to Kansan City Star.
"We hear complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."
This is the first time the association has issued such a warning for a state in the United States.
The group exemplified racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the deaths of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Sanders was arrested by Missouri police for not being charged with a crime after running out of fuel as he passed through the state and died under suspicious circumstances.
The recommendation also highlights a new report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than white drivers.
"The advisory statement is for people to be awake and to warn their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be ready to bring bail money with them, let their relatives know that they are going through this state."
In Missouri, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, according to the latest figures in the FBI's hate crimes reporting program, placing the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law in which it is more difficult to sue a workplace for discrimination when renting a dwelling or giving a job.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration walkthrough laws ordering local enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations; ACLU says this would increase practices by race.
Travel warnings are often issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to this practice in response to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba in Beşiktaş
Demba Ba, who was transferred to Chinese team Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million euros two seasons ago and rented to Black-Whites during the half of last season, is returning to Beşiktaş for free.
Asked for a detailed health report from the Senegalese player last week, Black Eagle took action following a report from the star footballer.
The Black and White administration, which began work for the 32-year-old player, which the Chinese representative did not consider on the squad next season, knocked on the door of the Shanghai team.
Not listed
Demba Ba, who was not listed due to his foreign status in China, conveyed to the administration that he wanted to return to the Black-Whites.
The Chinese team approved the departure of the 32-year-old.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days and sign the official contract.
Castillo operated on in Trabzonspor
The statement on the Bordeaux club's website stated that Castillo underwent an arthroscopic meniscus operation from the left knee at Istanbul Liv Hospital, stating that "Our player after the operation by Prof. Dr. Uğur Haklar is expected to start training with the team in 4 weeks".
Castillo had been injured from his right back island in a prep match with Dutch team Heerenveen at the maroon-blue team's Slovakian camp.
The Colombian player, who was announced to be out of the field for 3-4 weeks due to his treatment, was also scheduled to undergo surgery due to the meniscus problem he had previously experienced.
A referendum exit from Barzan!
Barzani gave a speech at a memorial ceremony in Duhok, on the occasion of the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist organization DEASH's attack on the Yazidis in Sinjar district of Mosul.
Addressing the independence referendum that the IKBY wanted to hold on September 25, Barzani said: "I have to say this regretfully, we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and proper country."
We tried all the ways with Iraq, but we were utterly helpless and desperate.
Past experience with Iraq has put us in this position, and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and be protected.
So we need to show the world that we can all determine our fate through a referendum in order to ensure co-existence and security.
I have to underline this as well; the referendum is not a goal for us, but it is a means for us to achieve the greater goal.
After the fall of the Ba'ath Regime in 2003, Barzani recalled that the Iraqi central government made many promises to the Kurds, not long after the disaster in Sinjar occurred, saying that a direct referendum was decided after the fight against Daesh.
Barzani expressed his desire to peacefully and democratically determine his fate for the protection and development of the IKBY people, saying, "It turned out with documents that Iraq cannot or does not want to protect us like a state."
"He doesn't want us to move forward," he argued.
During the fight against the terrorist organization DAESH, the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons, but Barzani noted that the Hashdi Shabi, which was soon established with a fatwa, was immediately legalized and all weapons were supplied:
Peshmerga within Iraq's defence system, no interlocutor was taken.
The central government did not do to Peshmerge what it offered to Hashdi Shabi.
Peshmerga is considered part of Iraq's defence system under the constitution.
However, while Hashi Shabi had no presence in the constitution, the laws were broken and all the means were mobilised.
We're not saying we're against Hashi Shabi.
Peshmerga and Hashi Shabi fought on the same front, so why, on the one hand, is Hashi Shabi legalized, while Peshmerga's existence and fight against terrorism is being covered up.
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On August 3, 2014, the terrorist organization DEAŞ attacked the Yazidis living in Sinjar district of Mosul, killing many people, including women and children.
Returned from disaster with 10 minutes
According to the BBC, the Boeing 777 passenger plane belonging to Air France airlines was west of Hokkaido in northern Japan while North Korea's missile was in the air.
Officials noted that the missile crashed into the area where the plane was located 10 minutes ago, adding that the missile was estimated to have approached the plane as close as 100-150 kilometers.
Air France said the missile did not intersect with the aircraft's route and there were no problems with the flight in question.
"The information we have at this stage indicates that the missile crashed into the sea more than 100 kilometers away from the aircraft's course," the statement said.
Isn't anything sacred?
Trump's White House now targets Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is that they start attacking statues.
Americans know as much of this as any; just as the carefully staged Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003 in Firdos Square in Baghdad.
Stephen Miller, one of the key theorists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what the president and CNN's Jim Acosta were doing in a heated debate over their bid to severely restrict legal immigration while symbolically destroying the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, he'd be lynched by a bunch of boat tours owners and Liberty impersonators.
But he attacked his meaning, and especially the meaning attributed to him after Emma Lazarus' famous poem was added to the memorial base 17 years after the monument itself was completed in 1903.
Miller was on his way to Acosta: "I don't want to talk history here from start to finish, but the Statue of Liberty...is the absurd symbol of American freedom to the world.
The poem you mentioned was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is actually right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This is about the contemporary reverberation of Lazarus' eerie words, in which not only does a state seem to invite some elderly immigrants, but also the poor: "Weary, poor, / crowded masses yearn for the breath of freedom, / the distraught undesired of crowded land."
There has never been a time when the "poor unwanted" was so visible on our screens.
Miller was not a literary critic; he explained that these people were not welcome in Trump's United States.
The conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it's actually a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus and his friends, who had campaigned to put his words on the base of the statue after his death, knew very well that they had taken quite a political action.
The statue intended to celebrate the connections between French and American republicanism by representing them in a stereotypical metaphor, with the arrival of Liberty into the body in the form of women.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in his poem, the female figure was no longer abstract, he had a voice.
And he gives himself a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The poetry's marriage to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American anti-immigrantism.
And just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers had long wanted to change it back.
Rush Limbaugh, a Baptist John-styler for Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Freedom did not invite anyone in, but rather was an early-time neocon who kept American fire in the dark world: "Mrs. Freedom stands out.
He exists to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to illuminate the path to the United States."
In a rather unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was all about perception.
Lazarus' magnificent creative act was to see it as being seen by the exhausted, distraught but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often terrible journeys.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who were looking for shelter and wanted to improve their lives.
His statue responded to them with words of hope and warm reception that they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump would find justified in any way.
Their torch is not to guide, but to incite hatred, their only source of power.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle only remembers when two Scots were able to join the Great Britain team.
Neil Black, the UK Athletics performance director, says the 16-man Scottish group on the World Championship squad will make a "huge contribution to the team".
The record-breaking Scottish athlete was selected for London 2017, which began on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland, and that UK athletics should learn from it.
"We're adopting it and we're trying to understand it and we're going to try until we get out of it," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish Athletics thinks it's about what they're doing.
British athletics: He thinks it's about what they're doing.
So is the man in the corner street.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely wonderful."
Laura Muir and many Scottish athletes, including Andrew Butchart, who would compete against Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 m, compete for the medal, while Eilidh Doyle was selected as captain by the squad.
"Eilidh is a bit of a humbler.
The captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"Whether they're Scottish or wherever they live or train, a few athletes have come out of that room very proud and really motivated.
The passion and true feeling that Eilidh naturally added was magnificent."
The silver medalist from the Commonwealth, who will compete in 400 m hurdles at his fifth World Championships, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scotsmen are on the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes in the previous world championships was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Last year, five British and two European record-breaking mid-distance runners Muir led.
It will participate in 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another Scotsman to watch Chris O'Hare, who had a very good season, running at 1500 m, including the British Team trials and victories at the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first championship, when Lee McConnell was the only other Scotsman on the team.
The team captain says he is "very proud" that many of his fellow countrymen will not only enter the team but in some cases will compete for the medal and struggle to stay in the finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that it was with votes given by other members of the team, so it was already a great honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me," he added.
"Frankly, I'm proud of all the Scots that came on the team.
This shows how far we've come.
And they're here, as proven athletes, as athletes looking out for the podium.
As for the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we were very lucky in this situation, in this regard, we have a World Championship at home.
I mean, it's really just the effect of being able to take advantage of this in-field support and the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to get up there and fight, and there's going to be such a great atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for state office if you can't handle voters' criticism
The father of our country had some knowledge of being negative in the press.
Americans liked George Washington, but it didn't take long before newspapers began to heavily criticize him for everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was annoyed by the criticism.
But he did not silence those who criticized him.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be abolished, and we can be dragged into the slaughter stupidly and quietly."
This brings me to Larry Hogan, governor of Maryland, who has to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff did not care about the case on the grounds that it was not serious, and the online comments were filled with "who cares?" reactions.
A lot of people said, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
This is especially important when you have someone like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor who is surprisingly popular in a state that is overwhelmingly Democratic.
It has the second highest rate of approval among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary nutcracker.
He excelled in leading his state and in strict adherence to principles.
He was also quite adept at using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his constituents, with his playful introduction of his hairless head after chemotherapy.
So it is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people from coming to the governor's page, which is a public forum, formally characterised and managed by members of the public's tax dollars paid staff.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than editing them.
But it's very easy to use images of trolls or spammers or haters making online verbal attacks.
The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people who only talk to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner, and a pastor; not a troll.
They all said that their comments were not respectful, thoughtful, and abusive.
In his sharing, the priest addressed Hogan's Catholic faith, quoting the Bible.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie was not full of hate, but asked about hate crimes.
He wrote to the comment section of The Post's news, "I have made a polite comment that I am disappointed that he is unresponsive to hate crimes and other recent news."
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same subject, it's more to be ignored by some as a collective effort than by a large group of concerned citizens."
Others would probably call it "idea advocacy," which the governor's staff calls a "intensive spam attack."
The Facebook era makes it easier for a message to be easily appropriated through the blocking of an opponent or the deletion of a negative message.
It is much cleaner than the old days when staff were sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical writing, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But, digitally, that's exactly what's happening.
Hogan is not the first public post to be criticized for disabling Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked in the Twitter feed.
One of the decisions that could be referenced in the future on this topic came from Virginia last week.
The chairmanship of Loudoun's Administrative District Supervisors Board was in violation of the First Amendment when it banned an electorate on Facebook, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was also visited by ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the reasonably priced postal era had a very similar effect to that of the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and unnamed letter writers eroded his leadership.
Even then, Washington had unnamed trolls.
People who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to the newspapers that brought Washington's decisions underfoot.
According to the online George Washington Articles Project, which collected historical documents, petitions criticizing his stance on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of expression, dissent, and debate are at the very heart of our nation.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes he will be at the Renaissance Club in the comfort of his home
Ronan Rafferty, a former number in Europe, hopes that in the next three days, the Renaissance Club in South Lothian will be in the comfort of his home while hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Northern Irish, leading the next door before losing to Paul Eales on Archerfield Links, feels a commitment to the new venue and acts as the tournament's ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, "I have watched the Renaissance Club being built and we see that it has achieved its glory with this organization."
Players will see the field in its best form, in a state of remarkable condition.
Jerry did a remarkable job of setting up this place.
He is an unbeatable defender of this game and proud of his success here.
This is a great show for the field."
Although British Eales has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour, he will struggle to maintain a championship for the first time in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special," Southport-based player said.
"I never had a chance to protect the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the calendar the year after I won.
It's nice to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Memories come alive from last year, and it was very special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a time when we were truly special and always cherished."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour at the age of 50 at the beginning of this year, is also returning to the game in his field.
This event will be the first Scottish competition since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you fight inside," Helensburgh man Orr said.
"You want to do well, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played real golf.
I'm happy to go so far."
Those who participated in this trio in the field were former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field; others include Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.
Attendance is free and parking is available; a car with one person is charged $5 per vehicle and a car with two or more people is charged $10 per vehicle.

I found the answer
Imagine a "seat"... Budget with 6 billion 867 million Turkish Liras, more than the budget allocated to each of the eleven ministries, including Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism Ministries!
The number of staff is 117,378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the Presidency of Religious Affairs!
Yes, I'm going to talk about Mehmet Görmaz, the head of Religious Affairs!
For days, I've been looking for answers to the question in my head...
I wonder the real reason Mehmet Görmaz was taken from his seat...
I read every article that came out about his posting.
None.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
Just earlier this year...
Mehmet Görmaz prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DIB).
A $1 million S 600 Mercedes was pulled under by President Erdoğan.
So he had no problem with Erdoğan.
So what happened?
You might say, "Seven years in office, isn't that enough?"
The first DIB President, M. Rifat Börekçi, served 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz, who you all know, sat in that seat for 11 years.
So... the president's tenure is open.
Again, I ask: Why did Mehmet Görmaz leave his seat?
It's on the job...
Shia proximity
The source close to power said: - "According to the traditional ulema, the Mehmet Dönmez people did not have the circumcision!"
The code for this sentence is: he didn't own the Sunni!
The person who uttered this phrase bounced behind him: "It was found modernist by the traditional ulema!"
So, Mehmet Görmaz was seen as innovative.
What do you mean, innovation?
The answer to the question was hidden on a trip abroad by Mehmet Görmaz.
Date: December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Görmaz went to Iran to attend the 29th Wahdet Conference, which will be held in Tehran - aimed at bringing Islamic denominations closer.
He met with Iran's religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khameney.
He prayed with the Shia clergy in their ranks.
And he said at the conference: "The sects are human schools formed over time, representing different ideas and convictions in the understanding of the religion of Islam".
The purpose of all of them is to determine the direction to God.
Each of them is on a roadway leading to the main road, but their destination is the same.
It is never acceptable to equate the sect with religion or to view the sect's membership above that of Islam.
Separatization, marginalization and conflict based on sect are reflections of taboo and ignorance.
It was the religion itself that was most damaged when sects presided over religion...
I would like to emphasize again by highlighting here:
The Shi'ites and Sunnis are one nation...
"No one can deny another because he perceives Islam as he understands it and does not live it"...
A year later...
Only Jafari leader Selahattin from Turkey participated in the 30th Vahdet Meeting in Ozgurdüz.
I mean...
Not Sunni but Vehhabian
Mehmet Görmaz's trip to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of the "traditional uleman".
It was from this that no one attended the next Tehran conference, representing the Turkish State - again.
Besides, Mehmet Görmaz had received four invitations since taking office and had not been able to leave.
The reason was obvious; the Shia in the DIB - anti-Iranian "traditional ulema!"
Immediately after the Iranian trip, Mehmet Görmaz's seat began to wear down from the beginning of 2016.
At the beginning of this was Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş in charge of the DIB!
Mehmet Görmaz drowned so much that he wanted to "connect to the DIB Presidency".
At the core of it...
There was a difference in the state's view of Sunniism.
Some of the "traditional ulema", whose theoretical worlds were created in Saudi Arabia and Egyptian madrasas, identified Sunniism with Vehhabi-Salafism - in the shadow of the United States!
These were anti-Iranians who could not even tolerate a trip to Tehran.
Cubbeli Ahmet's remarks about Mehmet Görmez were not surprising: "No danger came to Dianet from this."
"O my Lord, let a righteous head of state be devoted to the land and to the people of the people."
"Ehlisunneti" were using it as a symbol concept of Iranian hostility.
At one time, FETÖ's anti-Iranism, backed by the CIA, was now running new names.
Moreover, with FETÖ conglomerates...
A photograph of a young man with a whiskey in his hand was served to the media with the lie "Son of Mehmet Görmaz"!
What a coincidence!
Who made Mehmet Görmaz the biggest opposition in the media: Turkey, the newspaper of the U.S.-led Community of Lightmen!
After all...
- Who resists bringing Sunniism to the Saudi Vehhabi-Salafist line...
- The one who didn't fuel the sect split...
- Modernist... a clergyman was destroyed by the "traditional ulema" whose consciousness was created during the Cold War...
U.S. cultural imperialism continues to Arabize Turkey rapidly (to make Vehhabi-Salafi).
Do not doubt that the President of the Future Religious Affairs will be the Vehabhi-Salafi representative!
"We support Turkey's protection of sovereignty"
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu went to China to pay an official visit.
Çavuşoğlu and Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi held a joint press conference at the State Guesthouse in Beijing, its capital.
"We hope that Turkey will participate more actively in international issues," Vang said.
China will support Turkey in its efforts to maintain sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that it will be resolved on the Palestinian issue with the international community, including Turkey," he said.
Regarding the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Çavuşoğlu said, "Turkey is seeking close cooperation with regional and international organisations, international organisations are complementary, not alternative to each other."
Spiritual officially begins his second term
Hasan Rouhani's presidency, which won the May presidential election in Iran, was approved by country leader Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
Hassan Rouhani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, was sworn in at a ceremony attended by Ayatollah Ali Hamaney, the country's religious leader.
Turkey's Ambassador to Tehran Reza Hakan Tekin participated in the ceremony, which was attended by senior military and political names as well as representatives of foreign countries.
Rouhani, who will serve as president for another four years, will officially take office on Saturday (August 5th) following an oath ceremony in parliament.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekçi, representing Turkey, is expected to attend the ceremony.
Security measures at the Cilvegözü Border Gate
From the Cilvegözü Border Gate in Reyhanlı district of Hatay, the passage of trucks carrying supplies other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine, cleaning materials will not be allowed.
According to the information received, the Babel Air Border Gate, located near the Turkish border, and the Cilvegözü Border Gate, due to adverse security conditions in its region, were closed to transplants other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning material.
The exits of the aid trucks from the Cilvegözü Border Gate are allowed.
No information was given as to how long the limitation in question would take.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Land
Bardina Degei does not use a stove while cooking.
He rarely even uses a container.
The housewife puts a sweet potato directly on fire, usually locally known as "nota", in her wooden house in the restless region of Papua, in Enarotali, in the regency of Paniai.
Half an hour later, the roasted lump is removed and wiped away with an appetite, hands unwashed.
Degei sits on the muddy floor where he does chores like washing laundry with blurry water from the nearby swamp, with no furniture.
A bucket in the roofless house acts as a field mound.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was never given a job in any field.
Polygamy is commonplace here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and most of them drink a lot, and there are soldiers.
"No one walks around the village after 5pm," he says.
A rare glimpse of daily life in the mountainous areas of Papua, a former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote by force before the troops invaded.
An existing movement propagating independence against Dutch rule quickly turned its anger towards the Jakarta government, which maintained its tight control over the region, banning foreign journalists or rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the area was officially separated into Papua and West Papua, where independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is uninhabited; the journey here includes a 90-minute flight from the regional capital Jayapura to Nabere and a 5-hour drive that shakes the stomach with a rental car.
No public transport.
The 19,000-seat resort contains wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with shriveled iron roofs converted by rust into various yellowish brown tones.
Let the journalists go, very few Indonesians have traveled here and almost no foreigners have traveled here.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago worshipped the Papuans, a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
Degei, in his vibrant, hand-touched yellow, dark shirt and shiny skirt, says, "We weren't used to wearing these clothes."
"We used to only wear leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia, with 28% of people living below the poverty line and the worst child death and literacy rates in Asia.
But at the same time, this is the golden land of Indonesia.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous area the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
Additionally, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
However, these riches, a source of misery for the Papuans, allow Indonesia's powerful army to maintain a suffocating presence.
The New York Times' 2005 study reports that Freeport paid about $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 for a single officer.
The Papuans' call for more autonomy threatens this golden spawning chicken and is mercilessly coming from their rights.
According to rights advocates, since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian army, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
Mass killings in the mountains of Papua in the 1970s reached genocide figures, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful demonstrators in the area last year alone.
The Brisbane Archdiocese's 2016 report "We Will Lose Everything" contains testimony of the atrocities committed the previous year, such as illegal executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electrocution are particularly popular), and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims because there are incidents every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
Pressures were increased as Papua's resources brought settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The region's 3.5 million inhabitants are 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim immigrants from the populated islands of Indonesia, Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi, come for economic purposes.
Javan warung kiosks sell gado-gado, served with peanut sauce mixed with fried chicken and vegetables.
Locals are struggling to compete.
"Immigrants sell chickens and vegetables cheaper in traditional markets than native Papuans," explains Paniai's native, 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to the regional capital Jayapura for work.
"This caused the native Papuans to lose the market of their Papuan mama-mama (women)."
Indonesian president Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, promised in the 2014 election campaign that he would solve inequalities and rights violations in Papua.
While the former carpenter was on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, he received the vote of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Panaia.
But very little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hope that justice will be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered his worst only two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas songs in front of a bonfire in Enarotali, while two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke through the darkness.
Scared children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers resented their style and later returned with four soldiers, according to local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Victims and eyewitnesses said that soldiers who had drunk alcohol chased the group and beat up their rifles with their bottoms.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children's group.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire, and the following day, events escalated.
About 1,000 Papuali men, women and children gathered to demand justice on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center.
They were carrying ceremonial hunting bows and danced the waita of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua (running in the form of a ring and mimicking bird singing).
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police and military garrison.
As the nerves were further strained, orders were sent to the soldiers via internal radio: "If the crowd shows resistance more than three times, shoot them to death." This is what an official document seen by TIME, which was not disclosed to local media, said.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the approaching danger and demanded calm by urging the crowd to return home.
No one had any intention of listening.
He told TIME on the porch of his wooden house, painted in bright colors, "I was shot in the left wrist when I turned around."
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot, but says the bullet came from the collected military erate.
"It was a crowd, shots were fired many times," he adds.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the attacks, the native Alfius Youw was shot three times.
Like many Indonesians, Yohanes, known only by one name, told TIME pessimistically, "I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it wasn't him."
"I saw him die...I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers had only "secured" the police station because the police station was under attack.
"When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves," said Pudjo Sulistio, Branch Manager, a Papuan police spokesman.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others were injured.
News of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an enthusiastic speech in Jayapura, stating that he shared the pain of the victims' families and promised to resolve the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately so it doesn't happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he had established a non-criminal mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some in the 90s and some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these violations, but we have processes to go through," he said.
Speaking to TIME on June 5, Wiranto backed down, saying there was no plan to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It will all be resolved by the law."
Wiranto, whom the B.M. accuses of "crimes against humanity" related to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's 1999 bloody independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Panai victims met such claims with bitter skepticism.
"I've been interviewed four times in the past three years, but there's been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the soldier, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus echoes the view that people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the soldier after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the soldier came looking for me," he says.
The attacks have not stopped yet.
On Tuesday, in the regency of Deiyai, Paniai's neighbor, Indonesian police fired at the villagers.
During the conflict between the villagers and the director of a construction company who refused to help take a man who was not himself to the hospital, one person was killed, and 17 others, including children, were injured.
24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's construction site office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded by firing a warning shot.
But locals say the moving brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives close to the hospital and witnessed the wounded being raised, tells TIME, "We were so panicked, we were afraid of revenge."
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the moving police brigade to withdraw from the area.
Paniai has always been a troubled region for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development fosters discontent with the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribal peoples, who live scattered throughout Papua's green mountain center.
Many joined the rebel army Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claimed to protect the rights of the Papuans by making random attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some senior OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and held arbitrarily by the soldier in recent years under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some are never seen again.
Among the Papuan peoples, Paniai is known as "a tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
Little bit of rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals to buy.
Bread is inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly note, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women who can maintain four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the harvest for the family, selling the rest in the local market.
The 10 notes only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupiahs (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have grown between indigenous Papuans and new immigrants who have come to Nabire Airport in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes.
Jobs that are already scarce often go to immigrants who are better educated and richer.
The Papuans rarely have capitals or necessary qualifications to run their own business competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Panai tribal council.
The isolation keeps the eyes of the world out of Papua.
Furthermore, the limitations of reporting for the international media remain firm.
Earlier this year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for "a lack of co-ordination with relevant institutions", despite the rare permission to film videos given to them.
According to Human Rights Watch Asia Deputy Director Phelim Kine, Jokowi's election campaign promises of removing newsmaking limitations and development were not met to increase transparency.
In a statement, he said: "There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to make news from Papua and West Papua, the restless eastern tip provinces of Indonesia: visa rejection and blacklisting."
The lack of press auditing means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to its neighbors, just near Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) encouraged the B.M. Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries historically support the OPM.
"The democratic system is still in effect in Indonesia and there is free media, so the evidence in human rights cases is hard to cover," Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, told reporters in Jakarta, not caring about the group's claims.
Locals want more foreign governments interested.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on 4 May, headed by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Baar, locals broke their silence, according to a source who attended the meeting and did not want his name to be announced.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack," Gobai, head of the tribal council, says.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai, apart from living under the impending threat of the bully soldier, are rolling around in sizable education and health care and scurvy.
Like other Papuans, Gobai says, the Paniai people see their own vote as a "borrow" to pay back to Jokowi.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai attack victims carried out one last symbolic act of resistance: burying a victim's body in the land directly across the street from the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, they will at least make sure that those responsible do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says, tilting his head forward.
"What else can we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's ' Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire in Dubai on Friday swept through the world's tallest residential towers, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 79-story 337-metre-long structure.
This is the second major fire in two years that has spread rapidly to the high building called the Torch tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no explanation was given as to the cause of the major fire.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to a fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get to the 50th floor," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said the fire brigade had extinguished the large fire at around 4 a.m. (0:00 GMT) local time and were cooling the building down.
The government has announced that they are trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This incident may raise questions about the safety of material used on the outside of high buildings around the world.
The investigation by the torch management following the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage was in the coating, i.e. the exterior panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the isolation and coating panel system on London's Grenfell Tower, where 80 people were killed, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire there.
'Social assistance' news for more than 4,000 chronic patients
4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit in the first phase from the social assistance program initiated by the Ministry of Family and Social Policies for poor citizens and their families who are struggling with chronic diseases.
The Ministry, which plans to provide monthly support to patients over two-thirds of the minimum wage through its assistance program, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information obtained, the details and implementation principles of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Fighting Chronic Diseases" which began work some time ago under the direction of Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, Minister of Family and Social Policies.
The social assistance program, initiated in cooperation with the Ministry of Health to support citizens who are struggling with chronic diseases and who are experiencing difficulties economically and psychologically, is also a first in the world in many ways.
Having completed all the preparations for the launch of the program, the Ministry will provide families with regular psychosocial support, not just cash, through its outreach program.
Thus, it is aimed that poor citizens and their families who have chronic disease and continue their treatment processes at home should not be left alone, both financially and spiritually.
According to studies, in the first phase, regular psychosocial and cash support will be provided to poor citizens who are struggling with Subakut Sclerozan Panencephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis disease and measles microbe, as part of a new social assistance program.
In the later stages of the program, poor citizens struggling with other rare and risky diseases will be covered by the aid program.
In addition to the support planned to be given at a rate of over two-thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments may be made to tuberculosis patients identified by the relevant health unit, who are unable to provide medical self-care, who are living on a bed-dependent basis, or who need to improve their home living conditions.
In order to benefit from the support, the monthly income per capita in the household is required to be less than two-thirds of the monthly net amount of the minimum wage.
In addition, citizens with SSPE must have a health board report based on the procedures and principles set out in the "Regulation on the Measure, Classification and Health Board Reports to be Given to the Disabled".
According to the survey, more than one in five U.S. passengers are bringing banned substances to the plane.
According to a survey of airline passengers, more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled banned substances into the plane from the U.S. Department of Transportation Security checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who unknowingly carried banned knives or other sharp objects.
Less than 1% later claimed to have accidentally traveled with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
Research conducted by a jet charter service called Stratos Jet Charters, with over 1,000 people, also found that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the participants who admitted to deliberately trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were members of Generation Y, while less than 15 were members of Generation X.
The most common substances deliberately smuggled from TSA agents are food and fluids.
More than 3 percent admitted to deliberately passing sharp instruments from security, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also admitted to knowingly carrying banned drugs on board the plane.
The firm said it had surveyed passengers across the country to find out how many people had accidentally brought contraband from airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
It's no surprise that the most likely people to smuggle goods from security, whether intentionally or unknowingly, are the ones who fly the most.
Still, as the firm notes, the TSA rules are a bit tricky and confusing.
People are often unsure of what fluids or how much of them they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of substance confiscated by the TSA has emerged as banned liquids.
For a while, people thought that the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international ones.
China welcomes U.S. statements
China's Foreign Minister Vang Yi said at a press conference in the capital city of Beijing that Tillerson was "not looking for an excuse to change regime, collapse of the regime, quickly reunify the peninsula and send our troops north of the 38th parallel".
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang expressed hope that Tillerson would re-emphasize the Washington administration's principles on the North Korean issue, and that the United States would apply these principles effectively and in a concrete outcome-oriented policy.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is their priority, Vang stressed that the sides expect them to find the middle way in which they can resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration has long insisted on denuclearization of the peninsula, maintaining peace and stability, resolving problems through dialogue and negotiation.
EPA President Pruitt Stops Delaying Obama Era Emission Reduction Laws
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Organization, withdrew the earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era laws, which reduced pollution-causing air pollutant emissions.
Pruitt represented change as his own organization was more sensitive to the needs of state environmental regulators than past administrations.
He never mentioned the legal objection to his previous position in a federal high court.
The issue is that states begin meeting October 1, which is the end of 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt had announced to his own organization that he would delay compliance by one year in June to give the plan more time to work and avoid "intervention of local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, Oklahoma's state attorney general, had long served as a trusted ally against tighter environmental regulations.
Since Pruitt arrived in Washington, Washington, he has acted repeatedly to block or delay regulations against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change is Pruitt's latest legal defeat for the agenda of undoing the arrangement.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA director's attempt to delay the practice, which demanded oil and gas firms, an Obama administration law, to inspect and reduce methane leaks, exceeded the limits of his own authority.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its return to ozone standards only strengthens the EPA's commitment to meet new standards with states on time and work through complex processes.
Pruitt, who has sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA often fails to meet the deadlines for decisions, waits to be sued by activist groups and others, and agrees to settle the dispute to set the timings for the decision."
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority it gives us."
Nevertheless, the EPA's statement said Pruitt could once again use "delay authority and all other legally available authority" at some point to ensure that the regulations are "supported by sound policies and the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone laws.
A parliamentary bill approved last month is struggling to delay the implementation of the 2015 laws by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate for voting.
New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "Following our cases, the EPA's decision-making is a significant achievement for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the stench flowing into their communities."
The case involved participation in New York City from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington and the District of Columbia.
When general pollutants are released by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical facilities, and other sources reacting to sunlight in the atmosphere, ground-level ozone is created.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in a quickly affected group of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applaud Pruitt's surprise decision-making.
Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity said: "It is disturbing that so much pressure is needed to get this discreet step from the person in charge of protecting the air we breathe."
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological struggle to flatter those who pollute the environment and the interest groups."
Inflation single digit
Turkey, which achieved the largest increase in exports in six years in July, drew unemployment, which was 13 percent in January, to 10.5 percent in April, and the economic confidence index also rose to 3.5 years, bringing inflation to a single household.
According to data released yesterday by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜIK), the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) rose 0.15% in July, while annual inflation fell to a single household for the first time since January, at 9.79 percent.
As of the main spending groups, in July, the highest monthly increase was seen in the restaurant and hotel group with 1.75 percent, while the group with the highest decline was clothing and footwear with 3.51%.
The highest annual increase was in the transport group with 15.24 percent.
Noting that inflation in July, in parallel with expectations, has declined to a single household, Business Investment Economist Muammer Koalcuoglu said, "In the moderate course of inflation, there is an impact of a decline in food and clothing groups prices."
However, the core indicators have risen compared to the previous month, as opposed to the headline.
"We do not expect a relaxation in the firm stance of the Central Bank," he said.
Despite the decline in the headline inflation, there was a rise in the core inflation indicators.
One of the special comprehensive TÜFE indicators that the Central Bank also closely monitors, the B index increased from 9.07 percent to 9.46 percent in July, while the C index increased from 9.20 percent to 9.60 percent.
"Inflation can fluctuate by December and fall into a single household in December," said Enver Erkan, Deputy Director of Research for Capital FX, who stated that inflation could be closed at 9.3 percent per year.
"As of the first months of 2018, opportunity may pass into the hands of the central bank," he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek: He will close the inflation year with one household.
The Central Bank's tightening will continue until inflation is below 7 percent.
We will give the reforms their final form on the nearby Food Committee.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci: We are delighted that inflation has dropped to a single digit, but this needs to become permanent.
In addition to reducing food price volatility in the fight against inflation, supply needs to be increased.
Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan: There may be some upward trend in annual inflation due to the base effect in the coming months, but the decline in inflation will become apparent from the first months of 2018.
We estimate that annual inflation will go further down.
I wish Fenerbahçe success in his next games.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said that their performance in the second half was not enough to skip the round in a 1-1 draw with Fenerbahçe in the UEFA Europa League 3rd qualifying round rematch.
Speaking at a press conference after the encounter, Foda stated that Fenerbahçe was a top team and said, "We couldn't use the wings in the first half."
In the second half, we balanced the game.
We had a chance for a second goal.
I'm still proud of my team.
In the second half, they changed the course of the game.
We could have been a little better.
Within the match, small things became decision-making.
"I wish Fenerbahçe success in his next games".
Foda stated that as long as they were in Turkey, they felt very good and were happy with the hospitality they saw.
Fernando İstanbul
Fernando Francisco Reges, a Brazilian footballer who started the Galatasaray Club transfer talks, came to Istanbul.
Brazilian football player who arrived at Atatürk Airport, fans enthusiastically welcomed him.
Fernando, where yellow-red fans showed affection with cheers, left the airport by boarding a private vehicle waiting for him under security measures.
Fernando, 30, who started his career in Brazil's Vila Nova team and played for Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City, is a midfielder.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after passing a health check.
Galatasaray, which continues its transfer efforts, has signed a deal with Manchester City for 5 million 250 thousand Euros for Fernando, which it has long sought to add to its staff.
Flash Raqqa move from the United States: Homeland Security Force...
Colonel Dillon, who connected with the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) with video conference management from Baghdad, said that the Raqqa Homeland Security Force (RIGG) trained by the coalition has begun to settle in areas cleared of DEASH in the city.
"The Raqqa Homeland Security Force, composed mostly of Arabs and anti-DAESH local volunteers in the cleared areas of the city, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from escaping or returning," Dillon said.
Dillon stated that 230 more people have completed their training this week and joined the group, saying that "for the time being, the number of forces in question is 850".
Dillon said the coalition was training the group on basic weapons training, as well as on first aid, armed conflict, screening and checkpoint operations.
The interest in the Raqqa Homeland Security Force is very intense, Dillon said, noting that the coalition will continue to screen applicants for education and employment.
The US-led coalition is collaborating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which formed the main backbone of the PYD/PKK in the acquisition of Raqqa.
The PYD/PKK terrorist organization had appointed a PKK terrorist named Leyla Muhammad as co-chair of the Raqqa civil administration council.
It is also alleged that members of the PKK/PYD would be part of the military force in Raqqa in question.
Dillon also announced that the U.S.-led coalition had collected heavy weapons from the opposition group Shuheda Karyateyn (Shukh) at Al Tanif camp in southern Syria, where it cut its support last week.
"After meeting with their leader last week, Shuhuk brought back the heavy weapons and equipment the coalition had given them, but some small weapons and light vehicles were allowed to remain with them," Dillon said.
Last week, the United States announced that it had withdrawn its support from Shuhuk on the grounds that it had gone outside the non-conflict zones with Russia and patrolled and engaged in activities not related to the fight against Daesh.
It is stated that the group wants to fight against the regime of Daesh, as well as the regime of Bashar Assad.
According to leaked phone call notes, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
Notes of phone calls between US president Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders were leaked by the Washington Post.
In a phone call with Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27, Trump pressed him not to publicly say that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The U.S. president rebuked the Mexican president who publicly held the wall to the ball, and rumor has it, "You can't tell that to the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign on building a wall along the southern border of the United States and promised Mexico that he would make the project pay.
The notes of his first meeting with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, which revealed a heated dialogue, were also published.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the agreement on the United States taking refugees to Australia was "absurd", "rotten", and "stupid", and that the deal under Obama would make him look like a "fool" after he offered the United States a refugee resettlement ban.
Mr. Trump ended the conversation by telling Mr. Turnbull, "This was the most unpleasant conversation I've had all day."
Patient relatives break doctor's nose
Doctors and employees of Turkey's High Specialization Training and Research Hospital left short-term work yesterday morning in response to the beating of a doctor's friends by their relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the hospital main entrance, with the currency inscribed "No to violence in health" they carried, reacted to the incident.
The hospital's Clinical Chief of Pediatric Cardiology, Prof. Dr. Feyza Ayşenur Pac, "No to violence in health" sounds inadequate to me, even as a side slogan."
In health, there's no place for violence.
"If it goes this way, this people will soon be unable to find a health group to serve them," he said.
The action of the health workers was supported by Ankara Provincial Health Director Dr. Kamil Turkmen, Ankara First District Public Hospitals Secretary General Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, Turkey High Specialization Training and Research Hospital Chief Medical Officer Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and patients in the hospital garden.
Condemning the incident, Pac said:
Unfortunately, violence against health workers is increasing.
One example of this event was yesterday (the previous day) evening, when our cardiovascular surgeon was beaten by a patient relative.
In order for these events to end as soon as possible, we demand that the sensitivity of our people also increase, even though we take the measures we can as our state, ministry and governor.
I condemn the events of yesterday on behalf of my hospital and health workers.
Noting that society needs to be made aware of violence in health, Odabaş said, "Unfortunately, this has become a professional complication that we have experienced from time to time."
"We will take our own measures, but most importantly, our nation has its own health care worker," he said.
Stating that the judicial process regarding the incident had begun, Turkmen said, "Our laws on violence in health have come out sufficiently effectively."
The ranks of the state are implementing it.
He is currently working on safety work.
In the past, these have always been idle, but now there is a direct public case, and the state is assigning lawyers, following the case.
"There are also examples of severe penalties for this," he said.
Following the statements, the employees continued their work.
The incident allegedly occurred around 5:45 p.m. the previous day.
Relatives of the patient who died in intensive care attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Özbek, who worked in the Department of Cardiac and Vascular Surgery, who gave the news of his death.
Uzbek was suspended from the scene by doctors and assistants; police were called to the hospital.
While Uzbek's nose was broken in the incident, the attackers were detained.
One of the witnesses to the incident, a doctor, said:
When our friend went to his relatives to inform them of the condition of a patient who had lost his life, his relatives attacked our friend and two friends, holding us responsible for the situation.
Our friend's nose is broken, he's bleeding.
Then we took our friend inside the O.R. and hid him.
For 15 to 20 minutes, security set us up.
If the sick relatives had crossed that firewall, much worse things would have happened.
Heavy blow to Daesh in Gaziantep: 102 sacks...
According to the information obtained, as part of the investigation conducted by the Gaziantep Public Prosecutor's Office, 5,100 kilograms of ammonium nitrate were seized in 102 sacks used to make explosives as a result of the operation on a warehouse in Kayaönü Mahallesi which was determined to belong to the terrorist organization DEASH as a result of the intelligence work directed by the Directorate of Anti-Terror Branch of the Gaziantep Police Directorate.
In the operation in which 6 people were detained, the suspects' residence, workplaces, warehouses and superior searches also included 10 long-barreled guns, 35 magazines belonging to these weapons, 2,370 full cartridges, 3 pistols, 7 magazines belonging to this pistol, and 382 full cartridges, 2 digital hunting rifles and 1 checkbook, 39, 705 TL and 15,870 USD, totaled in the amount of 163 thousand different people.
The searches also included four books issued by the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization's publishing bodies, with a decision to collect them.
Six people who were detained were referred to the judicial authorities following their interrogation.
The suspects were arrested by the sentencing Magistrate of Peace, where they were dispatched.
YPG looting in Syria...
The U.S. intervened
According to local sources, the AA, YPG terrorists looted the homes of residents of the town of Tel Semin, in the northern countryside of Raqqa, where the United States entered military support on the grounds of fighting the terrorist organization DAESH.
The response of civilians whose homes were looted and confiscated turned into a conflict with the terrorist organization.
On top of that, U.S. forces in the area entered the town in armored vehicles.
"Cougar MRAP" type armored, personnel carrier vehicles and Husky type mine determination vehicles were found to form a buffer zone in the town.
The terrorist organization YPG does not allow civilians fleeing death to enter cities under its control in Raqqa, which has been put under fire as part of an anti-DAESH operation.
The local activist network, "Rakkah is being quietly slaughtered", announced yesterday that 121 civilians had died in the organization's artillery fire in July alone.
Let's not move the old world's fights to tomorrow
Delayed perception of domestic and world realities can lead to crises, not just plain people, but countries.
One of the reasons why the backward East, which we describe as "singiness," perceives world realities by being late, may be that the reflection of these facts on the geography of the East is blocked by certain focalities, or that they are announced in a way that is beyond reality.
Don Quixote and Oblomov have also been the subject of the literary world to perceive facts and change by delay or not at all.
Cervantes's "Don Quixote" is a tabloid that still thinks of himself as a knight in the return, when the bourgeoisie began to form.
Or Goncharov's "Oblomov" was a lazy heir who thought that when he ignored the facts, everything could go on as before.
The Chinese example, for example, was a country that was open to the world and dominated the seas until the end of the 15th century, when a conservative dynasty was shut down as a result of its accession to the throne.
This lasted until the execution of the captains of boats outside the Chinese territorial waters.
One foot, one eye and one ear are in the West, the other foot, the other eye and the other ear are in the East, while we Turks, starting from the Ottomans, have constantly experienced dilemmas about perceiving facts and change.
We have tried to carry yesterday to the present, to understand the present with concepts that fit the old conditions, to think of yesterday as tomorrow.
One part of us was able to act as quickly as the focus of thought in developed countries, in perceiving the realities of the homeland and the world, as well as change.
This has been a constant source of conflict, tensions.
The university with Medrese, the modern army with the gendarme, the confrontations of doubt with faith, led to a dualism of dramatic content.
Progressiveism is also obsolete, and it has not been accepted that new and forward stances in a period will become obsolete and fall behind at the end of certain periods.
The progressives of yesterday began to declare the new and advanced "Dangerous" and those who tried to interpret the dorm and world conditions in a manner consistent with the current reality.
The most important lesson was that in the Ottomans, those who perceived the realities of the country and the world by being late, dominated the thinking and state life, eventually the empire disintegrated, collapsed, and the people became poor.
The most important lesson that our Ottoman past transferred to the Republic was the fact that the rapid perception of world conjuncture and change was an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Since this lesson has been very well absorbed, we have been the model country of this geography that has managed to maintain its unity, integrity, stability in peace from World War I until today.
In order for us to survive the global change process that has been entered into in a different way, we need to leave the memorization behind and act in harmony with the facts.
In other words, no good will come to anyone from carrying the meaningless campsites and blood feuds that have caused our democracy to limp in the past to this day.
Moreover, in today's world, the smallest mistakes lead to huge and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography in this regard is the Middle East, which we are in.
Historic artifact operation in Mush

"For the peace and security of our people, our operations under the fight against crime and criminals will be continued with determination."
Wind of Turkey
The global giants, who have confidence in Turkey's future, have struggled to break in yesterday's wind plant tender.
A world record was set in the tender with the model set by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to ensure the transition to national energy by reducing foreign dependency.
The tender, which would bring down Turkey's energy costs, opened the way for $1 billion in investment and close to 4,000 jobs.
By the beginning of 2019, domestic production wind turbines will be included in the system.
Renewable resource areas (YEKA) opened by the Department of Energy and Natural Resources participated in the wind power plant licensing tender with 8 consortiums, including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants.
In the tender, financial tender envelopes were opened in an attempt to determine the five bidders who first gave the lowest bid.
Following the initial bid envelopes, the lowest bid was $4.19/kilovat hours.
The deficit depreciation range was set at 0.01 cents.
After the tender began, the joint venture groups, including Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas, decided not to participate in the deficit reduction.
Groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed in the open reduction.
Following the withdrawal of the consortium with Nordex, MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon were the last two.
MingYang-First Construction took 11 breaks.
The Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon Energy consortium never used a break.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak: A record day for Turkey.
The deficit reduction continued 30 laps.
The winner of the intense dispute between the two consortia was the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon joint venture group, which gave the lowest bid with $3.48 cents/ kilowatt hours.
The consortium bids $3.49 cents/kilovat hours in the tender, while the Undersecretary Alparslan withdrew the bid to 3.48 at the request of the tender commission headed by Bayraktar.
With the result in the two-hour YEKA tender, Turkey achieved a world record.
The bid was $3.48/cent per kilowatt hour, making it the lowest figure in the world in this area.
The previous record was held by Mexico at $3.84/cent per kilowatt hour.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak, who held a press conference following the conclusion of the tender, stated that the winning of the competition by the German company Siemens was an important message to the region and the world, saying, "When we look at Turkey and Germany in terms of 200 years of historical cooperation, I think this result will make a significant contribution to Turkey-Germany relations."
Our goals are big.
The result today has revealed how robust and confident the economy and the energy market are walking into the future.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I am very proud to announce with this tender that Turkey is at the forefront of the region and the world's most reliable investable countries.
"All of Turkey, in this picture, which we will be proud of as 80 million, is our President who has taken Turkey to this point, within his greatest contribution, 15 years of power and leadership," he said.
"One of the most important steps in this is the cost of buying $10.3/cent per kilowatt hour with a domestic contribution in the wind until yesterday, falling to $3.48/cent with a historic record."
I am proud of this, on behalf of my nation, on behalf of my country.
Minister Albayrak stated that they aim to commission the first domestic production panels in solar energy by the end of 2018, and said, "By the beginning of 2019, we will include our domestic production wind turbines in the system."
The turbines will be installed in five designated areas.
The winning company will serve a total installed power of 1,000 megawatts in each of these 5 regions, with a requirement to install a wind power of at least 50 megawatts.
The total investment by the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon group will be over $1 billion.
With the introduction of domestic wind power plants, a minimum of 3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity will be generated each year, and the annual electricity needs of about 1.1 million homes will be met by the wind.
An average of 1.5 million tons of CO2/year emissions reduction will also be achieved thanks to the wind facilities to be installed.
The company that won the competition will build a factory with over $100 million in investment.
An average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines will be produced at the plant, at a minimum of 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will conduct R&D work for a total of 10 years in at least three of the fields of wing, generator design, materials technologies and production techniques, software and innovative gearboxes.
A budget of $5 million is allocated each year for R&D work, while 50 technical staff, 80 percent of them domestic engineers, will work.
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project's license period is also 30 years.
Kazim Türker, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Türkerler Construction, who was in the consortium that won the tender, stated that domestic production would be around 64 per cent in the project, 35 per cent of the equipment would come from abroad, and said, "We plan to finance the equipment from foreign sources and the rest from domestic banks."
Türker stated that the tender reflects confidence in the Turkish economy.
Murtaza Ata, President of the Kalyon Holding Energy Group, said, "It was a tender that would reduce Turkey's dependence on the outside by a thousand megawatts."
"We are pleased with the outcome," he said.
Siemens Gamesa Turkey Senior Manager Hakan Yıldırım also stated that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years and said, "We will do our best to lower the cost of electricity units."
The domestic rate of wind turbines to be produced at the factory will be at least 65 percent.
Of the 8,000 industrial parts found in the wind turbine, 65 percent will be native (at least 5,200 parts).
At least 50 MW, a total of 1000 MW will be installed in each of the 5 regions.
3,750 job opportunities 10 years R&D requirement $5 million Money to be allocated annually for R&D activities
1,000MW Wind Plant 65% Domestic Rate 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines at least 2.3 MWe power.
Investment over $1 billion 400 MW/year wind turbine production capacity over $100 million factory investment.
Electricity generation that will meet the needs of about 1.1 million homes At least 3 billion kWh of electricity generation each year Average emissions reduction of 1.5 million tons of CO2/year.
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists revive Racist lynching event to call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury was passed through a group of spectators in rural Monroe Georgia and rattled towards the small Ford Bridge at Moore.
The car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, stepped forward to block a group of white men with guns before reaching the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a man in a middle-aged thin-striped suit, took a long breath from his cigar and looked in through the windshield carefully.
Inside, the occupants were startled by fear.
"We want that shit, Roger!" the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
As a young black man drifted from the front passenger seat, the screams pierced the darkness.
Fortunately, this terrifying scene on June 22nd is just a reenactment.
But when a noose was thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone from the audience breathed in quite realistically.
Since 2005, human rights advocates have been returning to the Ford bridge at Moore to revive the lynchings of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has been charged with the murders.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the reenactment, said: "Although we see them in our communities, and we know who they are, it is inconceivable that not one person has been arrested all these years."
"It's a stain on history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong human rights advocate.
For him, this reenactment is a call for dramatic action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
He said: "We want prosecution, we want results, we want wounds to be cuddled, we want compromise, but we have to get justice first."
"We can't have the wounds and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner puts a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Ford lynching at Moore on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding areas were suspected in lynchings.
But not one of them has ever been investigated.
Although the suspects remained fugitives for decades, human rights advocates say the twin motivations of lynchings are always well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a high court ruling made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote in the primary at the end of that summer for the first time.
According to the FBI, at nearly the same time as the election, black partner Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in connection with a woman, apparently during a fight.
Brooks stated that the rumor in the town was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not from her own husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a leading white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcom out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousins went to prison with Mae Murray, accompanied by George Dorsey.
But when they arrived at the Ford Bridge in Moore as they drove away from the prison, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes, "It seems that Harrison was the one who arranged and ordered the murders."
"There was also obviously a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement that not only involved in the murder, it destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of eyewitnesses."
Brooks described it shorter and more succinctly.
He said: "It was a right-of-voting massacre."
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'This is what will happen to you if you register and vote.'
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led a reenactment of the Ford Bridge lynchings at Moore, which take place annually.
His performance reveals all the details, it's remarkable, and it's based on a deep kind of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to turn your gaze around, but Greene says that's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about lynching because it confronts all of us with the ugliness within us."
"But if you're not listening to me or listening to what's happening to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
Rehearsals of this year's production began in June, and on the first day, close to 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) packed into a room, and when Greene willingly entered the game's well-rehearsed general lines, they listened.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
Over the years, he has played the role of President Klansman, but he says the role never gets easier.
Marbaugh said, "I feel dirty because it's not me."
"But I think it's very important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room, were rehearsing their lines.
The game begins when Malcom yells at Hester, who is furious that he is sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
I said, "Z...i, get off my property!"
Rascona is reacting.
There's a hit.
And then everyone (at least black actors) is laughing.
Greene laughs the most.
Rascona asked, "What?"
He was alarmed, surprised.
Was I too tough?
Greene said "No" in the giggles.
"I just don't think white people were saying z at the time."
One of the black actors threw a jest-mixed stone saying "Yes."
"You have to suppress 'R'."
So the energy in the room is changing, and some kind of intimacy is replacing the unrest.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not only for the sake of the game, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The stage begins again.
This time he says the word that starts with Rascona N, sharp and accentuated.
No one is laughing at all.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, gunfire, and then silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black stands on the bodies of actors and reads Billie Holiday's sad eulogy "The Strange Meyva".
His voice breaks in one of both words.
On average, a group of four dozen spectators, a hundred yards back, wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The viewer is almost equally divided, black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the performance, many ahead of the road.
While Brooks took them on a sacred journey to the cemeteries of the Malcoms and Dorseys, they all endured Georgia's oppressive humidity for almost eight hours.
Up to this point, the killings had remained an anecdote, but standing in the same place where the lincin was now meant to be cursed.
As the song's final notes weaken, Greene invites the crowd to zoom in and examine the bodies.
The children squat on their hands, scorch fake blood and immobile bodies, and whisper to each other.
A little boy mutters, as if reminding himself, "They didn't actually die."
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
Actors throw the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh in a suit playing President Klansman.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow actors, and tears come out of his eyes in their arms, with the emotional cost of performance finally coming to him.
A woman whispers, "It's okay."
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did it for a reason."
The audience then sits down to dinner with the actors.
At a table, the white couple from Atlanta are in a heated conversation about a reenactment with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski has a hard time finding words about how performance makes her feel.
He said, "To hear these horrible, terrible words and those behaviors...they come out of people who look like you and they do it because they look like you."
"What this does to me is make me think that the lynchings are still going on," he added, adding, "these are now just called police shootings."
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks becomes the center of attention as she eats at her desk and recounts her memories of human rights.
He said he's already planning next year's performance.
He said, "Revival is kind of inspiring because it describes what we've endured, but it's also instructive."
"It's like if you don't learn from it, it might happen again.
Those who do not investigate their own pasts, those who do not know their own pasts, are doomed to repeat it."

AK Party to Congress-specific website
By AK Party, 6.
The website "akcongreler.com" was established for the usual Congressional process.
The website included brochures, materials and visuals that the party agency would use in the process.
In the site's 'Communication strategy' section, the rules to be followed during the congress process were listed in 14 headings.
President and AK Party President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose message was posted on the website, warned members of the organization to comply with the party's corporate identity during the congressional process.
"Now we are starting a new era of breakthroughs," Erdogan said in his message.
We must be renewed and renewed in order to achieve the 2023 goals with more robust steps.
"We must continue to work hand-in-hand, shoulder-to-shoulder, as we did yesterday," he said.
Pearson lays off 3,000 more to revitalize business, cuts dividends
While the British education group Pearson began another restructuring program to overcome the pressures facing the business, it said it would lay off 3,000 jobs on Friday and cut its margin by 72 percent.
The layoffs, mostly coming in late 2018 and early 2019, will add to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring, chief executive John Fallon said.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to save another 300 million pounds (US$394 million) by trying to get the job back on its feet, quickly sliding to digital learning with a third cost reduction program.
The firm, which agreed to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that there was no change in perspective this year after reporting its basic sales in the first half at a 1 percent increase of .05 billion pounds.
Text 2 led to death again!
According to the first report of the Forensic Medical Association, Hakan's death was suicide, according to the initial findings in the preliminary autopsy report.
In the detailed examination, no traces of darts and algebra were found on the child's body.
The reason for the suicide is that the elastic bandage he wrapped around his neck is inhaled as a result of being squeezed.
It was also determined that the gland, which his parents described as bandages, was the elastic bandage used in the wounds.
After the preparation of the detailed report on the child's death, it was learned that the report, which stated that the incident was a suicide, would be sent to the Büyükçekmece Public Prosecutor's Office, which conducted the investigation.
Police are investigating the boy's suicide in all its details, while investigations into his computer, which were confiscated after the incident, are ongoing.
Police said Hakan's friends would also file a statement.
It is also stated that information from the computer of Hakan, whom his relatives called "Cleaned" could be accessed by third parties or a gang.
Police are assessing that a gang may have driven Hakan to suicide.
Hakan's conviction of suicide turned his eyes to violent Text2.
Metin2, which has been reacting on the grounds that it has caused addiction and violence in children, was banned by the Governorship of Antalya for under 15 years last year, and came up again in 2009 with the murder of 13-year-old "minik hacker" Metin Kang.
In order to play Text2, which was designed in Korea in 2005, you need to log in and register as a member.
Players seek peace and justice in the world with the dragon god in the game.
In doing so, there are wars, the dose of violence is increasing.
The game features images of war with cutting, piercing weapons such as lines, swords, machete, axes, as well as images of humans being torn apart by wild animals and eaten by their flesh.
The player buys characters with money to gain strength.
The family, who buried their children the following day after the incident on 25 July in the house at the Esenyurt Istiklal Mahallesi Köknar Street, continued the murder claim.
"The whole dream was to be a doctor, we don't think he could hurt himself or anyone else because of the game," Baba Mehmet Ekinci said, adding: "They wrapped the elastic bandage around his neck and tied a knot on the side."
It was found that way, my son.
We certainly don't think our son can hurt himself or anyone else because of a game online, or commit suicide.
We knew he was playing a game like this.
It wasn't a game he played.
Let's say that when he got a little bored, he let it go.
Anne Gülizar Ekinci said, "There's no way in and out of the building."
My child is said to have entered the house at a certain time.
None of them match.
There was only one chair when his brother came home.
"But when his funeral was found, there were two chairs next to the computer," he said.
İlker KARAŞ: Could be gang-infected
Families generally do not pay attention to this issue.
They're looking at it like, "Let my kid be home and whatever's going on."
The child communicates with a lot of people through games.
There may have been a borrowing, lending situation, or blasphemy.
Or he invited a person in the game to come home, there may have been trouble between them.
He may have had an effect because of his problems with other people he contacted through the game and not directly from the game.
The game's visuality, editing, the child may have thought it was real.
The trauma that led to suicide could be related to blackmail.
If the child is in a condition of complaint to the family, there is also a situation of depression as he cannot solve the problem.
He couldn't have committed suicide because of the game itself.
There's also the possibility that the boy might be involved in the gang.
He may have been involved in the gang.
It can't be something that the individual child could have done alone.
Informatics systems consultant Fusun NEBIL: Parents should know their children's interaction
We can't say that games are harmful.
Research also says that games are beneficial for children's development.
What matters here is that parents pay attention to what their children play and how they talk to players online.
Parents should know and take precautions on how children are affected by what content.
There are only two children in the five years that are said to have died from the game in Turkey.
This shows that it is not only the effect of games that a child ends his or her life.
I wonder what pushed this kid into it.
We need to find out first.
We need to look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
Stock market returns in Istanbul by 8 months to 50 percent
The BIST 100 index continued its upward trend in July, when it began in December 2016, and moved its rise to the 8th month at the top.
Thus, for the first time since July 2007, the index rose 8 months in a row, while it gained 45.3 percent in this period.
The BIST 100 index, which has outperformed the world's major stock exchanges, including Germany, the United States, the UK, Japan, with its performance since the beginning of the year, did not leave the lead on a return basis in July.
The BIST 100 index, which peaked at 7.06 per cent in July, was followed by the Dow Jones index in the United States with a 2.54 per cent increase, followed by the FTSE 100 index in the UK with 0.81 per cent.
The Nikkei index in Japan, with the DAX index in Almaya, finished July with a loss of value.
As of the January-July period, the BIST 100 index was seen to perform highly from both the major world stock exchanges and the emerging country stock markets indexes.
This year, the BIST 100 index, which gained 37.6 percent of its value as of the 2016 close, followed by the Dow Jones index with an increase of 10.76 percent, the DAX index with a gain of 5.55 percent, the Nikkei index with an increase of 4.55%, and the FTSE 100 index with a 3.21 percent increase.
The MSCI EM index, which is indicative of emerging country stock exchanges, yielded a 23 percent return.
When looking at the historical process of the BIST 100 index, it was seen to perform similarly in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which last completed 8 months between December 2006 and July 2007, had also gained value in a row, increased by 38.3 percent during this period.
In addition, the BIST 100 index had completed 8 months between August 1996 and March 1997, with a successive 9 months between May 1997 and January 1998.
Meksa Investment Research Director Eren Can Ümüt told AA reporter that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for 8 months, noting that the rise has exceeded 37 percent since the beginning of the year.
Ümüt noted that the MSCI emerging markets (EM) index has risen 23 percent, with positive dissociation just when we look at these rates:
Fund flow to developing countries has been going on since the beginning of the year.
Funds, especially in search of higher returns, prefer countries that give higher interest.
In this case, domestic markets are affected in a positive way.
Of course, the appetite for risk-taking on a global scale is also quite high.
In this way, stock indices in risky asset status are in demand.
In the United States, the S&P 500 index has increased by nearly 11 percent since New Year's Eve, with new record levels being tested almost every week.
At the beginning of the year, Ümüt stressed that the U.S. Central Baka (Fed) has stressed 3 interest hikes, but has removed uncertainty by using the Fed's verbal guidance policy quite well, adding that there is an insensitive market for the Fed's interest hike.
The Ümüt stated that inflation in the United States is not yet at the desired level, but that expectations that the Fed will not act rashly on interest hikes and avoid radical moves are also quite effective at current pricing.
The U.S. President Donald Trump's inability to cancel health reform, known as "Obamacare", strengthens the perception that it cannot meet the promises of expansionary fiscal policies, the U.S. economy, which grew faster thanks to Trump, positively impacted stock markets for a period, but the failure of promises strengthens the Fed's hand in terms of faster growth and the response to faster inflation."
Ümüt pointed out that 2016 was a year of many negatives in terms of Turkish markets, saying that the BIST 100 index, which is negatively dissociated and oversold, is in an effort to close the gap relative to its counterparts.
Noting that they did not see a strong recovery with the domestic news stream, Ümüt noted that the current outlook could be interpreted as triggering an increased appetite to take risks abroad and a desire to close the gap relative to domestic markets.
The Ümüt stated that he had been tracking some profit sales in the BIST 100 index, which technically tested new records with 108,600 levels, and noted:
The 109,500-110,000 region in particular is a critical threshold in the short term.
After approaching these levels, it is normal for profit sales to take place.
In the short term, we think a new local or global story needs to be created for pricing over 110,000.
For now, passing 107,500 support downstream could trigger profit sales.
In this case, although we follow the 107,000 intermediate support, I think it can be seen to loosen up to the 106,000-105,500 zones.
In particular, breaking 105,500 support could lead to a retreat of up to 104,300, which corresponds to 50 percent of the rise from 100,000 to 108,600.
Stating that the decisions of both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) will be at the focal point of the global market, Ümüt said that expectations for the Fed are already clear, but that the prospect of a balance sheet reduction program in September FOMC is not expected, but the possibility of it coming into play could trigger strengthening in the US dollar.
The Ümüt stated that this could trigger profit sales in the emerging country's (GOU) stock indexes in the short term in the shadow of over-buying, adding, "What's important besides that is what the ECB is going to say."
After a July monetary policy board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said they would discuss the course of monetary policy in the fall, which allowed the euro/dollar parity to rise above 1,1700 levels.
Thus, statements that the 60 billion-euro monthly asset acquisition program will be reduced or terminated will mean that post-Fed liquidity on a global scale will also be reduced by the ECB.
"Therefore, negative pricing may arise on behalf of the country's markets, which give high current deficits such as Turkey and whose access to foreign funds is mandatory".
Erol Gürcan, director of Gedik Investment Investment Consultancy, also stated that there was a very serious rally in terms of global stock markets following Trump's election as president in the United States in November 2016.
Gürcan stated that it is possible to say that the main element that triggered this rally movement was Trump's commitments to tax reduction, as well as improving global growth expectations, and noted:
Borsa Istanbul was also one of the leading stock exchanges in the global rally.
While one of the main reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained highly discounted in recent years compared to similar emerging country markets, it is worth noting that the steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which has become active as of March, has had a serious impact on the rise so far in the index.
During the rest of the year, however, the positive developments were reflected in significant pricing and the KGF, which had a significant role in this rise, was also gradually satisfied, Gürcan said that although the BIST 100 index still remains discounted compared to similar country markets, the search for a new story for the rest of the year could also gradually come to the forefront.
Gürcan noted that developments such as the 180-day action plan, which has been expected to be shared in detail for some time, increasing the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, making arrangements in the direction of supporting company profits, possible tax reduction that has recently been raised, can contribute positively in this sense.
Gürcan emphasized that the fact that key developed country central banks such as the Fed, the ECB and the Bank of England (BoE) will also gradually tighten existing expansionary monetary policy stances is also among the critical risk factors for developing countries, stressing that "The possibility that the Fed, which has been pursuing measured interest increases for some time, will likely start its balance sheet reduction process after September", and that the possibility of the ECB ending its asset acquisition program in the near term was found to be significant.
In possible correction movements in the index in the coming period, the 104,150-104,600 support zone, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average with the uptrend seen since the beginning of the year, is highly critical, Gürcan said, adding that if this support zone breaks, the correction movement could continue to levels of 101,700, 100,000, 99,200, respectively.
Gürcan stated that if the current upward trend is maintained and the current historic peak level of 108,605 resistance breaks, the index could rise to between 110,000 and 112,000.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
Unconfirmed local sources say all three civilians were killed in the incident in the Karabakh area of the city.
The bombing was the latest act of violence in Afghanistan this month; more than 30 people died Tuesday in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement Thursday evening that an attack was carried out on a joint patrol mission with the Afghan military with 'personnel-guided hand-held explosives'.
The statement said all injured were in good condition and were under treatment at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram air base.
Reporters say the Taliban's growing strength and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh are a major concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed the death of at least 1662 civilians, with an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb in Kabul's predominantly Shia region killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack themselves.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people in the country's deadliest militant attack after US-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The act of violence underscores the unstable security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump puts his weight on whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the military and police in the country.
Reporters say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have led to a crisis in public confidence in the government, its policies, and especially in President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
EPA to stop delaying dirty weather rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Organization returned the day after an Obama era law, a decision to delay the law requiring states to block emissions that cause smog, when 15 states sued the organization over this initiative.
On Wednesday, the EPA announced its decision to continue with the "2015 Ozone Resolutions", saying the organisation showed its determination to work with the states late.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and being sensitive to them," EPA president Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's intention to delay ozone decisions by one year until October 2018; these decisions measure the current pollution of smog in various parts of the country, and decide where cuts are required to meet more challenging air quality standards.
Fifteen states, mostly Democrats, and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday that said the effort was illegal.
The President Donald Trump administration continues its quest to reclaim the wide range of environmental arrangements implemented by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump has called to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts led to the reaction of the Democrats and the protectionist groups concerned about the effects of more emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says that air inhalation containing ozone can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma."
The forest gave good news...
It's time for a stop and wing transfer!
Beşiktaş President Fikret Orman made statements to Bein Sports about Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and stopper transfer.
Fikret Orman said...
There is no surprise in the transfer.
Our goal is not too much transfer, it's a point shot.
Now we're going to make a stopper and a wing transfer.
We have Champions League games, so hopefully we'll draw a good draw.
We have to make a wing transfer.
10 million euros is easy, but we don't have that kind of budget.
If it comes to what we call budgets, we'll transfer, and if we don't, we won't die.
There's no way I can tell you about the lens until it's clear.
We are a public company.
The end of patience is peace.
Isn't the ISIS threat only for August 30th for the festival?
Reactions remain that the Ankara Governor's Office has banned all mass events, including sit-ins, a memorial meeting and so on, during August, on the grounds of the "ISIS threat".
While the governor's decision included the phrase "all mass events", it was the 7th in Ankara.
The International Grand Ankara Festival continues.
CHP Group Deputy Chairman and Ankara MP Levent Gök told SÖZCÜ that "August 30th cannot be affected by the bans" and said:
There's serious confusion.
Even the governor's office is hesitant as to which decision to implement...
The mission of the state is to create areas where the holidays will be celebrated.
CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir said, "All Ankara has a security problem, only Gökçek's organizations do not have a security problem."
Ankara Independent MP Aylin Nazlıaka moved the ban to Parliament.
"Doesn't this ban make clear the AKP's hostility to the republic and Atatürk? How do you intend to block the millions that will celebrate August 30 in the fields?" said Nazlıaka, who made the motion at the request of the Prime Minister.
"I learned from Edwina myself that I was cheated"
Demet Şener, who continued his divorce with Ibrahim Kutluay, was in Nişantaşı with his lawyer Aslı Hatemi the previous day.
Şener filed a spiritual compensation suit against Edwina Sponza, whom he claimed to have destroyed his home, who had presented together photographs of Sponza and Kutluay as evidence to the court.
The socialite beautiful Sponza also filed a criminal complaint against Şener, saying, "The bundle has illegally seized my private photos."
'I DON'T KNOW IF I'M YEMEN'
Following this latest development, Şener met with his lawyer at Nişantaşı Delicatessen and came out of the place when he saw the journalists.
Sener, who was very cheerful, laughed when Edwina Sponza's claim about the photos was reminded, saying, "God, I think I've got it in your house."
Aslı Hatemi also said of Sponza's complaint, "There is such a complaint, but its content is not correct."
"We have it all; we have brought it to court," he said.
Şener said that journalists "In recent times, everyone knew about your wife's relationship with Sponza."
He was greatly surprised by the question, "How did you not know?"
What?
How so?
"I swear I didn't know," said Sener, "Is it my husband who looked me in the eye, or was I going to believe the gossip of my eleletus?"
After reporters persistently asked, "Have you never heard of it?", Şener said, "I didn't hear it, of course I heard it the first time."
But I never believed in anything like that.
Everything was normal, in place; there was nothing to suspect.
Ma'am, when I sent it all to my hand, I learned it all, so it's new, so...
Responding to the question, "Was Sponza the one who sent the evidence?", Şener thoroughly confused the photographs and correspondence he presented to the court, claiming that Sponza himself had sent it to him.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay was assembly.
Besiktas to sign Negredo tomorrow
Beşiktaş Club will officially include Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo tomorrow.
The signing ceremony will be held at Vodafone Park for Negredo, where Beşiktaş agreed in principle on Spain's transfer with the Valencia Club.
The signing ceremony, which will be attended by club president Fikret Orman, will be held at 12:00.
Meanwhile, the Spanish football player will also undergo a medical check-up tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo thanks to Turkey in hours
Qatar's Economy and Trade Minister Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani expressed his gratitude to the people of Turkey.
Al Thani: "Thank you very much for your gracious attitude and your support for us."
I also send my brother President Recep Tayyip Erdogan the greetings of the Emir of Qatar.
Qatar's economy has proven its resistance.
In many countries, economies are negatively affected, while our economy remains intact.
We must work hard to ensure Qatar's independence and strength.
We have largely broken the embargo against us thanks to Turkey in hours.
We're not lacking anything at the moment.
Natural resources in us, natural gas exports are a major support to Qatar's economy.
Turkey has not been affected by the blockade against us, which has been ruthlessly conducted against us and against the law.
Today, Qatar continues to produce gas and LNG worldwide again.
"We did not experience a drop in our natural gas exports after what happened, but rather a 30 percent increase," he said.
"There was a volume of $554 million in the first quarter in the trade volume between us," Al Thani said, adding that work was ongoing in all areas with fraternal relations between Qatar and Turkey.
In this too, recent decisions have played an important role.
As a result of proving Turkish products in the Qatar market, it is very important for us to accelerate the entry of goods from Turkey in all sectors, to make investments in many areas.
"I thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us," he said.
The cost of recent disasters is $300 million.
TSB President Can Akin Çağlar stated that after the flood on July 18, insurance companies were reported for 7,000 damages of $116 million, 800 damages of $12 million were reported in the July 21 Gökova earthquake, and on July 27 there were reported damages of $168 million in floods and hails in Istanbul, adding that the cost of the last three incidents to insurance amounted to $300 million.
Çağlar said, "In terms of insurance, the damage caused by the full is around $3,500 per vehicle and the glass damage is about a thousand liras."
"In the earthquake, the average housing damage is $6,000," he said.
Stressing that they have worked hard as a sector to compensate for economic losses, Can Akın Çağlar stated that 3 out of 4 people do not have housing insurance, 1 in 2 businesses do not have fire insurance, and 2 out of 3 people do not have helmet insurance, saying: "The risk of natural disasters is increasing due to climate change."
Due to the low rate of insurance in our country, the risk of our citizens and institutions facing serious damage costs is growing every day.
All of these costs should not be left on the state.
Insurance policies are not as expensive as they are supposed to be, insurance is not only a sector that pays damages; it is also a risk management consultancy.
Increasing the rate of insurance awareness and insurance is very important for our people and for our country.
Can Akin Çağlar writes that "In the general terms of insurance insurance insurance insurance, the insurers must report their damages within 5 business days, and that time is over yesterday."
He answered the question, "Is there going to be an insurance victim?" "Although there is such a time in general terms, the statute of limitations in the Commercial Code is 2 years."
"Also, this is a natural disaster, so insurance people don't need to panic, no company says they don't pay," he said.
This is how the German media saw the giant tender!
During a period of increasing tensions between Turkey and Germany, it was noted that the German Siemens company won Turkey's first Wind Energy Renewable Energy Resource Areas (YEKA) tender.
German media announced this development as "German Siemens won the giant tender in Turkey".
DWelle Türkçe reported that the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon consortium won the YESA tender, saying, "The consortium will invest over $1 billion in wind facilities."
"The tender for the creation of a thousand megawatts of wind energy capacity has the feature of being Turkey's first YEKA tender," the report said, describing the number of companies competing in the tender today as down from 8 to 2, facing Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortiums, and the Chinese Mingyang consortium withdrawing from the tender as the 30th round began.
After the tender, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak made striking statements on Turkey-Germany relations.
The tender resulted in the German company Siemens winning, and we can say that this picture is an important message to the region and the world.
When we look at Turkey and Germany in terms of 200 years of historical cooperation, I think this result will make a significant contribution to Turkey-Germany relations.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I am very proud to announce with this tender that Turkey is at the forefront of the region and the world's most reliable investable countries.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible competition
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who would cross paths to showcase the most satisfying boxing match in the near future for 147 pounds, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, was in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until they walked down the aisle and greeted Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
On Showtime on Saturday, by unanimous vote, the former world champion in fourweights, Adrien Broner, was among the top five members of the list, both of whom were not consideredweight, following Garcia's defeat.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck with that."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday night at 7 p.m.
While posing for photos, Lomochenko's manager, Egis Klimar, noted that a potential competition between fighters would be "perfect size".
Garcia made the reminder, "I'm an old feather cock."
"I went high (to 140 pounds) for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down to the lightweight.
He must pass the lightweight (135 pounds), then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko attended.
"The shit needs this fight."
Klimas asked if this should be in 'pay and watch'; setting a date for the next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) and getting Lomachenko to fight in a 135-pound opening match this year is part of his strategy; Garcia is also interested in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell match for the lightweight title at the Forum on 23 September.
"The fight could be on 'pay and watch' because all the fans want it," Garcia said, and later stated that whichever channel offered the best financial package was open to him.
We're the real names.
No other name creates this degree of interest.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "magnificent fighter" and that he could participate in his Saturday encounter.
But Lomachenko hesitated to give Garcia a lot of credit for the pouch and said he thought the threeweight champions from Riverside looked "too slow," "sorry, Mikey ... you asked for the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was first showing the punch strength and then boxing.
Both said they felt that momentum had been created for their own encounters.
"This is a fight that needs to be fought.
Another fight doesn't generate that much attention and gossip.
Garcia said, "I'm very happy to deal with this."
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters and he's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight."
Russia to America Turkish resti
The White House is not considering imposing sanctions that would affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of those lines.
This is due to the increased cost of borrowing.
Concerned that Western investment partners would consider withdrawing from projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin in turn accelerated the construction of pipelines.
Allseas Group, the Swiss company that built the Turkish Stream line, which is planned to reach Turkey from under the Black Sea, accelerated construction at Gazprom's request.
Reuters also wrote that Gazprom had begun construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream "quickly" in order to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment test announced
The latest results of assessment tests of refugees subjected to a new medical age assessment in Sweden have ruled that more than 80 percent of those who took the test are over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration (Râttsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make age assessment more accurate in the asylum process after criticism of the failure of some refugees who claim to be underage by the Swedish Immigration Agency (Migrationsverket).
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test, and the Forensics and Drug Administration has now announced the results of a total of 2481 from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002 counts) were ruled to be 18 or over, while in 25 cases the Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration ruled that the subject was "probably 18 or over."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably under 18".
Tests were conducted only in cases where a person's age was questionable.
According to Johan Göransson of the Medical and Drug Administration, the results are consistent with past months.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The high rate of cases ruled to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees lie about their age.
In May, the agency announced the result of the 581 tests and said there were 442 cases where "the people surveyed were shown to be 18 years of age or older".
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the results of the 581 reported cases, it found that 243 cases had openly declared that they had turned 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which involves X-raying 20-year-old teeth and performing MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyze them, is criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, who assesses the biological maturity of people who also study whether the age of discovery is entered earlier or later than usual.
"I have reasons to think about it, and I don't think this should be the kind of measurement used.
It is highly doubtful to decide the biological age in this way.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend to be," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Medical and Drug Administration argued for the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you might say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is small.
The biggest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, in which case the risk is around 10 percent."
Star Hamidiye Mosque opens to worship today
The Star Hamidiye Mosque, built by Abdülhamit in 1885 to the architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened for worship today at Friday prayer following restoration work.
Regional Director Mürsel Sarı said restoration work, which began in June 2013, was completed and the mosque was ready for opening.
Yellow gave the following information: "The restoration work was conducted in 2 scopes."
The first part was the repair of the mosque, the main building.
The second part was environmental regulation.
In the first part, around 16 million liras were spent, and around 11 million liras were spent for environmental regulation.
First, the bullets of the wooden dome were opened, after they were renewed, the outer walls, the dirt of external factors, were cleared of rust.
Drainages have been made on the reinforcement.
There are very rich decorations as seen when we get inside the mosque.
It's a work with star motifs, and it's very rich in pencilwork.
There's a mixed style here.
"Selçuklu traces are also seen, considering that it was done in the Ottomans and 1885s, the baroque style has also become a factor in architecture."
U.S.ULHAMİT'S EME
"The chandelier found in the middle of the glass is German Emperor 2."
He had partial malfunctions, was re-cleaned and hung in his place.
It's a really valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages on either side of the mosque that are symmetrical, which we call salutary.
We know that these were made by Abdulhamit Khan, our great man who personally built the mosque.
So we have the knowledge that he made these with his own hands and was installed here.
They are still standing here in their original form.
Sarı said that President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is expected to attend the opening ceremony of the mosque.
Pantic claim in Göztepe
The Ukrainian press wrote that a 25-year-old Serbian football player who failed to make the squad in Dinoma Kiev could be hired for the club in yellow red.
Pantic, who started football in Serbia's Red Star team, played for Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic had signed Dinamo Kiev during last season's halftime.
West Virginia governor announces he will change party
West Virginia's Democratic governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening that he would change his party at a rally with President Trump.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have left me," Governor Justice said.
"I will tell you today with many prayers and thoughts...I will tell you today as West Virginians, I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor."
The rally drowned in cheers.
"So tomorrow I'll change my record to Republican," Justice added.
"If I were the technical director, I'd say it's time to start a different game for you."
Mr Trump had previously promised to make an important announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points and Democratic candidate Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes states that he owns coal mines in five states, with a coal business inherited from his father.
Its existence is about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Congress issued a statement Thursday evening saying that "Governor Justice's change of party was another blow to the Democratic Party, who would rather work to block it than make our country big again."
"With only 15 governors in history and the control of at least a few state legislatures, Governor Justice's announcement is only the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from the start and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC women spokesman Ronna McDaniel told CBS.
I'll do what's best for Turkey
Olympic third, Turkey record holder.
He was born in Cuba, but Turkey, where he came for F. Bahçe, was credited with his own homeland...
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore the national jersey...
He was first European champion, then Olympic third...
Now it is one of Turkey's most important medal prospects at the World Championships in Athletics.
Yasmani Capello, who competed in the 400 metre hurdles, spoke to SABAH before the championship starts today.
They didn't want you because they didn't like their degree in Cuba when they were young.
You've improved yourself by hiring a trainer.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
Some think you chose Turkey for the money.
What are you saying?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was my departure from the national team.
From that moment on, I would say I drew a line to what I was going through, what I was going through.
Then I came to Turkey at the invitation of Fenerbahçe club.
The initiative for the National Team was also thanks to Fenerbahçe.
They offered me an offer for reinforcements.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I had a lot of injuries in my youth, but after the opportunities offered to me in Turkey, I achieved significant success in Rio and Amsterdam.
I can't wait to do my best at the World Championships in Athletics and win a different title.
You've been crying at a press conference recently.
Can you tell us why?
Every time a question is raised about Turkey's ownership of me, I think of my childhood, my 23-year-old expulsion from the Cuban National Team.
And, of course, people's approach to me in Turkey.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt the same way when the Independence March was played.
I couldn't hold my tears.
I would like to thank Turkey for giving me the opportunity to fulfill my dreams.
I am very happy to belong to the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said earlier that you might have a Turkish lover.
You're with a Turk now, you went to Cuba together.
Do you want to share what you've been through?
The biggest plus of being with a Turk is calm...
Compared to Cuban women, peace...
Turkish girls are holding onto their relationship.
Your girlfriend is also your assistant coach.
You've been together all day, like getting involved in your diet?
He eats more sweets than I do.
(Both laugh) Actually, I don't have a very strict diet, but from time to time it mixes with what I eat.
My trainer Massimo Matrone also often gives harsh warnings with my diet, but I know it's for my own good.
How's your relationship with Turkish food, does your girlfriend cook for you?
Turkish women cook very well, but my boyfriend makes it more beautiful.
(Laughter) Dry bean-pilav is my first choice.
I JUST GLAUGHED TO HIM
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He had replaced other youths.
After winning medals for Turkey, we met in Cuba.
Looking at my face, he showed me to the young athletes next to him and said, "Look, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.
I'm blind to my limitations.
The curious subject of your glasses in racing...
I only use it for concentration.
As soon as I wear my glasses, I cut off my relationship with the world and build walls on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
When we say Tokyo 2020, what comes to mind first?
Felix Sanchez...
He won the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics when he was 35 years old in a 400m hurdle.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at 33, why not.
TURKCELL SUPPORTS
Turkcell Deputy General Manager Ismail All said they believe Yasmani Capello will succeed in London, "We strongly believe that Yasmani will best represent our flag in this championship as well."
We wish all of our athletes the best of luck to compete in London.
"We will continue our support for the further development of Turkish athletics and for greater success in our country," he said.
Coe praises 'same' apology Russia wishes for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the boss of global athletics, praised Russia's sincerely defined apology for the doping scandal, but stressed that the time was not right for the country to be reintroduced to the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship that his country was correct to be banned from sports and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized "for all the athletes whose gold and silver medals were taken by force in the competition".
Despite his assessments, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia in November 2015.
"I think today is a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased ... that the Russian Federation would accept it, that it had survived the very turbulent days, and that it would do everything possible to ensure the reorganization of the federation."
Coe said it was "pleasant" for Russia to accept its re-admission criteria.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think it's been moved on, but Congress supports the suggestion that the task force is not the right time to reinstate Russia's rights," Coe said.
"We have to do everything we can to normalize this situation over the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been to want to separate clean athletes from the flawed system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meeting strict IAAF criteria will be competing impartially at the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin Friday in London.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia has yet to meet many criteria for the reinstatement of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that the drug test was still inadequate and that banned coaches were still working freely.
U.S. denies 'tank to YPG' news
The U.S. Embassy in Ankara has announced that no tanks have been given to any side fighting in Syria.
The allegations that hundreds of trucks filled with tanks and weapons were sent to the YPG were denied.
A statement from the Embassy titled "Description on false media reports about trucks going to Syria" said:
In a series of untrue reports in the press over the past few days, it has been falsely claimed that the United States has sent hundreds of trucks to Syria full of tanks and weapons to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some of the basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The United States has not given tanks to any group fighting against Deasha in Syria.
Much of the U.S. military aid, primarily of light weapons and ammunition, supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
Syrian Arabs, including the SAK, are fighting to clear the Deaş from the area and regain their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: Foreign direct investment will be above last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said that 55 percent of all investment coming in last year came after July.
Ermut said that there was no reduction in investments due to the July 15 FETÖ coup attempt, but on the contrary there was an increase, "Maybe there would have been more increase, he made a bet."
Perhaps if these conditions did not occur, if there were no regional developments, we could see a greater increase in the multiplier effect.
Because of that, we have more hope for the coming year.
Hopefully it will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
As of the first 5 months already, we are going with an 11 percent increase compared to the first 5 months of last year.
But we don't think that's enough.
"We hope there will be more," he said.
"It's not that we're not concerned whether it's global or regional developments," Ermut said, stressing that they're trying to diversify investors.
Ermut recalled that normally by 2010, 75 percent of direct investments came from Europe, adding:
That figure fell to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share increased from 2 per cent to 7-8 per cent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do this, the Gulf countries had some problems among themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them; in particular, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are two key actors.
But the problem between these two countries saddens us and, as it turns out, allows investors to postpone their decisions a little bit longer.
Not only in terms of investments in Turkey, but we may be experiencing some delays because of this.
Arda Ermut recalled last week that there had been some incidents of Germany, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, reacted clearly and decisively to the situation.
When they spoke to the investors of the countries in which the most severe political crisis occurred, President Erdoğan said of the reaction, "Look, problems happen between governments, not between peoples at all."
Second, these people came and invested in my country.
These are no different for us than Turkish companies.
On the contrary, when they have the slightest problem, they will come to us, we will solve it.
"We will certainly not allow them to be victims". Ermut stated that they continue to support all investors with the comfort of this.
"We can guarantee that in the next period as well."
You will see that neither the German companies, nor the investors from countries where we have some political problems in any way, will have any problems.
On the contrary, I hope that we will do our best to increase the investment from these countries.
We think that the investments from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions about the investment climate.
"But at this point, we will do our part and do our best to ensure that our investors' perception of the investment environment is not affected."
TYDTA President Ermut said that after a one-generation one-way strategy, Turkey began to receive great attention from China, but they expected the biggest investment from the Gulf if the problems in the Gulf were resolved.
"In relations with Germany, there is not a single investor who says, 'We had trouble with these relationships, we had investments because of this incident, we are running away'," Ermut said, adding that there are companies that are coming, coming and following.
"Right now, close to 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies."
So almost 10 percent of the companies we meet from all over the world are German companies.
Some of these are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
The man is going to grow his investment, or he's got a subject, and we're going to be open as a project.
"So German companies are actually still a significant part of our daily workflow," he said.
Emphasizing that all state institutions should be careful at the time of perception operations to Turkey, Ermut said that the issue is sensitive and could be affected in the slightest bit of bad communication.
Ermut stated that what happened in the past 2-3 weeks was a good lesson, and explained:
The agenda of investors and politicians is always different.
We have always seen that economic relations always allow political developments to sort of get in the way.
Germany will remain an important trading partner and an important investor.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
The electoral agenda in Germany also unfortunately raises such rhetoric.
I think that once they're through, it's going to work out a little bit more.
In Saudi Arabia, the two countries are careful not to make a negative statement.
After all, an investor investing in Turkey is investing by targeting all surrounding country markets.
So not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of uncertainty in the region, there have been processes that have slowed down a bit.
But our talks with these investors are still ongoing.
My personal opinion is that investors are now holding off on a decision that they may be able to make faster.
We don't have a Saudi investor who says, 'In a negative sense, I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I'm getting out of here.'
On the contrary, we still have Saudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, who meet with us while they are on vacation here, and we follow all their processes.
Arda Ermut recalled that the international direct investments (UDY) that came to Turkey last year were $12.3 billion, saying, "I think we're definitely going to get past it this year.
"But how far we will go, these regional developments, will affect global uncertainties," he said.
While hoping that the impact would normally be greater, Ermut said that it may be a little more limited, pointing out that as of the first 5 months it was going to increase by 11 percent and that this could be preserved, "If there is no bad development, I believe that we will definitely close the year end better than last year."
Noting that a significant part of the investments withdrawn will continue to be real estate, Ermut informed that new investments in logistics, health, fintech, IT, petro-chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing could be seen.
Emphasizing that they will have new investments to announce in the coming months, Ermut said, "We may have an investment announcement in the near future in terms of manufacturing."
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a huge investment.
"There may also be investments from interesting countries". he commented.
Operation on 4 wine companies in 9 provinces: 55 detentions
İstanbul Anti-Smuggling Crimes Branch Directorate teams found that the foil coating covering the mushroom tap on top of the products sold by 4 wine companies was kept long and loose and the bandrols were not glued to the bottle, the TAPDK bandrols glued to the coating were collected after the products were sold and marketed by attaching to newly produced wines.
Olis teams have suggested that the state has lost 20 million 400 thousand liras in taxes due to repeated use of the suspects' bandrols.
Police teams conducted a simultaneous operation today at 55 addresses, including the factories and warehouses of 4 wine companies in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdağ, Bursa, Balıkesir, Manisa, Aydın, Denizli and Nevşehir.
A total of 55 people were detained in the operation, while searches included 15,000 ready-to-sale wines, 52 thousand 480 used TAPDK bandrolled hooded wine bottles, 12,890 TAPDK bandrolled hoods, 3 pistols and bullets, 100 boxes of sexually explicit pills, 992 illegal cigars, 698 bottles of fake liquor and 100 litres of anise.
55 people who were detained were brought to the Directorate of Anti-Smuggling Crimes in Vatan Street.
Suspects are in progress with security.
Their team's operation on factories, warehouses and businesses was reflected in police cameras.
Police crews were monitored in a warehouse to check out the hoods found on wine bottles ready for sale.
Bags of TAPDK bandroll hoods collected from used bottles have been recorded reviewing police teams.
How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar's departure to Paris?
The rules for preventing unrestricted spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring a world record from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any result can come from UEFA, the governing unit overseeing the European game, which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament, to Paris Saint-Germain.
Financial Fair Play rules issued by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to demonstrate that Neymar is financing his transfer without massive losses.
Barcelona was paid 222m euros (US$262m) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will rule a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some financial aspects of Neymar's trip to France include:
Given the team's money from the energy-rich Qatari family, PSG can of course pay Neymar to sign it and add it to the galaxy of other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on getting players, but they have to balance it with legitimate sources of income, provided they get to the top of their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that suffered major debts in pursuit of success were effectively scammed and at risk of bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the FFP began monitoring the losses rather than concentrating on the clubs' debts.
The change meant that the model Roman Abramovic first used at Chelsea in 2003 (buy a club with potential, spend high to improve the team, and create a global brand) would become a more difficult venture.
During the three-year FFP evaluation period, which continues until 2018, clubs can suffer 30m euros in losses.
Although Platini was discredited from the presidency in 2015, his successor in UEFA, Aleksander Cefer, is still determined to give up excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso, who led the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "The FFP is definitely not dead, and we will definitely strengthen it by moving the rules forward."
Although PSG will pay Neymar's purchase item in bulk, it may extend the amount to the contract term for accounting reasons.
Neymar signed a five-year deal so that the transfer fee can be shown as a cost of 44.4m euros in the annual accounts of the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw the implementation of the heaviest bids to Manchester City, owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined 60m euros ($82m at the time), which was later reduced to 20m euros, and was ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of 25 normally for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is wary of clubs that may attempt to deceive financial regulators by inflating its revenue through companies linked to the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company may sponsor PSG, UEFA will not allow it to be considered a justified income if the value of sponsorship is thought to exceed the standard market values.
This was the case in UEFA 2014, when the Qatar Tourism Authority ruled that PSG sponsorship was inflated.
It was reported that some of Neymar's earnings from PSG could come through the payments of Qatar's 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar would become World Cup ambassadors, and such a move could easily be uncovered by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions imposed on PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be even more careful against attempts to circumvent the rules.
UEFA is not in a preemptive meeting with the PSG regarding Neymar's transfer, the foundation said on Tuesday.
Since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG's situation, they spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
Recent accounts show that PSG made more than 10m euros in 2015-16 with a turnover of 542.4m euros.
Last fiscal year's accounts have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship deals, souvenirs and jersey sales.
The club expects turnover to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
Clearly disturbed by the departure of one of the football's biggest players, the Spanish league tried to block Neymar's departure from the PSG's alleged violation of the FFP.
"This is an open 'financial doping' case with its club and state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as the definitive owner of the PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who owns his own club, an American sports giant, shares concerns about La Liga being funded by a state.
Wenger said on Thursday, "This is a result of ownership and has completely changed the entire ground of football in the last 15 years."
"Anything is possible when a country has a club once.
It becomes very difficult to respect Financial Fair Play because for a country such a large player to represent a country can have different methods or different interests.
'Ball price' riot from insurers
According to TSB data, the insurance industry has been hurting in the traffic sector since 2006.
In 2015, the sector lost $2.35 billion, while in 2016 it made a profit of just $19 million.
Aksigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and Güneş Sigorta are traded in Borsa Istanbul.
Çağlar, who spoke at the meeting where the TSB's first six-month results for 2017, said that the 11-year loss in traffic insurance has reached $7.3 billion, with the ceiling premium implementation, they estimate the loss of the sector to be $2.3 billion this year, and the estimated damage-prim rate to 125 percent.
Çağlar also said that the 2015 figure will be caught this year, noting that the damage written in 2012 and 2015 also brings the profits of other branches, "This means that we are also raising the price of the citizen's housing policy by financing the bad driver."
"75 percent of the industry is foreign, and our partners abroad are in a sense financing the bad driver," he said.
The ages continued as follows:
We don't expect profit from traffic, but looking at the past 11 years, we can't show that we've made a profit for any year.
"We accept that, but we continue to hope that we can carry that damage in a reasonable environment, along with other policies," he said.
Çağlar said that there were dramatic price increases when the damage to traffic led to the profitability of other products, "In 2012 there were around 30 percent price increases in traffic insurance, in 2015 it nearly doubled, we wrote about the biggest loss of our history."
"Even in an environment where prices are so high, at the end of 2016 our profit in traffic was just $19 million," he said.
Çağlar said they expect the free tariff to be passed next year, "We will lower the price of the good driver on the free tariff and put a high price on the bad driver."
"But the Treasury is looking at the general course, the final word on when it will happen is in the Treasury," he said.
The Undersecretariat of the Treasury stated that the rise in compulsory traffic insurance premiums from 2015 had affected a large part of the community, adding that from April 12, the maximum premium (storage price) has been applied.
Accordingly, the maximum premiums for compulsory traffic insurance were determined on the basis of the provincial groups determined by considering each vehicle group, step and traffic density and accident statistics to be regulated.
On the other hand, as of July, the practice of "Risk Insurance Pool" was implemented for high-frequency steps or groups of vehicles in compulsory traffic insurance.
The premium and damage to the traffic insurance policies covered by the pool will be shared among the insurance companies.
The premium of these insurers will be determined by the Undersecretariat of the Treasury.
Çağlar said that in the first 6 months of 2017 in traffic with the implementation of ceiling premiums, premium production decreased by 11.5% compared to the same period of the previous year, while the number of policies increased by 4.9 percent to 8.6 million, with the reduction in traffic policies reaching about 30 percent, given inflation.
Çağlar said that traffic will again take away profits in other branches this year, "This ceiling is unsustainable at prices.
How much more can the sector carry this damage?"
Çağlar said that the capital of all companies in the sector is $9 billion, and that the capital of the sector will be finished in three years when only $2.3 billion is damaged by traffic, "Foreigners are looking at 'Why is good driver financing bad driver, why are my thousands of shareholders financing bad driver in Turkey?'"
"At this point, we're trying to tell the Treasury our problem," he said.
Following these developments, Çağlar asked whether foreigners came to the weight reduction point in the Turkish insurance sector, "They are not there yet."
They expect to invest more in Turkey because there are an average of 6 policies falling per capita in the Netherlands, while in Turkey this is 1.3.
"So Turkey is really a place to grow," he said, and continued:
So they haven't given up here.
However, even though the company gets a reasonable profit each year, it uses all the profits to keep the company growing.
According to TSB data, premium production in the sector in 2016 was TL 40.5 billion, while in the first half of this year it was TL 23.1 billion, an increase of 12 percent compared to the same period last year.
The ages said he estimated that the industry would not complete the year with 15 percent growth in total premium production.
Thousands of chronic patients receive benefits
The details and implementation principles of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Fighting Chronic Diseases", which began its work some time ago, were clear under the direction of Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, Minister of Family and Social Policies.
The outreach program for poor citizens and their families will benefit 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients in the first phase.
Patients will be given monthly support above two-thirds of the minimum wage, as well as regular psychosocial support.
The ministry will also make additional payments to tuberculosis patients identified by the relevant health unit, who are unable to provide for their medical self-care, live on a bed-dependent basis, or need to improve their home living conditions.
Payments will be made via Social Assistance Cards that will be provided through PTT.
Those who cannot go to withdraw money for reasons such as geographical conditions, illness, disability will be paid at the door.
In many ways, the program is also a first in the world.
One of the 10 companies to invest in is still German.
Arda Ermut, head of the Prime Minister's Investment Support and Promotion Agency for Turkey, said that German firms in Turkey are seen as Turkish firms, and that the political tension between the two countries is not reflected in the business world.
"In relations with Germany, there is not one investor who says, 'We are running away because of this situation.'
"About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies," Ermut said.
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"Germans make up a significant part of our daily workflow," he said.
Ermut also said that the partnership of Abraaj Group with logistics company Netlog is a good example.
Abraaj Group Partner Omar Syed pointed to economic growth in Turkey and said, "We have invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey."
Özer on his way to becoming the Last Ottoman
It was reported that the experienced footballer, whom the administration gave two weeks to find a club, signed an official contract with Ottomanspor in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, Özer Hurmacı signed a contract with the green-black club until 2019, 4 hours before the end of the transfer, while 29 leagues played in 2 cup matches, with a 5 goal 4 assist performance, making a significant contribution to the team.
The administration, which blocked its way back to Ozer, signed with Brazilian Sergio Antonio yesterday to replace this player.
The transfer of the century has taken place!
Barcelona announced that Neymar had been transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a price of 222 million euros.
Recently, the transfer development, which the football public has been excited about, has been made official.
PSG paid the Catalan team 222 million Euros, the player's release price, for the Brazilian player, to join the cast of the star name.
Neymar was the most expensive transfer in football history, along with the cost of this testimonial.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), one of the French 1st Football League (Ligue 1) teams, announced a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
Neymar, 25, who became the world's most expensive footballer, was awarded 222m euros for termination at the club's website, and signed a contract to play for PSG by June 30, 2022, the club said.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said he was very happy to play for the French representative, saying, "Since I started my football life in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most challenging and ambitious teams."
The reason I joined my teammates by coming to this club is to get as many trophies as our fans want."
PSG will pay Neymar 45m euros for each season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the representative of France over 400m euros.
Marine workers' strike ends with hike
İzmir Metropolitan Municipality's company İZDENİZ A.Ş. and Turkish-Business affiliated Turkish Marines Union (TDS) had no agreement on the increase clause in the collective contract.
Then the union member IZDENIZ workers had gone on strike on July 12.
The strike, which lasted for close to a month, ended as of 15:00 today after the workers were given a raise.
According to the collective contract signed, there will be a 12 percent increase in the salary of land personnel within İZDENİZ.
With the Income Tax exemption obtained after renewing its fleet, the rate of increase accepted for personnel with the status of a shipman whose salaries increased by 25 percent, along with the income tax exemption obtained after registration with the International Ship Registry, is 5.
The General Directorate of İZDENİZ announced that the flights in the inner bay would continue on the normal schedule, while the Yassicaada flights will start on Tuesday and Foça and Urla flights will start from the end of next week.
TDS President Hasan Pekdemir stated that they locked up transportation with their 23-day strike, saying: "Izmir people will relax."
As a result of the strike, improvements were made to the rights of our land and sea workers.
We are leaving the table with satisfaction.
On average, he will enter a share of 28 percent in his offshore pocket and 20 percent on land.
We also had friends who worked at the minimum wage level.
We have made serious improvements to their salaries as well.
Nostalgia Becomes Niche with "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
That is, for the characters' bright days in the '80s, for the grunge period in the '90s (when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter made sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for himself, for 2001, before their star Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd continued with the bigger stuff, this version of the story was nostalgic for all of them.
As a cultural product, this is both the recruitment and the embodiment of our ever-memorial Facebook era.
But as a series, it's like it's running out of time.
The "First Day of the Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and this was not only because of its absurd humor (it contained a story about the origins of a talking box plant, performed by H. Jon Benjamin.)
Focusing on the main comedy (middle-aged actors playing underage horny kids) he made it impossible to recapture the past part of the joke.
Now the parody is more random, including the monologue about the '90s movie "Ten Years Later" where adults play adults with less emotional support and perverted follower like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At some point, the character confuses an Apple Powerbook, some single-row roller skates, and "a lot of other things from 1991."
Many of the original stories are the same.
The soft-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter) is now a writer, still unable to forget Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
There is also another wildly treacherous plan now being thwarted by George H. W. Bush (a very well-placed imitation by Michael Ian Black) involving Ronald Reagan (again, Mr. Showalter).
As usual, the best part of the series is the interlude.
It's especially nice to see young Mr. Rudd, who always has Matt Dillon's under-the-lip beard in "The Bachelors," whose Andy, the most popular kid in the old school, now seems like an old man.
There may be moments of random madness that power this series (e.g., a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series) until it reaches what I think is its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", which is the final scene where the friendly crew goes to see the premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon addresses a different form of nostalgia: "The Americans"' Cold War revivalism, the film "Bomb of the Blonde" and even "GLOW" with iconography against East, West wrestling.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy directed by Rhys Thomas appears to be the found TV: a 1980s Romanian police friends drama in which two Bucharest police officers struggle for the real, atheism and Marxist-Leninist path.
The lead roles are played by wolf Gregor and idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, the English dub of their dialogue by Channing Tatum (who is also the lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But that's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice visual comics (Americans watch football, cops spend time watching chess on TV)
The well-known voice-over artist cast, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny, is a good material for the "voice who knows" game.
But "Comrade Detective" is so dedicated to the fact that a clumsy propaganda drama is likened to reality (including a killer wearing a Reagan mask), he often plays exactly like him.
Six long episodes don't know how to go, and comedy isn't quick enough or frequent enough.
Gregor and Iosef were constantly visiting the American embassy, where there were two fat men who always ate a pile of hamburgers like a hungry wolf in their lobby, while the "Comrade Detective" could better carry out the propaganda satire if it was shortened to a narrower length.
His message to the imaginary communist watcher is that Western culture can transform food that will defeat anything in a series.
The Romanian creators of fiction were not wrong: we do so to our own recent past and even to theirs.
FETÖ's ancestor Kadiyanis
The British Government has seen through fifty years of experience that our family is loyal and altruistic.
The supreme authorities of the government have acknowledged that this family has since been sincerely committed to the British Government and has been in great service.
The British Government needs to be smart and careful about this sapling that it has planted with its own hands, to thoroughly investigate and examine everything, and to carefully decide.
In trying to understand FETÖ, the organization of the Hashashis as a starting point is discussed, but an important difference forgotten is that FETÖ is an organization that emerged in the imperialist era and acted with colonial motives.
In my opinion, the 'preliminary movement' that must be dealt with in this minval is the Kadiyanians.
In the British praise at the entrance, the person who describes himself as 'the sapling planted by the hands of the British Government' is Mirza Gulam Ahmet Kadiyani, founder of Kadiyanilik.
Gulâm Ahmed, born in Kadiyân, a small town in Punjab, India, reported that "On December 1, 1888, Allah ordered him to take allegiance from his supporters and form a separate congregation."
Gulam Ahmed went a little further and said in 1891, according to the revelations and inspirations he received, that Mary died of a natural death, like other prophets, and that God had sent her as the Messiah and the Messiah that Christians and Muslims were waiting for.
According to this, he is the same person that Muslims are waiting for, and this is Mirza Gulam Ahmed Kadiyani.
(Encyclopaedia of Islam, TDV)
Gulam Ahmed, who wrote books defending persecuted Muslims against Hindus and Christians in India, which were completely under British control after the 1857 Sipahi uprising, recalls the Gulam Ahmed portrait of Gülen, who was thought to have been founded entirely with holy-minded sages, but who defended Islam against Islam with the Presidency of the Anti-Communism Association in Erzurum, which later emerged from CIA support.
Just like Gülen, Gulam Ahmed's most beloved idea by the imperialists is that "jihad" is a struggle of the Muslim only with his own self, and that if you can freely live your religion, imperialism has no dimension to contend with.
In fact, if you remember, Gulen went one step further, praising even the attacks of the Crusaders, whose wounds are still open in our history, in a 'vasa' last year: "It is not too dangerous for the Crusader to invade your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
They don't get involved with your woman, your daughter.
They don't touch the temple, they don't touch the crusaders!
The idea that Mahdi and messiah were united in themselves, that his own community would be the savior of Islam, that the concept of jihad meant only fighting the self, as well as the similarity of theses with FETÖ aside, the way in which Kadiyanism spread has generally taken place in the field of education and civil society.
The total number of centers of the Kadiyanids in the world, which is said to have exceeded 2 million, is 1869, with the number of countries where the emergency aid organization "Humanity First" is officially registered as 23.
It also includes 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 printing presses belonging to Kadiyanians in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries, and about 16,000 mosques around the world.
Considering that the Nobel Prize-winning "first Muslim scientist" Prof. Abdisselam, Sir Zaferullah Khan, President of the United Nations Court of Justice, Mahershala Ali, the "first Muslim actor to receive an Oscar", is also Kadiyan, we can see the depth of the global powers' approval of the Kadiyanians more clearly.
Let's note that the ladies' meeting in England last week with 30,000 people was also polished as a body display.
One of his slogans is "Love everyone, don't hate anyone" and a brief look at their history is enough to understand that the Kadiyanis actually mean "love your invaders/colonialists".
It is possible to drive the starting point and motivations of structures such as Hülasa, FETÖ or Tahir-ul Kadri to the Kadiyanis, and all of these organizations are actually supported as a gateway to imperialism and as a means of expropriating societies in order to serve colonialism.
The "last wish" came out of the cargo.
Emily Pomeranz (50), who spent her last days in a hospital in Washington due to pancreatic cancer, expressed her longing for a coffee and chocolate-mixed milkshake (milk drink) of a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of the woman contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who had run the same restaurant for 47 years, put the drink on dry ice and also paid a fee of $123 ($435), sending it to the hospital with "quick delivery" cargo 600 kilometers away.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
Ahmet Kul Construction, which has carried out important projects such as Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park to date, put the projects of Dia Mare in Istanbul Mimaroba and Solse 7 in Bodrum Yalikavak for sale.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, whose architecture was developed by Çamoğlu Architecture, was developed to get the maximum benefit from the sea.
Located on an area of 11,000 square meters, Dia Mare has a total of 188 residences and 17 commercial units.
The project, whose rough structure is completely finished, will begin to be delivered to its new owners in March 2018.
Dia Mare has a large number of apartment types ranging from 2+1 to 5+1.
The company, which will be launching two more new construction sites in Mimaroba and Bitez this year, is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkapı in 2018.
It has transferred 753 million to its subsidiaries.
Barış Ydaş said that many programs were built outside in TRT, where 6,760 staff were employed, and herpes prices were paid.
In "TRT 2016", the CHP deputy again drew the nation's taxes to AKP companies.
"It's called a robbery," he said.
The source that TRT transferred to the production companies was revealed with data from the official documents.
The official response to the application made by CHP İstanbul MP Barış Yfriend under the Information Acquisition Law revealed how TRT's resources were spent.
In TRT, where 6,760 people work as staff, he said that although there are all kinds of technical opportunities, in 2016 full 753 million 500 thousand TL was transferred to the subsidiaries through programs built under the external production name.
The CHP deputy used the phrase, "That means the stakes."
Barış Ydaş, "The production companies of journalists and businessmen from the AKP are practically looting TRT."
"Millions are being paid for productions that have not been watched or withdrawn," he said.
Recalling that the money transferred to companies was collected from public taxes, Yfriend said, "The institution, which has 7,000 staff, has returned to AKP's barley."
"What programs did these companies sign that 7,000 people couldn't, and they took that money?" he responded.
Yfriend explained that TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 was $224,456,182, adding that when staff salaries and other expenses were taken into account, the advertising revenue remained on the camel as an ear.
Yfriend, "TRT, which has become the voice of the AKP, cannot receive advertising either because it is not being watched."
Feed journalists are receiving money from TRT, and are squealing on behalf of the AKP.
"And the people are pulling the load," he said.
"TRT gives staff an annual salary of 660 million TL; but gives all the work to foreign productions."
TRT, i.e. 753.5 trillion followers were drawn from the public pocket.
It's a downright disgrace.

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will not change soon after it reduces speculation that slow economic growth and accelerating inflation will be an increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue "slowly" due to the narrowing of family incomes as well as keeping interest rates steady themselves.
Decision makers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 votes to keep interest at 0.25%, thus seeking less member growth this month after slow economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank drew growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, warning that household incomes would continue to shrink, with inflation still expected to rise close to 3% in spring.
However, he signaled that interest increases are necessary to rein in the inflation fueled by Brexit over the next few years, and said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw some of the massive economic recovery package launched a year ago, following Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will end its Periodic Funding Plan, which offers cheap financing to banks, but expects it to offer s$15 billion more under the plan (a total of s$115 billion).
Minutes after the interest decision was made, the bank said: "In the central estimate of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GSYH) continues slowly in the short term as the contraction of domestic real incomes continues to be a burden on consumption."
Regarding the interest rates, he stressed that "a bit of contraction in monetary policy" may be necessary to alleviate inflation, and "a bit higher" than the market expected.
Markets still predict that the first increase will be in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase will be "step by step" and "limited".
Estimates in May suggest that the bank's projected reduced growth this year and next year is 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintains an estimate of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound lost value against the dollar and the euro following the news.
Pound fell 0.5% to US$1.31 and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change came after recent disappointing growth figures eased expectations of a rise in growth, with GDP at 0.2% in the three months prior to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth will likely remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but will begin to increase slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
While the bank says the contraction will get worse before it improves, the latest inflation report leaves little to rejoice with households hit by rising inflation and small pay increases.
The bank said its monetary policy could not "block" the shooting of revenues over the next few years, but expected the salaries to improve "significantly" towards the end of their three-year forecast.
The increase in demand for British goods as a result of the weak pound will support the economy by stabilizing some of its declining consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest was reduced to 0.25% last August following a shock EU referendum vote that led the pound upside down.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's latest interest decision, there was a demand for increased inflationary pressure on struggling households and a rising interest increase with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation declined from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected and would increase once again in the coming months.
The bank said that, according to their 2% goal, the overlay was "completely" about the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent declines in casualty rates, the mortgage market will once again become more competitive, with lenders demanding jobs and a positive closure of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those approaching the end of their current contract in re-mortgage, with many free options and low interest, becoming more popular than ever."
NHS to write controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
In the Supreme Court, following a struggle to finance the drug in the NHS, patients will be able to access 'transforming' HIV prevention treatment starting in September.
NHS UK has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk people, will be provided by health services to an estimated 10,000 people through a 3-year pre-trial trial.
The Supreme Court's decision last year agreed to finance the experiment following the Appellate Court's ratification, in which the NHS was said to have the power to pay for PrEP, despite claims that local authorities would finance it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS UK president Simon Stevens as a 'new and serious intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'turning point'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register the public, with more clinics participating in October being fully implemented across the UK by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of getting HIV before sex.
Trials showed that PrEP significantly reduced HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that a person has enough of the drugs in their body to prevent HIV infection from settling.
Such medications can be taken daily or up to two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and HIV-positive partners who cannot be treated successfully.
Clinics will identify appropriate participants who will consent to the experiment from men, women, transgender individuals and unknown individuals whose partners' HIV status is controlled by an anti-retroviral treatment.
Persons who live in the UK and are registered with a practitioner may also register for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will cost â10 million and the NHS UK has signed an agreement to provide the drugs this week in an international bidding bid.
The trial was designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, conducted, and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This new and serious intervention will contribute to the large-scale and increasing success efforts in the prevention of HIV.
This is another milestone in thirty years of development in overcoming one of humanity's major health problems.'
Deborah Gold, head of the National Aids Trust, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If targeted correctly in those in need and at risk, PrEP offers the possibility of transforming the HIV epidemic in the UK.
Beginning in September, people at high risk for HIV will arrive at a new and powerful vehicle in the UK that is truly privately controlled and not open to negotiation with a spouse, through this NHS-funded experiment, which will lead to the recovery of many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority should be to ensure that the experiment is presented quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV."
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow's public health minister, said: "We welcome the start of the PrEP experiment, and it has been delayed by months of delays and then by the government's standing-up.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our view of HIV inhibition and the end of transmission of this life-changing infection.
The experiment will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this experiment be presented as quickly as possible across the country to protect people exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.

Two secrets of death
Former Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Çilingiroğlu's daughter Ümit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51), born in Washington, fell from the 19th floor of a business center also used as a hotel in Istanbul Levent and died.
Melis Salihoğlu, 24, a student at Koç University, was also found dead in his home.
It has been suggested that Salihoglu hanged himself.
Two secret death-related investigations have been launched, which are considered suicides by police.
'DIRECTIVE HAS STATE'
The daughter of Turkey's first Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Çilingiroglu, who served in the government of Nihat Erim in 1971, Ümit Makbule Çilingiroglu, born in Washington in 1966, entered Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler on 1 August at 5 p.m.
An ambulance and police team were called to the scene after a Kuwaiti tourist who had settled in the room on the 19th floor and had seen the lifeless body of Çilingiroglu, who had not been heard from for a while.
The medical team determined that Lockingiroğlu, who fell from the 19th floor to the hard floor, had lost his life.
The mother, Mediha Çilingiroglu, who testified to the police, said, "She's been depressed lately."
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on 31 July.
I have a grandson who has leukemia from my other daughter.
"This was taking care of my grandson and was adversely affected by my grandson's illness," he said.
Çilingiroglu is expected to be buried in Ankara, whose funeral was taken to the Forensic Medical Institution.
It is being investigated whether the locksmith was thrown out by someone or committed suicide.
'CANINA KIYDI' RESPONSIBILITY
Another suspicious death in Istanbul occurred in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoğlu (24), a student at Koç University, was found dead in his home.
The young girl's father allegedly went to her daughter's home near the school, where she had no news and could not reach from her cell phone.
The father met his daughter's lifeless body at home.
Melis, much loved by her family, close circle and friends, was allegedly hanged herself in her home, putting her life to rest.
The death of Melis Salihoğlu stifled his family and relatives.
Following Melis, a friend posted on social media, "A shining sun was hitting us in the face."
Under our feet, we were in a good mood as the green grass ran after that little plastic ball with your best friend Jack and your sister Eyshan.
He shared the message, "What's needed now is to die."
Living the luxury life: the mezzanine floor and smart design tricks turned this small Earls Courts apartment into a spacious home.
Former banker Joanne Leigh, a passion for real estate renovations, went from a large house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014 to shrinking.
It's evidence of the new design that Joanne was convinced of without packing her bags on the first floor of a flamboyant Queen Anne-style comb.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-boyfriend in a much larger area in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
The apartment in Earl Court was shown to me and they had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
After the first sight, the 1000 ft square circle was renovated from top to bottom.
It was originally a one-room and complex planned property; you had to pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and a lot of light.
It was my condition," he says.
To this end, he hired Erfan Azadi of the Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to take advantage of the 12.5 ft ceiling and create not only a structure but also a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces in a row, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the issue.
"The steel skeleton is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to adjust the gaps so that they could pile up without the need to lean down on each other.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but steels would bend so high that they would be at the right height relative to the function at the top or bottom."
This arrangement brought in many additional dramas, allowing Erfan to get two full-length rooms above each other.
The old type copper light window, taken from Retrouvius for the hanging floor, looks at the magnificent living space below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver highlights, and old-fashioned Serge Mouille lighting all determine the style of the bill.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding space, space, and light.
Mirrors placed at both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
The mirrored ranger panel in the kitchen gives a window feel to another room.
Mirrored units in the foyer provide storage space for Joanne's entire cutlery and glassware.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more spectacular sense of space, is to be able to close the kitchen when it is not in use.
The pop-up kitchens are not new.
What's unique about this is that it's a liftable door in the garage style.
Erfan explains the steel-powered polished MDF door, "We used some engineering in it."
"He's got a balance weight, so when you push the door up, he really slips easily."
With the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne earned an additional 16 square feet, an extra bedroom, and an improved session plan.
"At the end of the day, the session space is what you're going to sell, or the value of your property is determined," Erfan says.
"In favor, a real estate agent will go in and do a calculation on the basis of the session area."
Here they were able to use quality material that gave the space its luxury appearance while increasing the ground space.
"Materials are objects you touch so they help you build an emotional bond at home," Erfan says.
"In the house, you don't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
These are important, but they don't shake the strings of your heart."
This proves that through good design and increased square meters, an apartment can transform from something standard to something quite spectacular.
Actually, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens bonservile Beşiktaş
At the end of the 1.5-month talks, he was transferred to Beşiktaş with Lens testimonial, which was initially considered for hire.
After talks intensified over the past week, Lens signed with the Black-and-white team for a fee of 5 million euros in testimonials.
The Dutch player, who had a five-year deal, learned that he would receive 2.2 million euros annually.
Beşiktaş is expected to make an official statement regarding the transfer of the Jeremain Lens.

The couple decided to break up after seven years.
Brothers fight over $500 million estate empire
Two brothers are at war for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, valued at more than $500 million, forty years after the dynasties established by Italian families.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in Toorak, three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who gave him to the Supreme Court on how to share properties and business assets.
Paul had wanted to get out of the family business since 2014, but there was fierce debate in the Supreme Court over the fragmentation.
With their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties, worth more than half a billion dollars, which have been stored since a shop they bought in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and raised it in a chain with 160 retail outlets.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in the property, and De Lutis' portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contractor sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Under an agreement with their deceased father, Colin (who is described by Paul as a "significant driving force and a dominant personality" in the De Lutis family) owns two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns one-third.
A court file says this means Colin has property worth $36 million and Paul has property worth $176 million.
For Paul, splitting the property and the cash turns out to be a contentious subject.
In his first affidavit to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The divisions proposed by Colin left him with the properties I have always called the best."
The first Supreme Court hearing was held last Friday after many failed mediations.
The brothers are also in a fight over who will control the current job; Paul claims that Colin left him out of the business.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing certain properties.
Colin, in a sworn statement at first, says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the top priority," he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of affidavits recorded by firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer, along with e-mails and top lawyers such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal advisers held by both sides, are on the rise in the case.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were an Italian immigrant family that operated grocery stores and deliries from the late 1950s, and had purchased a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They had pawned their property to buy Colin's Collingwood property, where the family opened their first jeans store.
Colin says that "in my senior years in high school, when Paul was a little boy (aged 10), he founded Westco there."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to leave their property amicably to their son.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court," he wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colin said that when he quit, Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "satisfied with the circumstances of their financial breakup."
According to a 2015 biography by Eddi McGuire, a television star's best friend, Colin tried not to attract attention, even though he was a former AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Just because Colin was in court with the brief message, he replied, "I can't say much."
"It has been very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and drag our family's name to the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court application that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I to fall into the current conflict," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful about the solution."
Friday that hope seems to be lost.
"Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new private pen plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If so, it's the first.
Politico reports that the new White House private pen will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports), hoping to keep the boss more stable.
Some minor information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House's new special officer, met with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a fundamental problem that President Donald Trump had planned to solve with regard to the White House: the passing of bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that information, whether on paper or with briefings, should flow through her, because the president could make better decisions when given good information.
Kelly's diagnosis makes a lot of sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by overseeing the media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and he's in the White House now, his TV-watching habit is still in good shape.
A former campaign adviser, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February, "If Aday Trump was upset that he wasn't fair in the media, it was efficiency-enhancing to show him that he had found a fair place in credible media outlets."
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time, "According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit in check was to ensure that personal media consumption included a steady stream of praise."
All right.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any given time is ludicrous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't, like Trump's tweets would be much more provocative without their intervention.
We'll probably never know anything about tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff were able to get him out of danger even a few times, then his efforts were valuable.
But no one could prevent Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House consisted of competing factions, that is, people who in any case tried to advance their own agendas with the materials they presented to Trump (which could be trusted or unreliable), and people who put forward their own worldviews.
Politico had reported in May, throughout this whole story, the tendency of advisers to strategically convey questionable information to the president.
An example described in detail by reporter Shane Goldmacher was:
"The current and former Trump officials say that Trump reacted fiercely from the press to negative clippings, especially leaks that had a bad impact, and that he was driven to find out where they originated.
This also happened at the end of February when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article from Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com accusing special pen assistant Katie Walsh of being the "source behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It didn't matter if Johnson was banned from Twitter permanently for harassment, or if he presented no concrete evidence, or if he had made false accusations in the past and returned from them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-private pen Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "tryed to install a system that handles and documents the documents that Trump received."
How did that work out?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will emerge as a more effective executive than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own impulsive state and his aides are still competing for influence.
These invariant factors will make Kelly's mission quite difficult.
Crypto FETÖ revealed the players with a special template
İzmir Public Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya completed his investigation into irregularities in the "military espionage investigation" and the leak of some information as part of the investigation into the secret witness codenamed "Sarmash" after the Chief of Staff of the Naval Command, the Chief of Staff, the Admiral Jihad Sagittarius, said he was a FETÖist."
In the review, it was emphasized that the Admiral Sagittarius helped the investigating office in deciphering members of the crypto-organisation in the Navy Command, as opposed to being a member of the organization, and played an active role in combating FETÖ.
The decision, which pointed out that Sagittarius had been tried to be pacified by giving command of the Naval Forces under the so-called martial law order in the coup attempt on 15 July, underlined that Sagittarius had fought effectively against FETÖ from the first day of the coup attempt.
The following statements were used in Karakaya's non-tracking decision: "It was understood that Yaycı was working on the detection of crypto Naval Command personnel thanks to the special template for the detection of FETÖ members belonging to the crypto-private services class and the special system created through the 209 sub-criteria with 64 basic criteria."
It has been concluded that an estimate based assessment of the Sagittarius, which is known to be an active anti-terrorist organization and has made a major contribution in this direction, is not possible to be appraised by our attorney general as a result of his struggle, as there is no evidence of a particular and stubborn effort being observed in the judicial investigations, other than the statement of the secret witness, which is mentioned in the afaki and not based on a basis.
The Admiral Bower had previously been charged with libel.
It was also revealed that FETÖists were behind this, and that the alleged crime was conspiracy.
Former Air Pilot Staff Colonel Hakan Dinç, who complained that Sagittarius had insulted him, only turned the complaint in the form of an information note into a document, the former Adana Incirlik 10.
Tanker Base Commander Air Pilot Brigadier Brigadier General Bekir Ercan Van, former Chief of General Staff Forensic Counsel Colonel Muharrem Köse, former Chief of General Staff Intelligence Lieutenant General Mustafa Özsoy, former Judge Major Erkan Network, former Marine Captain Necmettin Aksoy, former Judge Aksoy, and former Judge Akif Uskim Aksoy, who had been involved in the investigation committee, were the ex-constructigators.
It was revealed that some members of the organization, including the FETÖ fugitive Tuncay Opchin, were targeting Yaycı with their posts on social media before and after the coup attempt on July 15.
Travellers crossed the ditch, returned to 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the richest hosts in the West Midlands are back in a fight with ambitious travelers who cross the ditch dug by the council to reclaim the space outside their own mansions.
Travelers parked 20 of their trailers outside an area called the 'rich neighborhood', which was Solihull's well-placed street at the time.
They returned after being fired in May, bringing horses, babies and a load of wagons from the ditch the council had dug to cut off their raids.
The cleverly moving group found a gap in the defense, leaking their vehicle through a roadway through a section left unpaved.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council, saying it was 'useless in solving the problem'.
An unnamed resident said: "They arrived there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.
The council should be ashamed of their actions because they are useless in solving the problem.
The Travelers were there in May, they were sent away, and now they are back again.
More came last night, probably more will come today."
He added: 'The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this with long suspension decisions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street, and I'm not happy to keep paying my taxes when the council can't even stop it."
A local resident, who did not want to give his name, said: 'Like a joke, we saw the last group of travelers just leaving, and we were immediately devastated by a new group.
Their numbers had increased this time, and a horse was even seen grazing in the parking lot.'
A female spokesman from the Solihull Council said: 'We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on the Streetsbrook Street property, we are launching the legal procedures necessary to get them out of there as soon as possible.
To support our gathering of evidence, it is very important that as many residents of the area as possible call 101 to report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help bring out the picture of the situation so that the court will consider it when we present our case to the court."

Last day rush!
They flocked to fire stations
Thousands of vehicles had been damaged in Istanbul, along with last Thursday's storm and hail.
While many drivers received reports from the fire department to cover the damages by insurance companies, drivers who have not received reports so far have queued for the report.
Drivers, who have a helmet today and have not reported it, came to fire stations and requested a report because it was the last day of the notice period.
Today is the last day
Drivers first took pictures of their vehicles to firefighters to determine the damage to their vehicles.
Drivers whose vehicles were damaged were then reported to the officers.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, "I've got a record, I'm going to take a picture."
There was intensity when I arrived.
"There was damage to the front window," he said.
Driver Erbil Kılıç, "We came running."
We're in line.
We took the picture.
"Now we will wait for the report," he said.
The skyscrapers, which are a wall of land with the sea, do not breathe.
Parliament Member Nadir Ataman of the CHP warned of an earthquake related to giant structures rising on the beach, stating: "The expert report on the case clearly says that these structures will not withstand an earthquake of 6 magnitude."
The stakes, where the solid rock is 25 to 30 meters below, are not dug so deep, it says.
Istanbul Ataköy high-rise hotel and residences building a wall between sea and land on the beach left the district breathless.
Nadir Ataman, a councillor of Bakirköy Municipality of CHP, reacted to the giant shopping mall, hotel and residence projects, which rose one after the other in the district.
Noting that the structures on the beach cut off the wind, Ataman said, "From now on, 80 years ago, those who planned according to the wind had created the Atatürk Forest for Florya.
80 years later, they planted giant skyscrapers in the wind corridors and changed the climate, just as an understanding of urbanism had been reached.
He said, "There's no breathing in the province."
"The temperature is felt 10 degrees more because of skyscrapers," Ataman said, noting that buildings rising like walls on the coast of Ataköy.
These buildings need to be built according to the direction of the winds.
But our skyscrapers are rising above Istanbul's wind corridors.
The wind can't get into the county.
These structures disrupt the natural balance of life.
Ataman stated that these skyscrapers, which harm the environment and human health, also cut off the connection of the people of Bakırköy to the sea, and said that they would apply to the Council of Monuments on the subject and go to the judiciary.
Non-surgical treatment is possible in hair rotation.
In cases with phenol administration, up to 83 percent success is seen.
In this method, the diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue cavity is filled with an agent that kills the hair roots.
Another of the non-surgical hair rotation treatment techniques is the laser method.
With various lasers, the hair follicles and the surrounding tissue are burned by circular radiating rays, allowing the tissues to be stuck and closed during this combustion.
Thanks to these two non-surgical methods of hair-turning disease, patients are able to return to their social and work lives in a shorter time.
Dr. Mert Atak, who stated that excessive weight, sedentary living, long-term sitting, doing work, not following hygiene rules with dense hair and body hair, caused hair to turn, stated that there were symptoms of the disease, such as pain, infection, abscess and swelling in the tail insertion.
Italy toughens NGOs' approach to migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they do not follow the new rules affecting their operations.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new statute, it will be difficult to see them continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti told the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat operated by the German aid agency Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actively cooperating with human traffickers, in a way that would facilitate illegal immigration.
The charity, which had only been active for a year, declined to comment on the content of the detailed accusations against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"The saving of human life for us is and will be our top priority, so we're very sorry that we can't work in the search and rescue zone right now," the agency said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess the charges currently being made after we have gathered all the information and have been able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, Iuventa, since October.
The crew are suspected of having taken in a boat full of rubber boats and migrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and allowing smugglers to escape by boats for re-use.
According to the files of the prosecutor, whose contents were published by the Italian media, at least one such meeting took place at a distance of 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, allegedly.
The crew is under suspicion of disregarding the authority of the Italian coast guard, who has been overseeing rescue operations in the area due to humanitarian effort rather than any other purpose.
According to the charter, there was supposed to be an Italian police officer on the deck of boats like Iuventa, who clearly monitored their activities.
Of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations, only three have so far agreed to comply with the statute: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS, and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The last said on Tuesday that he considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because it would not cause any "serious changes or obstacles" to his own rescue operations.
Those who refuse to sign include the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy after last weeks of rescues is indicative of efforts to strengthen Libyan coast security and cooperation with local governors.
"In recent days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," he said.
This month, he announced plans with Libyan governors to conduct further talks on economic development initiatives and to take measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving Chad, Niger and Mali in hopes of reaching Europe.
Last-minute punch!
In Moscow, the capital of Russia, the "day of parachutist troops" was drunk vodka, which beat watermelon, as is the case every year.
He attacked Nikita Razvozjayev, a Russian NTV television reporter who participated in the event and broadcast live in Gorki Park, which over-extended alcohol.
Reporting the developments of the day on live television, the reporter warned the man, who appeared suddenly and blasphemed, "We're going to take over Ukraine." "Please shut up."
The drunk man, who was described as a former paratrooper, threw a hard punch at him on the reporter's warning.
The reporter, stunned by the punch hit he took, tried to get away from the man.
Millions of people watched the moment of shock live.
Economic Coordinating Board
The Economic Coordination Board (EKK) met under the chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek in charge of the economy.
Following the change of cabinet in the government, the EKK meeting, which was held for the first time under the leadership of Simsek, started at 18.30 at Çankaya Mansion.
The meeting will discuss Turkey's macroeconomic outlook.
The meeting, headed by Simsek, was attended by Finance Minister Naci Agbal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Labour and Social Security Jülide Sarıeroğlu, Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci, Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan, Undersecretary of Treasury Osman Çelik, Head of the Central Bank Murat Çetinkaya and related bureaucrats.
It is possible to get rid of the lumbar hernia in 45 minutes.
Noting that only 5 percent of patients should be operated on in the treatment of back hernia, Assoc. Dr. Oğuz Karaeminoğulları says, "The first step according to the patient's examination and imaging results is rest and medication."
Oğuz Karaeminoğluları, who specifically stated that interventional methods (such as epidural injection, radiofrequency techniques, intradiscussive interventions) should be tried in the patient group where the pain continues, warns that "If all of these methods are not successful, numbness and weakness in the legs become apparent, then surgery becomes mandatory."
Karaeminoğulları stated that 'full-closed lumbar hernia surgery', which minimizes risk today, also allows for decreased reservations about surgery for patients who cannot be concluded by interventional methods, explaining that it is possible to get rid of lumbar hernia disease in 45 minutes:
Although there are quite good results compared to open surgery with microscopic surgery, some complications can be encountered after the operation, such as long recovery period, adhesions to the spinal cord, a recurrence of the hernia, and a lumbar shift and infection that may develop in the future.
Most often, microscopic surgery is described as 'closed surgery', but microscopic surgery is also applied with the same approach as open surgery.
In full-closed lumbar hernia surgery, these risks are eliminated because the surrounding tissues are protected.
Full-closed lumbar hernia surgery lasts only 45 minutes.
Special commission at work
The commission will include CHP MPs Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Barış Yfriend and High Disciplinary Board Member Turan Aydoğan.
Commission, Berberoğlu's 14th Istanbul on October 4th.
His trial in the High Criminal Court will also follow applications to the Constitutional Court and the District Court of Appeal.
"It is an indispensable condition of justice that the judiciary should be independent and impartial, not taking orders from anywhere outside the law," CHP Secretary-General Kamil Okyay Sinın and Deputy President Bülent Tezcan wrote in the assignment.
"Our deputy, Mr. Enis Berberoğlu, did not demand any special status while serving as a deputy, did not seek asylum in the immunity armor recognized by the parliament, and wanted to protect his faith in the independent and impartiality of the judiciary."
The trial process was suggested that the court preferred to follow political orders rather than make judgments.
The article argued that despite the Constitutional Court's rulings that found the arrests of MPs to be false, the decision to arrest without a verdict was clear evidence that the court had taken a decision under influence.
Michelle Carter sentenced for messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will serve a 15-month sentence behind bars and serve five years as a legitimate evacuee.
Carter was convicted in June of the death of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Mr. Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing: "My family's heart is broken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to go free, with the fortification route open.
Although he faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, his legal team argued that both he and Mr. Roy suffered from mental illness.
Wearing red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter was being punished with old eyes, his hands clasped and his eyes looking down.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
He ended his life to heal his own.
He did not accept responsibility," he said.
"He never showed any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said, "it was a terrible situation that he regretted completely."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not see "any significant impact on the actions of his age, maturity level, or even mental illness."
A prosecutor read a statement by Lynn Roy, Mr. Roy's mother: "There is no day that I will not mourn for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of how I and I have overcome everything, and I'm trying to be with his sisters with all the pain we're going to carry forever."
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that the reality that he could never attend his brother's wedding, or that he would never be able to be with his children, was "out of his mind".
"The fact that the person you've been with every day since I was born is no longer a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life," he said.
Since there is no Massachusetts law that criminalizes telling a person to commit suicide, the lawsuit seems to create a case.
Carter was 17 years old when Mr. Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it was revealed that Carter's text messages encouraged him to end his own life.
While she was on vacation with her family, the girl said in many of her messages two weeks before her death, "Hang yourself, jump out of a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there's a lot of roads."
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz instructed him not to be allowed to take advantage of this case through the press, saying Carter wanted to attract attention through Mr Roy's death.
The case divided legal views.
Among the minority defending Carter was Amanda Knox, who was found guilty of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, before being cleared two years ago.
Mrs. Knox (30) published an article in the Los Angeles Times that said, "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail."
Stunning growth forecast from Mehmet Simsek
In his statement, Simsek stated that inflation in Turkey should go down to low single-digit figures and that food inflation constitutes a "risk field".
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation will fall below 7 per cent in 2018.
In his Lightning speech, he said:
The next 12 months are critical in decreasing uncertainty.
The greatest incentive is to reduce uncertainty.
There is a strong government.
No political ambiguity.
I hope that the uncertainties in our immediate geography also decrease.
With some reform, I believe by increasing our resistance to shocks, we will put Turkey on a growth trend of over 5 percent.
I said it months ago.
Because the worst is left behind.
Gradually, we no longer focus our energy on those areas, but on the reforms that will enable our energy to grow inclusively, to increase employment.
So the next 12 months are critical.
On the one hand, reform, on the other hand, is declining uncertainty, there is no political uncertainty.
We hope that our chances will be better and that the hardships in our immediate geography will decrease.
Whether we like it or not, many of our classic markets have collapsed.
Libya, like Iraq.
We're not just losing Sunday, we're dealing with over 3.5 million migration waves.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, so we have solid problems with our foundations.
Now with some reform, by increasing our resistance to shocks, we also have some more of the question marks in the heads of investors, putting Turkey back on a growth policy of over 5 percent.
Let me be clear, we have such a generous retirement system.
I think it would be reasonable if I said that our retirement companies didn't try hard enough.
Once the auto is in attendance, the performance will be strong.
Why not?
Because we took precautions.
Firms don't have to go and spend effort and expense.
We have worked on these concerns, taking into account the poor performance, how to allocate global assets to what investment areas.
In the deposit, you know, the returns are high.
Once there will be a performance there in addition to the 25 percent given by the state clearly.
The rest is on treasury papers, where the risk is generally low.
When we look at the big picture, I think the interest will increase in the coming period.
Because they'll see the performance.
There is no failure in the other area, there is success.
We restructured BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, a savings of $70 billion.
Give it up, the system has been successful.
There are 2.6 million participants in the automatic turnout, and 775 million dollars in savings.
We want some more effort from the firms.
Let them advertise a little bit, tell us about this system.
We're working on the withdrawal period.
Maybe if we stretch him a little...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe the citizens will see the return, see the savings, and stay in the system.
The output from the system is 38 percent.
Almost half of those who have left have voluntary individual pensions.
You don't want two individual retirement accounts.
What are you doing?
You're exiting auto participation.
We were actually expecting a break around 10 percent.
And there we were, which means we were very optimistic.
Once the system works.
We brought a prime ceiling.
Insurance companies sometimes explain it unilaterally.
They increased their premiums very quickly.
When we asked what was going on, they said that judicial decisions do not take into account the current regulations.
We have made new net edits.
We thought you guys should do it.
They said, ‘No, let us wait for judgment.
So we said that's not how this works.
We have a difference of opinion here.
Of course, when this ceiling went into the premium application, some companies did.
We made a new arrangement.
We've created a pool of risk insurers.
Let me tell you this, let me repeat.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
So I don't find these ceiling price applications right, they forced us.
I'd like to look at this in three dimensions.
Let the system we are doing be considered.
Two, let the system operate normally, a price on that trail.
In addition to it, the burden is heavy, with almost $30-31 of every $100 premium paid for going to tax SGK cuts.
I'm working now, too, and we're going to talk to our finance minister.
Third, technology is evolving rapidly.
Now, over time, traffic accidents will also be severely reduced structurally.
But it's mandatory traffic insurance.
The headline of "SABAH" saved his leg
Buerger's disease, which originated from adolescence, used to be an ailment in men, but it is now common in women as well.
One of these women is Mehtap Dursun, 36.
Their pain, which began two years ago, became chronic on the sole of the foot.
The hospital wandered when the young woman, having trouble walking, was at risk of losing her leg.
A friend suggested Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
He showed the news that 'Azerbaijan saved the life of the Minister of Emergency Situations', which was the headline in SABAH.
It was then revealed that Dursun, who had gone to Kalko, was struggling with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko put the young woman into emergency surgery.
Dursun, who soon recovered from his pain, is now undergoing oxygen therapy.
Audi to Modify 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Automobile Manufacturers Face Reverse Reaction
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman of the board said he believed the firm had "more intelligent options than driving limitations", referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW's headquarters (where diesel vehicles are thought to be banned or restricted).
Daimler said Tuesday it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the firms described these moves as recalls.
European automakers had heavily encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are considered cancer-forming and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment that automotive companies need to install to neutralize the nasty smoke generated by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult for cars to remain competitive.
While German automakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Firms are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which hides its use of the device known as a misleading device and adjusts the emissions to fit regulations when an automobile is tested and loosens it in normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Audi's engine development division, the former head of thermodynamics had been arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore is not protected against extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi had been dragged into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen; authorities had expanded the United States-based investigation after accusing Audi of installing a system to get rid of emissions rules in Europe.
Audi's involvement in the investigation may be heavy on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer has an excessive share in Volkswagen's profits.
Don't jump fishing at everything you see
Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, President of Turkish Neurosurgery Association, warned not to jump from 2 meters to shallow places, which are not sure of its depth.
Thousands of people are at risk of stroke each year due to a neck fracture and spinal cord damage from diving into shallow water.
Neck fractures most often develop in the 5th or 6th vertebrae.
The feature of fractures is that at this level it affects the arms and leg muscles as well as the nerves that feed the respiratory muscles.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar said, "In such accidents, our most valuable organ, the cervical spinal region, is cut or compressed by the vertebrae that are broken down due to the fracture, leaving it out of function."
"Wrong first aid in spinal injuries not only increases damage to survivors, but can also lead to death," he said.
Diving into the water ranks fourth in spinal cord injuries.
The average age of the injured was 20-29 and the majority were male.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "Swimming into water that cannot be seen inside should not be skipped."
"No matter how well it dives, there may be a severe injury."
Prof. Dr. Çağlar also recalled:
Different degrees of paralysis may occur in the arms and legs, depending on the level of the spinal cord at the site of injury while diving.
You may know how to swim, but water can be deceptive.
The place that seems deep to you may be shallow.
In the United States and Australia, there was a 70 percent reduction in cases of diving into shallow water thanks to warning signs placed on the seashore.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar said, "Despite the fact that 28 provinces have a seaside presence in Turkey, unfortunately there is not a single warning sign in places outside Istanbul."
"The health department of every pre-summer province, under the school and social awareness project, should have a remarkable presence of information light or information boards on beaches and pools in relation to these types of accidents that are life-determining," he said.
Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, the President of the Spinal and Peripheral Neurosurgery Group of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, suggested that the following should be done in case of injury:
112 calls must be made first at the time of the incident.
The neck should be kept as steady as possible, not moved, with a hard collar.
The airway must be supplied and the patient must be inverted to the side for drainage of the water escaping into the lung.
It should not be held from the legs and hung to drain the water.
The deformity in the patient's neck should not be corrected.
The cervical vertebrae may be broken.
However, if the spinal cord is not yet damaged, first aid and an inappropriate position to be given to the neck during the patient's transport may cause broken bone fragments to press the spinal cord and cut and damage.
Provence lavender under threat of climate change
It had become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is experiencing a decline due to drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache to scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIPPAM, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which brings much less rain in the spring and mostly in the fall.
This affects the life of the lavender.
There is also a small cicada, which is a leaf pest that transmits microbacteria, and it happens a lot in very dry air."
And a lot of things are at stake.
As much as it attracts the holidaymakers, it's going after a lot of lavender oil for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "While we should have very long plant spikes with a few large flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped, or weak spikes that are none at all.
So we have less essential fatty parts."
The revised solutions include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of slime and water and developing more resistant species to dry conditions.
Journalist highlights growing threat to murder in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce often meet Wednesdays to review the latest turmoil in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officers, and plans for endless drug wars to be included in the newspaper.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to discuss their security.
They were told it was important for them to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: bringing their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column; no evidence is needed, perceptions and inner voices are enough.
Journalists suspected of drug traffickers, politicians, business people, government, or cartels tying wages are bad men who make it dangerous to write a list of Mexico's chaos in the paper.
There are no denominators in violence, with the number of bodies increasing across the country, with even more of them becoming journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats, and at least seven in seven states so far this year.
Recent deaths include editor-in-chiefs and inspirations from Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," writes Valdez in one of his many books on narcotics violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is everywhere, with a large photograph of Valdez showing his middle finger hanging on the facade of Riodoce's building with the word "Justice"; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, are wearing t-shirts that show his smile, his face with glasses, and his Panama hat with omen.
The workshop takes place two months before her death; reporters discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was created in 2010 to address journalist cases, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two were prosecuted.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists' killers are rarely brought before the law.
In Riodoce, they insist on addressing violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken, although the ground is now more deceptive.
Negotiating security without knowledge of murderers, without justice, is of little use, says Ibarra.
"It's stupid to waste my time at this workshop," he says.
"Unless we know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
The red Toyota Corolla was only able to drive a few blocks before it was stopped by two men; it was forced out of its vehicle and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of its newspaper, which translates as the Twelfth River.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed the vehicle nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two adult children remained.
Rumors tend to circulate freely in Culiacan.
But there's almost nothing about Valdez but silence.
Last year, after Guzman's arrest and his extradition to the United States in January, rival groups fought to fill the gap, while Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country.
Never mind the fact that every day in the street in Sinaloa, someone or many people are shot and killed, or that the cemetery is filled with mausoleums bigger than many houses where drug kings are fancy, two-story, to live in.
For a minute, just forget about the "silence" situation when the single cartel controls their precious ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite being deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and director of Riodoce, was devastated by his guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the murder.
One was an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel groups that was at war with Guzman's sons, in a February broadcast.
This article may have angered the sons; prospective gang members purchased every copy of the raid as soon as it was distributed to newsstands.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper containing the same story was confiscated.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for too long, his friends and co-workers assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste in 2013 when he joined five of his co-workers selling $50 shares in Riodoce's discovery.
"It was impossible to do journalism without addressing the narcotics issue," Bojorquez said in Sinaloa.
Over time, the newspaper became famous for its bold and honest news, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish life-threatening research without fear of censorship, and readers were caught up in a publication where they could read stories that no one dared to report.
Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for reporting in Latin America eight years after its establishment.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for having the courage to let go of the Mexican drug story no matter where it goes.
She admitted she was clearly scared.
"I want to go on living," he said during the CPJ awards.
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said drug trafficking in Sinaloa was "a way of life".
"As a journalist, you have to accept your duty to play this or that fool.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?'
Riodoce staff miss Valdez, the cursing prankster like the porter, his friends who are generous in their embrace and advice, his teachers who know how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He would go to a bar called El Guayabo across from the office and sit at the same table all the time.
Now they ask: Has his love for his routines collapsed?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and survive.
"They don't like it if you deal with their women, their children, their clean jobs, the secret airstrips they use to transport drugs."
"These things were crossing the line," Bojorquez said.
The result was a high-grade self-censorship and self-preservation, even at the best of times.
Trusting your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away.
"The smell is a sense that can be cheated... and what happened to Javier happened," said Andres Villarreal, the Riodoce editor-in-chief.
He and others say that the old rules do not apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that host snow smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials, a toxic mixture.
The ground is constantly changing.
No cell phones are suddenly allowed in the room where Riodose staff meet for security training; days ago, it was revealed that spyware, which was only sold to governments, had been used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers wanted to get rid of the 104-degree (40 Celsius) temperature, in the shade of a tree.
They were allocated by the state government to protect Riodoce's office in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Partly serious, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police that the governor himself said were unreliable.
Reporters have been going to the mountainous countryside, where drug gangs have actually controlled it for months.
In this week's issue, Riodoce delves into three main stories.
Former great boxer Julio Cesar Chavez had his brother's murder in Sinaloa.
There was also disclosure of government spending concentrated on the governor's hometown.
And then there was the kidnapping of a group at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant a block from the prosecution.
There was no official explanation of who was kidnapped or how, so caution prevailed when it came time to write down what everyone in the city knew: the restaurant was a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a member of the Corporate Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the administration, which dominated almost every level of politics of the last century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about earlier events, including the escape of one of "El Chapo" Guzman's sons in a troop raid at that scene.
Just months ago, readers would look around Valdez's corner for information from the best source on the kidnapping.
Villareal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its thin structure, said, "We would have known what was going on in the first place."
"All of our communication channels with our resources have now been cut off."
As the staff turns into something they never expected, activists on behalf of the press, Valdez's office is being re-used as a repository for banners and stickers protesting journalist killings.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up a few banners and appeared at the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was found, and according to DNA tests, official officials say it was him.
Journalists across the country became more vocal in expressing their thoughts by writing "aid to the press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
Today, director Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in the case of Valdez, in Washington, far away.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
From that day on, he wanted to be appointed to a post other than doing government news, thinking that his anger had undermined his neutrality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are being "circulated" by organized crime, complicity official officials, and a carefree society.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism", he wrote that journalists were being killed not only by drug gangs, but at the behest of politicians and security forces in cooperation with organised crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 linked most of the attacks on journalists last year to police and officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
The murders clearly had a cold shower effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found along with a note said to have been signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and headphone, serrated next to his severed head.
After reporter Miroslava Breach was killed in March in the northern border province of Chihuahua, some publications such as El Norte chose to close down.
Others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after his principals were killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad addressed the drug cartels with the following editorial on the Juarez front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their own states, even the country.
This is a wrinkled decision.
It's hard to get a job in exile, and they're still combing the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after escaping Veracruz, they are captured as if they were to be understood by photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in an apartment building in Mexico City with four women in 2015.
It's a daily dance with these high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and continue to work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, says that reporting the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Saturday, as preparations were being made for the final issue to be finished, Riodoce editor-in-chiefs sat on the sidewalk outside the office drinking beer, while simultaneously ringing the phones.
A series of armed clashes involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a beach resort, caused 19 confirmed deaths.
As promised in a series of surrounding cartel messages, the war continued to escalate.
They put the news on Riodoce's website via cell phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
The sirens began to crow nearby, fighting with another weapon in the vicinity.
Bojorquez quickly glanced at the police officers on guard to see if they were on the lookout.
If they were scared, they weren't showing.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founders of his newspapers, his middle finger was on display for the whole of Sinaloa to see, Riodoce's staff following in his footsteps.
"How can you think about shutting it down," said Bojorquez, "when on the day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him outside to report on the street?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid its enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but to a horrible one.
Researchers have now explained that the initial findings of an incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner are very well preserved, with experts describing it as the 'Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
It was so well preserved that they could tell that the flake skin was reddish brown and that it had a 'problematic past'.
The report in Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur breeds in the world'.
The fossil is a newly discovered nodosaur species that lived 110 million to 112 million years ago from the middle of the Cretaceous Period.
His extraordinarily well-maintained condition stunned researchers who described him as 'really spectacular'.
Plant-eating armored is the best preserved fossil found in its species, according to reports from National Geographic.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 while digging the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta Canada.
He hit something that looked strange to the rock around him and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil that was discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next 6 years uncovering the wild animal from inside a pile of 2,500 pounds (1100 kg) of dirt.
After such intensive work, the completed result is now ready to be put forward.
Lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display, said, "If you shorten your eyes a little bit, you might even believe that you're almost asleep."
'It will be one of the most beautiful in the history of science and one of the best preserved dinosaur species, the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By examining his skin, the researchers found that although he was covered in armor and looked like a walking tank, this plant-eater was likely facing a serious threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
He used his red and white camouflage to hide from dinosaur predators, which were heavily armored, and used a protective technique known as contra-shadowing, which many modern-day animals also used.
Experts suggest that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to blend better into its environment and bypass its enemies.
The creature from the 110-million-year-old nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers have now finished their work and named the wild animal Borealopelta markmitchelli, dedicated to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to uncover it.
The extraordinary preservation of the species made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and his international team of scientists to document the shape and armor on the body by the pattern of the stamps.
They discovered contra shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although contrast shading is common, the findings are surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds those of contra shading animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur was under enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs to hunt, and evolution chose to confront hiding as a method of survival.
But the most contemporary animals using contrashading (e.g. deer, zebras, or armadillos) are much smaller and much more open to being a prey; this means that this nodosaur faced a serious challenge to survival.
'Strong hunting applied to a massive, heavily armored animal shows how dangerous dinosaur predators in the Cretaceous can be,' Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compositions in their stamps also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life, including preserved gut contents, to find out what it ate at its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where it sank onto the surface of the ocean on its back.
At the time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida is today, and probably rivers and oceans were spread far more inland than they are now.
"Nodozor is really notable for being completely covered and preserved with scaly skin, but also for the fact that the original shape of the animal was also preserved in a 3D way," Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need a lot of imagination to rebuild it; if you shorten your eyes a little, you might even believe that you're almost asleep."
Cretaceous was when giant teropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Though king of all, the Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, which may have been hunted by a number of majestic ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5m)-long, six-ton-weight monster.
The scientists, whose most recent findings are in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was dragged into the sea after she died and mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 while digging the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best preserved armored dinosaur, including leather and armor, and it is complete from nose to hip.
The creature averages around 18 ft (five meters) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has two 20-inch-long horns coming out of its shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armored weed herb wandered the bulky clunker at what is now Western Canada until it was dragged into the open sea by a overflowing river.
But the dinosaur's undersea tomb preserved its armor in perfect detail.
Fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved that skin fragments still cover layers of bumped armor along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a degree of preservation is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at her, the more incredible it is.
Fossilized skin fragments still cover layers of bumped armor that are dotted on the dinosaur's skull.
His right front leg lies next to him, with five fingers leaning upwards.
I can count the stamps on the soles of the foot."
When you say bleach, don't be your tooth.
White teeth and an aesthetic smile are every person's dream.
While people resort to all sorts of ways to whiten their teeth, Nukhet Berk, President of the Association for Oral Laser Applications, warns that products sold at the grocery store or on the internet should be avoided.
"Whitening teeth can be achieved by chemical substances applied by dentists or fine porcelain surfaces that adhere to the surface of the teeth like nail nails," Nukhet Berk says, noting that such substances sold scratch the enamel surface, which will never be recycled again.
Berk notes that maintaining dental health prevents the occurrence of many diseases, and that aesthetic practices are important for mental health, as they also give both dental and gum health and a beautiful smile. He shares the following information:
Young people's teeth are usually white unless there is a disorder or genetic factors in their dental structure.
Due to aging, drawing of tooth enamels, and frequent consumption of cigarettes, abrasives, or darkened beverages, teeth become darker over the years.
Whitening of teeth can be achieved with chemical substances applied by dentists or fine porcelain surfaces applied on the surface of teeth with minimal or no etching, sticking like false nails.
Never whiten teeth with products sold at the grocery store or on the internet.
Because, these substances draw the enamel surface, teeth are colored in such a way that it will never be recycled again.
Keçiören Municipality, 2011 to this side provides " Dental and Oral Health Service at Home" to elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens.
Köksal Güngör, 65, who has lived in Keçiören's Wake District for 24 years, said, "My wife has been aware of this service of Keçiören Municipality."
We called the city, they came right away.
"It's already paralyzed down my neck, thanks to this service, at least I'm not neglecting my dental care," he said.
Gülizar Taşçıoğlu's 72-year-old daughter, Kezban Gökçe, who lives in Pınarbaşı Neighborhood, said, "My mother has been bed dependent for 7.5 years because of old age."
When I came to the city, I saw the posters of this service and called immediately.
We have been receiving this service regularly for 4 years.
I have a problem with my teeth, and when the doctors come, they look at me too.
"We are very pleased," he said.
There is also no health insurance requirement for the service, which is completely free.
"Senior" incident in the Turkish army
My dear readers, very interesting decisions were made at the High Military Shura (YAŞ) meeting the previous day, especially for the Navy.
The command of this Force was not brought to command as an admiral, but as a admiral.
It's an almost unprecedented practice in our military.
And how did that happen?
The Commander of the Force, Admiral Bülent Bostanoglu, was already due to retire...
And it happened.
Now it was the turn of the command to Veysel Kösele, the only admiral.
Veysel Pasha, who had been a victim of conspiracy in the past and was imprisoned for some time, was supposed to be a commander in the order of normal seniority.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to put it very succinctly, starting at the top of the Navy, commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 were not promoted.
In this case, there was only one admiral left in the Navy.
He had to be brought to the vacant post: Admiral Veysel Kösele, Commander of the Navy at number two.
So what happened next?
Vice Admiral Adnan Özbal, who was in sixth place, was appointed to that office by the government.
Now look at this painting!
Admiral Veysel Kösele is standing there, but a lower-ranking commander is appointed instead!
A senior is being placed at the disposal of the underprivileged.
I wonder what will happen next.
An oratorial who is superior to rank does not serve, cannot, under the command of a lieutenant general, who is inferior to him.
He doesn't take orders from her, he can't.
In this case, Veysel Kösele will not tolerate this hurtful situation, if he has not been retired, he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is already the hurtful message given to him by the government: "Goodbye Veysel Pasha!"
The news had spread that he resigned yesterday afternoon when I wrote this article, but the situation had not yet been officially announced.
Now let's look at this again!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele for one reason or another, did not want to, forced him to resign, and instead brought a 6th-placed coramira into command, damaging our military's traditional "Kiddem" sense.
There must be politics involved, but we don't know behind the scenes.
Maybe if someone tells us soon, we'll find out together!
My dear readers, I have tried to tell you very briefly above, especially in the Turkish army, the seniority incident is very important.
Not just in rank.
For example, the officer who finished 10th in the War School is more senior than the one who finished 11th.
He is more senior to the general than he who was promoted from first place to second place.
We have experienced concrete examples of this seniority event in the Military War of Independence.
Garp Front commander Ismet Pasha...
He has two armies at his disposal.
Army and 2nd Army.
It is 1922, when our armies will carry out the great offensive and expel the Greek army.
At this stage, there are valuable names that are expected to be assigned to the military command.
One is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He is offered the command of the army, but he says, "The name is inferior to me, I cannot enter his command."
Another name is Yakup Shevki (Subaşı) Pasha.
Atatürk's teacher at the Academy of War...
He is a valued and senior commander who has been involved in a variety of wars, whom he loves, cherishes, addresses as "Teacher".
In 1919, he was captured along with military and civilian Turkish intellectuals and driven by the British to the island of Malta.
On his return home, he is reluctant to command the army and says the same thing: "The commander of the Western front is inferior to me, I cannot take orders from him".
However, Atatürk convinces him of gratitude for the request, and Yakup Shevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali İhsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A soldier who talks too much, criticizes all the time.
He was a commander who fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and on various fronts.
He is also exiled by the British to Malta, where he escapes and arrives in Ankara via Kusadasi.
Ali Ihsan Pasha says the same thing when he is offered the command of the army: "I cannot fight under Ismet, who is without seniority from me"...
But he's being persuaded...
But come and see that, after taking office, he is constantly arguing with Ismet Pasha, the commander of the Garp Front, whom he has taken command of, making a scene and making the army uneasy...
And shortly before the big offensive, he is sacked and retired, replaced by Nurettin Pasha with a beard.
After that, Ali İhsan Pasha's relationship with Atatürk never improves.
The issue of seniority in the Turkish army is not only prominent in war but also in peace.
Of course he has to go out.
Veysel Kösele is the last example of this.
How did an activist have to find out the answer to the question, "Who Are the Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
A day after arriving to New York City for a ride, St. Louis's native sat on Airbnb's bed, where he rented it, and began to wander on Facebook on his phone.
It coincided with the sharing of someone from high school.
"Police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street."
He was surprised to find that no one else shared this information in the content stream, turning off Facebook and turning on Twitter.
A user named @TheePharoah nickname was constantly being retweeted in his content stream.
Rapper from the St. Louis area was tweeting live about Michael Brown's death, an 18-year-old unarmed black man killed in Ferguson Missouri by a white police officer.
He shared a photograph of Brown's lifeless body in the street, which was to remain there for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is brutal."
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He left his phone later that same evening on Canfield Drive to return to tweets about the gathering of people.
There were police tapes, screaming people, and photographs of a man holding a banner claiming to be Brown's father, which read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
A live broadcast followed by a police officer standing with a dog barking in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another cop, he said, set the trigger for his rifle and shouted: "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell recalled saying, "'It's not usual.'
"'This is not the kind of murder we're used to and what we might call typical.'
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 a.m., he picked up his six-year-old daughter from his father's house and decided to go to Ferguson with her the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years will come to theaters on August 11, the subject of a new documentary called "Who Are the Streets?"
This is a story from the point of view of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance living in that society and filling the streets with answers they seek.
While Ferrell was driving his car to Ferguson with his daughter wearing a flowering dress and a suitable crown, they returned to the conversation that morning about the "experiences of blacks and the condition of blacks" they had done over and over again.
"Remember when I taught you that black people should fight because they believe?" he recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't true.
I couldn't have taken it," Ferrell said later.
"What happened here today... is a result of what happened in the past.
He must know it, see it, and grow up in it.
Not only should it develop well in the field of activism and organizing, but it should also know the layers of the black experience and its black state, and what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
If I were lucky enough to give him an experience that he would not personally experience rude racism, he would be no different from any black woman-child.
I get the feeling that I will be doing him evil by protecting him from them."
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, which turned into a sort of campground for activists, where they expected to talk about the issue across the street from the police station, which resulted in officer Darren Wilson not being charged later.
There, Ferrell and his daughter contacted local business owners who were preparing packaged food.
They prepared bags and helped deliver them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new form of activism was slowly taking shape.
When he was a student at Missouri State University, he determined that he was president of the Minority Students Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health injustice in the black community, saying, "My activism has completely transformed after August 9th."
"I had no experience organizing.
It came on its own."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, at an evening screening.
Folayan said he and his own cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "wanted to document" what was going on.
Ferrell had a question in mind: "Do you want to document it or are you trying to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism had been reported by numerous individuals, usually whites, to come to a society and profit from its suffering and resistance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson couldn't concentrate, and we decided to do it in a different way."
Folayan had already made contact with regional artist co-director Damon Davis, known for his activism regarding death row inmates.
His involvement warmed Ferrell to the project, followed by six other locals, as well as the "Whose Streets?" team, in the years after Brown's shooting.
David said, "This documentary is not about someone talking to us or talking to us; it's us talking."
"That was the main thing for me, how to represent these people because that's how I'm going to be represented."
"Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, it shows that the movement is not about a Christian leader, it is about bringing society together," Folayan said, while he proved that film participants are the most open.
As a result, "Who Are the Streets?", surprisingly, documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as his falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said, laughing at his first sight of the finished product.
"But while I was doing this job and humanizing black people, I knew there might be some sensitivity."
Ferrell's story also solidifies and re-centers the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who derived the #BlackLivesMatter slogan on social media after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay.
"Black gay women in leadership have generally kept the movement going," Ferrell said, "and that's because we're constantly at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all the weight of it."
Folayan added: "The movement is being held up by really black women and a lot of gay black women."
Nevertheless, Ferrell insists that "this is not the case when there is nothing of the kind of action that affirms" and that he was not chosen for their identity.
He says, "He was the one who put that energy into action."
"But it's not a coincidence that she's on the front lines, because as a black gay woman, you have a lot to lose by living a life at these intersections.
You can feel his energy from the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras are long gone in Ferguson, but there are alarming racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrell is under further surveillance for another two and a half years due to shutting down the highway during a demonstration.
He defines the socio-political atmosphere in what he calls home as a single word of confusion.
Nevertheless, Ferguson holds the song he carved into his memory exactly three years ago when he took to the streets.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Kyrie Irving: The world isn't round, it's flat!
Speaking to NBC Sports, Irving said, "The world is not round."
The world is flat.
They get people to get used to these things by providing them with fear.
Oh, man, don't question it too much.
Because, the more information you solve, the more information you get.
This is crazy.
Is the world flat?
Or does it revolve around itself in a round way?
I think you should look into it.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our faces.
They're lying to us! he used his words.
Irving said, "Over the years, I believed I wanted to believe."
I thought the world was round and round.
Do you really think we're spinning in the solar system?
Nothing they send back.
He's not coming back!
The information they give us is very inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for this fact.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?" he said.
Kyrie Irving, who claims that the world is flat, is fighting 24.4 points and 5.9 assist averages for the Cleveland Cavaliers this season.
An Affordable Similarity: Artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, there are many faces hanging over the wires in the ceiling, white, black, and brown, each almost indistinctly similar.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, with ear sticks and cut hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning, a former intelligence analyst who spent 35 years in prison after leaking classified diplomatic messages via the WikiLeaks website, sent his cut hair from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Consistent Similarity.
This is a product of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines his discipline with his expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a trans-woman and a leading dissident whose sentence is pardoned by Barack Obama, who is three days out of office.
By analyzing DNA algorithmically extracted from Manning and using what a person with this gene data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg created 30 portraits, revealing not only the processability of DNA data (there are many ways to interpret it, and its determinism from the essence of interpretations), but also its identity with a strict, perhaps somewhat cerebral interpretation.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but clearly identified himself as a woman in adolescence, was convicted of 20 crimes in 2013, six of which were from the Espionage Act, computer fraud, and theft.
His image was pressured by the prison, so much so that he had only one photograph: a sandy, black and white selfie in which Manning, who was visibly agitated, sat in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-yellow wig that missed him.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was succeeding with the massive silence of his 2012 project, the Weirder Premonitions.
In this, the artist created portraits by filtering DNA from the debris of forensic fragments such as cigarette butts and gum to draw a picture of what these people might look like.
At this time, he received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning while he was in prison and they wanted some sort of portrait that could accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press preview of the new exhibit.
Neither could he be visited at the time, nor could he be photographed, so they reached Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected pen pals, exchanging many letters over two years.
They even revealed the Printed Images, a cartoon book illustrated by Shoili Lawago, in which the president forgave Chelsea's punishment and imagined a future in which she could personally see the exhibit.
The fact that Obama really wanted Manning's release a few days after the book was released was a sort of happy coincidence that came well after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump has found new, tweetable ways to wage war on government leakers and transgender soldiers and further fuel the sharp divisions he is asked to repair, there is also something deep and powerful about this exhibition that is now opening.
When asked about the bizarre timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Things happen for a reason."
An artist's statement written on the gallery's wall, which Manning's huge-sized signature is below (the point of the "i" in his book was set with the heart), called for an end to "auto-discrimination" based on gender, race, sexuality, and culture.
Across the wall is his mitochondrial DNA sequence: many C's, G's, and A's written in pencil...
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scholarly dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to tell us how amazingly similar we all are, at least as biological creations.
"What I hope people get out of this is that they don't care about who our genome is and how open the genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work Imitation Memoirs is on display.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, and that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, held in a single room, is a page from the previously mentioned short comic book.
Here Manning is shown exiting the King Kong style, a handheld speaker from the United States Disciplinary Barracks.
It says, "When they silence your speech, they win."
"So never shut up."
"This came directly from a letter he wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibit (as he had been quite presumptuously envisioned from the book of cartoons) but when he sees it, he will be greeted by masks with their own genetic mimicry gathered in the middle of the room, like a group of protestors.
Like everything else in the exhibition, the genetic haplogroups were written in pencil to Manning's height (5"2, Manning's height), which was specifically done.
Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits, "In the past, I would have put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd."
"I wanted it to be perceived as a collective movement shaped by Chelsea, which is like the movement behind her emancipation."
Northwestern educator and Oxford University employee Wanted for Murder
Police say a nationwide manhunt has been launched for a Northwestern University educator and Oxford University employee who was wanted as a suspect after he was found stabbed to death in a luxury apartment building in Chicago.
Cook administration district records show that on Monday, the arrests for first-degree murder without bail for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were removed for alleged involvement in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after being stabbed many times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27.
Officers received a phone call, reached Grand Plaza Apartments, and found the victim with many deep cuts on her body.
Official sources said Cornell-Duranleau was reported dead at the scene, and investigators investigated the stabbing as a murder while police were actively searching for the two suspects.
Lathem has been an associate professor at Northwestern University in microbiology and immunology since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was on administrative leave and that he was banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
"We are in touch with the UK police and are ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in whatever way they need," a spokesman for the University and the University of Somerville said in an email.
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Communications Chief Anthony Guglielmi of the Chicago Police Department said he strongly encouraged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to identify them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police had received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who had just received a mysterious hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as too horrific.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident was also on July 27.
He said that Lathem and Warren's presence in the building was confirmed by security cameras.
"We believe that the victim was having an affair with Latham, a member of the teaching community," Guglielmi said.
The management staff at Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents saying: "The police are still working on the victim's timeline and background and are investigating a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Italy seizes German ship
Italian police have announced that the ship Iuventa, which was on search-and-rescue activities in the Central Mediterranean, was seized on Lampedusa Island yesterday.
The police, who also shared with journalists the records of phone conversations, which the organization claimed belonged to two members, announced that the operation was carried out as part of an investigation launched in October 2016 by the Trapani Prosecutor's Office.
Jugend Rettet members, who are alleged to have "also operated in favor of illegal immigration on the Libya-Italy line", have, at least three times, brought asylum seekers directly from Libyan human traffickers' boats to Italy.
Jugend Rettet members, who have been questioned by the prosecution, have also alleged to have committed this crime, along with some members of the Libyan Coast Guard.
On top of that, the organization said it was assessing the charges against them, stating that their priorities would continue as saving human lives.
In addition to ships under the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, there are about 9 international NGOs involved in the search-and-rescue of asylum seekers in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government had drafted a 13-point code of conduct document for these organizations to comply, requiring that it be signed.
Last minute: 5 kiosks of Banlı that attacked Büyükersen sealed
After the attack on Eskişehir Metropolitan Mayor Yılmaz Büyükersen, he was taken into custody by the police and sealed by Tepebaşı Municipality, the five kiosks of retired police Mahfuz Banlı, who was arrested by the court where they were removed.
According to Habertürk's report; Municipal teams were accompanied by numerous police and Agile Force teams.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA roadmap in the short term"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to become operational again.
"A specific phase has been completed in meeting the roadmap criteria, RUSADA has gained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this context," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Regulation Compliance Roadmap, which was recently published on the institution's website, describing the criteria governing the re-operating of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, this does not include anything to worry Russia about.
"Everything has been announced, all will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one criterion mentioned in the list is that anti-doping officials of Russia must publicly accept the reported results of the alleged state-sponsored doping investigation in Russian sport by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, approved by WADA.
Referring to the issue, Mutko said: "While our anti-doping system acknowledges a failure, we are conducting the investigation.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no state program, and we will not accept anything that did not exist."
Mutko's remarks echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission of Russia.
Speaking to the Russian broadcaster RSport early in the day, Smirnov acknowledged his past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said at many opportunities that the report contains positions and regulations that create opposition.
No one is considering accepting the report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
It had been suspended by WADA for doing doping controls within Russia following the November 2005 doping scandal.
However, under the supervision of international experts and the United Kingdom Anti-Doping (UKAD), this June testing planning and coordination was allowed.
In July, following a visit to the institution's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli announced that the RUSADA was "going in the right direction" to become things again.
100 million people watched it!
"Come to Beşiktaş" content video, which Beşiktaş announced the transfer of Negredo, soon reached 100 million people from 18 countries.
Decorated with the dialogues of Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo, the video was also shared from the websites of key newspapers such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazatta dello Sport.
The President of Galatasaray does not return empty-handed.
Faruk Soren, the former president of Galatasaray, harshly criticised Dursun Uzbek, who went to Bucharest and the capital city of Ankara for the transfer of Ndiaye to convince Mircea Lucescu.
Here are the legendary president's special statements for the Sabah readers:
Lucescu-Uzbek interview: "We were finishing when we left."
The President of Galatasaray does not go for nothing, nor does he return empty-handed.
Ndiaye transfer: Galatasaray President does not go to football.
The football player comes to the President's feet.
Of course they meet, whether they kiss your hand or embrace it...
But no matter who the player is, the president doesn't get on his feet.
You give 9 million euros to the player that Ottomanspor bought for 300 thousand Euros...
He's not going to be 7.5 million, he's going to be 9 million with bonuses!
You've already invested a lot, of course you're going to play it and it's going to be 7.5 9...
Uzbek's actions: I don't want to criticize.
But the situation is clear.
G.Sararay values are eroded.
It's not just football, it's all wrong.
It is the Council of the Court and the General Assembly that will change this.
But as far as I can tell, the members are pleased!
Start-ups to help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee happiness in the e-commerce start-up, but the polls weren't working.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or even worse, deceptive.
Even if he committed anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company on hair care in San Francisco, says "it never had any amount or objectivity."
So he called outsiders to help.
A new kind of human resources startup is emerging to enable companies to understand how their employees feel.
These enable companies to conduct quick-choice surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer anonymity and complaint relief lines to employees, and in some cases bypass senior executives and go directly to the board of directors to allow employees to announce a misconduct.
Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analysis tools measure the busyness of employees by companies, said, "Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that monitor your health, but where is your company's Fitbit?"
Using Glint, Errett says, he understands better what his employees think and feel three years later.
In addition to offering quick surveys and optional surveys to specific teams, it offers a heat map in which parts of the company are shown to receive the most complaints and a look at which manager has low rating points so that the reasons for them can be tampered with.
In order not to be the next Uber, companies are beginning to understand that they need to know about the culture of their workplace; Uber has been in a scandal ever since Uber described a harassment environment in which people who openly say what they think in a blog post published by a former employee are being punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this surveillance request means a very profitable business opportunity.
According to financial technology insights website Let's Talk Payments, the global management, regulatory and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
Interest and effectiveness in the Denver Colorado-based start-up Convert, which helped companies detect and block bad behavior, increased amid controversy over Uber's discredit earlier this year.
Convercent has close to 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to perform personalized "pulse" polls, collect real-time hidden responses, and extract heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous message that employees can report bad behavior.
If the president is charged, the complaints go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Covercent, said, "The public court has taken over the regulators."
Quinlan said that if a company is misbehaving or unethical with its employees, it may face costly consequences due to consumer boycotts, employee casualties, or lawsuits, even if regulators do not engage.
With more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, the restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday has been using Convercent for more than a year to keep its employees aware of the principles and procedures and provide a way to easily reach the company headquarters.
When a previous employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or e-mail belonging to the company headquarters, making an official complaint, and hoping it would be taken seriously.
James Vitrano, chief legal counsel for Ruby Tuesday, said that these were mostly intimidating and disturbing experiences, not a good way to track employee complaints.
But now, with the company using Convercent, problems that had previously been hidden from executives who lived within office, city, or state distances (such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair pay practice) can be identified and resolved more quickly.
"I can get closer to this employment experience from a holistic, 360-degree perspective," said Vitrano, who led Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"We also protect our shareholders against business lawsuits."
In 2002, after accounting firm Arthur Andersen sank due to a breach of ethical values stemming from the Enron scandal, the companies discussed ethics, values, and relationship with the employee more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after "social media" regained consciousness, firms realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going viral.
"Before technology was used to oversee ethics, people were using hope as a strategy," he said.
They offer both Glint and Convercent software as a service and charge recurring fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who support both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising its total capital to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, raising its total funding to $60 million.
Given the interconnected nature of the companies, their culture, and their venture capital, these investments are hardly a surprise.
Increased amounts of research show that today's employees expect more from the workplace than they did before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only minimal requirements.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, vice president of LinkedIn's global benefits and employee experience, who uses both Convercent and Glint, said: "When people are happy to be in a company, feel their voice heard, and the work they do is satisfactory, they are more sincere to make that company successful."
Investors profit when their own portfolio companies do well; companies do well if their employees are sincere and feel they belong to the company.
If third-party analysis tools promise to increase employees' sincerity and sense of belonging, it is not surprising that they find support.
Having data on employee engagement is important to workplace culture experts.
But the data is useless if the company's handlers don't take action.
In fact, if a company wants feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that change is coming.
And if the expectation doesn't come fast enough or never comes at all, it can cause frustration and make employees feel disconnected.
Russell Raath, who is the head of consulting at the business management firm Kotter International and sees that companies have made the mistake of relying too much on data collection, said, "If you're going to want 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to talk 4,000."
"Because if you don't follow, the employees will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day a problem was reported in Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were tired of the speed of decision-making mechanism and communication quality, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and add communication training to solve problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights into its own employees, and in the long run hopes that this will turn out to be able to hold more workers in this type of industry, which is known to be a high number of employee input outputs.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you lose people."
"And if you lose people, you will lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose firms."
It's a long day for Bruins as the NCAA removes two workouts every day.
The clock comes at 11:00 a.m., and a mob of UCLA football players hang out to chat on the side of the team's new training ground on campus.
Some grazed the tops of their jerseys, revealing their sweat-slicked backs from the trouble of the first day at the training camp.
For a significant part of the team, these spare minutes are the midday break.
After 3 hours of training, players enrolled in summer classes will return to their dorms and study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6.30 a.m. the next morning.
Just before Bruins coach Jim Mora returned Tuesday, he said: "The next three days are a torment for these men."
The NCAA's lifting of two workouts a day, held to lift the burden on the players, actually extended their days, at least until the finals ended on Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three workouts were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m., to accommodate the players' already jammed schedule.
The lack of two trainings per day is more like one training per day; Bruins takes the start of the camp forward by about a week compared to last season, and during summer school he trains in summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They plan to train 18 by August 20, before they begin formal match preparations for their opening against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change, although he added new pens to the players' busy schedule.
Mora said: "We put a huge burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging."
"And they've been through this recently; they're working, they're great kids.
I think we'll have more time when we get to Saturday, it's going to be really great."
UCLA will stop their training at the end of the camp; the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which is rained by the parking lot next door and the football next door, and closes the back of the castle with a protective net, is not an easy task, given that their field lies on the line of sight.
Players from Bruins are scheduled to settle in the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora admits that there may be a problem with the emptying of these rooms during the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"It's a real concern, and it's not too extreme to think that someone is going to rent a room and sit there and videotape a workout.
If a workout has a video recording, that's a pretty good thing.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security up there at parking lot eight.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
Facebook boosts story verification power to fight fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party story verifiers and show their findings under the original sharing; this is how the world's largest online social network tried to combat what they called fake news on Thursday.
The firm said in a statement on its website that they would use updated machine learning to detect possible frauds and send them to story verifiers, potentially showing story verification results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points of news, which many consider to affect the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem also became a major political topic in Europe when French voters flooded with fake news before the presidential election in May and Germany backed a plan to cut penalties if they failed to quickly remove hateful posts to social media networks before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new story verification feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Facebook news feed product manager Sara Su said in a blog post, "In addition to seeing what stories are being discussed by third-party story verifiers, people want more resources about what they read and share to make informed decisions."
He added that Facebook would continue to test the "related article" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating comics: The story of a Castle in England
In his recent past, Little Scotney Castle appeared in a Squeeze music video and became a haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But now, inspired by a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire with broom hair, a passion for historical documents, Scotland has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent.
"I find it very nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says emphatically.
"How it is a personal bond to keep this letter in my hand."
A Castle in England from the Edwardian era to the Middle Ages, each story documents families living in Scotland to be illustrated by a different artist (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg) mentioned in the United Kingdom.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he also wrote Teeth of the Dead Men and Other Stories in 2014, a project he found unexpectedly emotional, inspired by stories from the British Library.
"My eyes are filled with even the fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent who works for King James fans," he says.
"It was the print of his thumb!
The letters always smell of work, too, because at the time you would light a fire for light.
For someone 300 years into the future, that smell feels like he's there too.
Oh, I love archives!"
As someone who is in love with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the UK Arts Council and staying in a castle for almost four months ("I've been a little over my welcome, to be honest.") seems to be too good.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the "new" castle of Victorian times, scanning archives, and studying many treasures and antiques, such as hyena heads mounted on the walls of the mansion and bottles that had spent centuries in ditches.
He traveled the lands and ruins of the old castle, talking to the Rangers, gardeners, and sometimes artists working on illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he "drinked the viski and started writing".
Scotney's detailed history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was only able to access full access when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only begun to address the archive, which he described as follows: "Aristocrats centuries old have been saying, 'Oh, throw him into the attic.'"
The diaries, letters from the days of the British empire, maps that set the limits of who had what: "You think land disputes would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch tree over which the two families fought.
Forget it, guys!"
Some stories in the collection, including The Labourer, who left the newly built fort to join the Peasant Rebellion in 1381, use the fort as a stepping stone to make a wider entrance into English history.
"In this book, Knight Families of Kent and Sussex, there is a record of rebellion in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The Peasant Rebellion started around here, and I thought a rebellion might be a good starting point.
Maybe these two are connected?"
Other stories are closely linked to the castle's history, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family who kept a Jesuit priest for seven years during the English Isles.
Or The Smuggler (a revelation made years later when the coffin was removed from the ground) featuring Arthut Darrell, an 18th-century smuggler who was thought to have filled a coffin with stones and staged his own funeral.
The Darrells were Rhodes' favorite Scotney family: "These gentlemen seemed to be quite deceitful, always going into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men solved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women; I imagine them to be a group of handsome men who are capable of courting female heirs."
Rhodes, whose mission at the castle is over, is in search of other singular writing experiences.
In Finnish wildlife, he completed a two-week job for a comic book about a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, which had since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a separate place in his heart.
"I was sorry to leave," he says.
"It's like: 'Oh, now I have to go and face his fucking real life.'
'Maho' response to Meral Eveninger
Ismet Büyükataman, the Secretary General of the Nationalist Movement Party, recently made a written statement regarding the allegations of resignation in the social media and media related to the MHP.
Büyükataman used the phrase "but flowed" from social media and "from the corners of some old rifle Marxists" to the MHP, suggesting that "games and stalls were resorted to to prevent the conservative movement from continuing under the roof of the MHP after 12 September."
The Grandmaster said:
He rubs his hands if he can't digest the historical existence of the Turkish nation, he can't attract the homeland of the Turkish people, he has a broken record, his criminal file is fluffy, his mind is blurry, his mind is confused."
"Now they are out "MHP Kocaeli Gölcük District Agency administration and 410 of its members and 215 of its members have resigned in Yenişehir district of MHP Bursa".
The public is misled by unfounded news such as 250 resignations, 300 resignations.
In the newspaper columns, the lie is devolved, the deception deepened.
As there is no resignation that reaches our hands in this number, the number of stalwarts in the aforementioned places does not exceed the fingers of one hand.
Büyükataman, who described the resignations as "so-called", said that the public was being tried to be misled and to make perception management, again with surveys he referred to as "so-called".
"These will backfire on propaganda and campaigns to create perceptions against the MHP," Büyükataman said.
Expressing that MHP is an important and indispensable actor of Turkish politics, MHP Secretary-General Büyükataman said of the resignations:
The power of the old Marxists is not enough, as the MHP has a sword to destroy the place it acquired in the conscience of the Turkish nation.
A dirty account lies behind all the comments made, the methods of perception management implemented.
Because politics and the media have set their sights on the MHP base.
It makes no sense to us that those who have done no good work or effort in favor of our party, while we are among us, are now resigning.
Those who could not take advantage of our party on their behalf have resigned, what gam?
In their lives, the mentality that has not touched the MHP well, shared our memories, did not understand our countries, did not participate in our struggle, has always stood on the sidelines should be charred, the heart-stoned mob should find another preoccupation for themselves.
The efforts of those who are unable to attract the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party to sedition, to argue, and to seek out factions are a futile endeavor.
And he will turn around and shoot the owner.
The Nationalist Movement is the last standing stronghold of the Turkish nation despite heavy destruction.
In his statement, Büyükataman said "political counterfeiters" and "political snatchers" for those he claims are targeting the MHP, "The nationalist movement is not without owners."
"The external altars inside, whose root is fed beyond the ocean, will not achieve their goal at all costs," he said.
Using the phrase "Damaged traitors will go mad and be burned in a small fire", Büyükataman of MHP said in his statement that they would not be able to operate on the right of the Turkish nation to claim its own destiny, from "CHP to HDP; from there to Perinçekgils to PKK to FETÖ".
Yesterday we resisted the new tactics and games of those who planned without Turkes, without MHP; we fought until the end with the bastards who wanted the MHP government, without MHP Parliament.
Now we're going to disrupt the games, we're going to ruin the players.
"The patent of the power is in the MHP," said Büyükataman, referring to Meral Akşener, "as in the film Banker Bilo, an old Yeşilçam production, Maho says I will take the villagers to Germany, just as he left them on a mountain slope of Istanbul after driving them around in a truck safe for days, the resignationists of the person they were chasing are over the edge of the cliff."
It's their issue, but all we want from these prodigals is for them to be new to where they're going.
Kjaer signs for Seville
Kjaer signed the official contract, which was transferred from the yellow-blue team to Seville at a price of 12.5 million euros, and was dated as the Spanish team's most expensive defensive transfer.
The Danish star will wear jersey number four in Seville.
For families with babies, it's easy from your THY.
The national airline, which prioritizes the flight comfort and satisfaction of its passengers and works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight, continues to develop new ideas for an excellent travel experience, according to a statement from THY Press Consultancy.
In this direction, the "baby travel kit", prepared by examining the needs of infants and their families between 0 and 2 years old, began to be offered to passengers with infants travelling on intercontinental flights starting in August.
The kit, which is prepared with a specially designed bag, includes substitution cover, disposable food apron, cook cream, baby lotion and shampoo, newborn wet cotton wipes and breast pads.
Products that do not contain harmful chemicals with parabens, alcohol, paint were produced considering the sensitivity of the baby's skin.
Washington Changes Green Card Rules
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that there would be a new U.S. immigration plan that changed Green Card rules.
It envisions reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for temporary work permits, and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed on both sides of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States gives Green Card to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates, those with self-sustaining financial resources and skills that will benefit our economy," the American media quoted Trump as saying.
Writers comment on Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
For two seasons, the enthusiasm and glamour I could not see had been restored to Kadıköy...
A "mangal-hearted" team by Aykut Koca was on the field to make a "stand behind us" deal with his sidekick.
We can bring criticism to your game, positions or performances, but I haven't seen a game that works and calls like this in a long time.
He had shown it in the first game, but yesterday he put his apolets on his shoulder; Fenerbahçe's field commander is now Valbuena.
His age had been a problem when he was transferred, but in the words of Koca, he had the phrase "the character that doesn't give up".
Thirty years ago, we gave the name of the atomic ant to Reza Çalımbay.
If he does, it will be the most appropriate comment for the French player.
He was all over the field, participating in all the pass events, always taking responsibility and scoring a goal, and a giant show on the short neck.
Alper's lead, remaining in the second striker position, left the Sturm Graz team "restricted" in its field for a long time.
Fenerbahçe kept looking for formulas to overcome such a hard wall while closing the circuit without throwing a corner.
They dominate the ball, but they can't produce effective passes in any sort of rival penalty area.
This image may bring a "need a centrphore" comment, but we are faced with the game that hesitates to pass on to Ahmethan, unable to put the only centrphore in position.
Either the team didn't trust the young player or his performance needs to improve a little bit.
After the score was 1-1, they were unable to take advantage of two net opportunities.
It was important for them to pass the tour, but it would make the night even better to stand up as "gol" to this fan who stood up for the players' fight.
There will probably be another 1-2 new transfers by Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbahçe needs number 12...
We are on the verge of a very bright and enjoyable season with this style of play that carries the hearts of those in the stands who are trying to play in the front.
Aykut Huge's machine is setting up its rig, it needs a little more time.
They're in good physical quality.
Game quality will also improve.
You also see very clearly that the confidence of all the football players on the field has increased.
They really need last night's applause for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned.
Just when you think 2017 can't get any weirder, a new report comes out about technological advances in the sex robot industry.
Yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Agency for Responsible Robot Science (FRR) published a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape, and nail type.
Mr. Sharkey said of the release of the new report: "People are laughing at them, but the firms are actually getting a lot of referral and we will see them even more."
Modern sex dolls evolved into robots that had silicone skin that was warm to touch from their inflatable counterparts, specifically human-like responses performed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also personalize their robot to match their own blood by choosing anything from the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type or color.
But with so many robots having "personalities" to make a Stepford Woman look innovative, it becomes even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls evolved into silicon-skinned robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to personalize their own robots based on the character traits they find attractive (e.g. shyness).
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frijit Farrah" and "Wild Wendy" with the "machine" personality that gives the impression of shyness.
True Companion's website exclaims: "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as much as possible."
So you love what you love, you don't love what you don't love, etc.
They also have moods during the day, just like real people.
He can be sleepy, willing to talk, or "in full mode".
There are many disturbing sides to the rise of sex robots: not only do they replace real human relationships, but their highly submissive female personality traits, the rapeous connotations as they approach Frijit Farah are the most suggestive.
On its website, True Companion likens Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If the woman can be a vibrator (that's exactly how it goes in her text), why can't men have Roxxxy as well?" the website states.
However, these sex robots are not just fetishes or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex through subjugation, an optional add-on.
Many men will not naturally have sex robots, and while the FRR has drawn attention to their growing popularity, they are now on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But those who see through the extremes can be highly instructive about the course of the period we are living in.
Many people are not weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
With a president in the White House boasting of sexually assaulting women, it is hardly a coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots emerged at a time when women's rights were threatened worldwide.
The most chilling aspect of The Handmaid's Tale TV series is that it's not depictions of all the details, noose bodies, or carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn't feel like such a big change right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical similarity as possible to real women (of course, in the proportions of porn movie stars) to the extent technologically possible.
Their creators want them to give a human feel when they touch, and to mimic the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personality," robots are clearly unable to represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
They have no activities or past stories, nothing to reveal their independence or break the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they are joyous slaves.
Or as they call it in 2017: concubines.
Attack on U.S. military convoy: There are dead and wounded...
A suicide attack in the Karabakh district of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
The explosion, in which 1 NATO soldier and 3 civilians were killed, revealed that 5 of the wounded were American soldiers in the convoy and 1 were interpreters working with NATO forces.
NATO support forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support) said in an official statement that during a joint patrol mission with the Afghan National Army, the suicide bomber detonated homemade explosives.
The injured personnel were reportedly treated at Bagram Airport American Military Hospital.
The injured are not life-threatening.
Local media say the suicide bomber was a member of the Taliban.
Trump's great talent?
Making Mitt Romney look like a common sense figure
It was the reality of the Trump era that the political divide that polarized U.S. voters divided families on a microscale.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the United States were filled with how to deal with the nightmare of relatives who voted for Trump.
We're all making an effort to blow up our own filtering bubbles.
Less talked about is Trump's power to bring families together.
I'm referring to this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has a broken relationship with the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
He reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Everyone he knows, including his Republican brother, whom Trump has been arguing about politics for decades with being in the White House, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
At the dinner table, of course, this is a good thing; but it seems to me that in a broad context, this carries significant risks.
The left was revived by Trump, but the twisting effect of his presidency created the power to push to the right for all.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are talking about the terrible possibility that one day his strange behavior may no longer be shocking.
There is even a more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who oppose their own standards, and these suddenly seem to be a symbol of logic.
I find myself having nostalgia for the bizarre version of Mitt Romney's madness these days: the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like), both of which, according to Trump, are really very light crimes.
When Trump is gone, he just needs to be sane to assess that the next Republican candidate is making incalculable progress.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels operated by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you could spend in the city if you didn't need caffeine.
The horses are massively large, the fiberglass designs in the central cylinder (all the clowns and animals who make strange faces turned to look fearfully behind their own shoulders) and the squiggling music is extremely tumultuous.
In other words, many stereotypes of a city can be disappointing: the landscapes of tall buildings are getting boring, the horizon line is getting too familiar to create too much excitement, and the reality of the city is not reaching the dream.
It's been thirty-five years, and I still haven't completely overcome the day I discovered that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss country house (the hot bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count) but a large roundabout in North London.
However, the carousel in Central Park is still a strangely magical experience, so much so that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and two women in their 40s can go here and all have a very good time.
If I could grade the carousel, I would give it a full grade, but thankfully no one asked.
On the other hand, this week I was asked to evaluate my transaction "experience" between 1 and 5 stars before passing my credit card on a berth.
It's the same at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and the option to match the note with a 15% tip; for what was purchased from the counter...
The effect of this is not only that it slows down what should be an unbiased transaction, but also that it puts pressure on the server to give personality to an event that is not needed at all.
While the poor woman in Bonmarshe was standing there grinning like an apology, the bored me gave five stars to my experience of giving credit cards to her hand.
When the temperature was over 41 degrees, they wore swimsuits.
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season took place, the public flocked to the beaches of Munzur.
From midday, as the heat cooled down well, the young, children, elderly, women and men, who entered the beaches by the Munzur Tea, tried to avoid the heat by cooling off in icy waters.
Especially in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and the UK, the beaches on the edge of Munzur Tea were flooded because the Tunceli citizens spent their holidays in their homeland instead of in the Aegean or the Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, one of the cool ones at Munzur Beach, stated that she used her preference in favour of Tunceli instead of the western provinces for the holiday, "I didn't want to spend my holiday in the west, it was more right to cool down in Munzur as a family, to stay in our own land."
"Munzur's ice-cold water is nowhere in the world, at these temperatures Munzur cools us down," he said.
Hasan Ulu, who came from Germany, said that they preferred the coast of Munzur Tea in Tunceli rather than the coasts of Cesme or Bodrum, and therefore did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains
This is Pistorius' second time leaving the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital to treat cuts to his wrists, which he said occurred after prison officials fell in his cell.
Pistorius had been convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors to the previous accidental manslaughter decision.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he had killed Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria, firing repeatedly towards a toilet cabin door.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken his girlfriend for someone who went in uninvited during the night hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced that they intend to appeal once again against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they consider to be too light this time.
The National Prosecution Mercii said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be considered this year.
Pistorius, if prosecutors succeed, will face an increase of his sentence to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The first pilgrimage caravan was sent off.
The pilgrim candidates who would go to Saudi Arabia with the organization of the Presidency of Religious Affairs were sent off with prayers and tears at the Atatürk Airport Foreign Lines Departure Terminal.
Prior to the movement of the first pilgrimage caravan, the ceremony at the International Terminal was attended by citizens with close relatives as well as about 200 pilgrim candidates.
On the other hand, Turkish Airlines (THY) distributed roses in the bellows to pilgrim candidates who went to the holy land by scheduled aircraft.
The Hajj caravan in Ankara was sent off from Esanboğa.
The Kafile also included martyrs and veteran relatives who benefited from the practice of "curious pilgrimage for veterans and martyr relatives", which was first implemented this year.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
According to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and quoted by bTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on the grounds of illegal camping.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia on the morning of 1 August.
They were released on the same day as the investigation was already underway.
The foreign ministry informed bTV that the Bulgarians were later left.
The Greek authorities have tightened their control over free camping and are still paying serious penalties to those caught resting in places that have not been reserved for that purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could face penalties.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOEY Hoffman (22) went to Turkey to travel with two friends in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who traveled to Adana and Mersin in the car they rented, disappeared in Silifke on 8 July.
His friends, with whom he had come, informed his family in the Netherlands when Hoffman was unable to reach out despite all the calls.
As police moved to find the missing tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei and Jaimy Gewald went to Adana.
INCLUDED BY THE INVESTIGATIONS
Robin Hoffman, who applied to the police here, issued the missing flyers in Adana and Mersin in order to find his brother.
Robin Hoffman stated that the last time they heard from her brother was on July 8, saying, "We first applied to the police in the Netherlands."
Then two of my friends and I came to Turkey and applied to the police here.
So far, we haven't had any news, and we haven't found any leads.
"Until my brother is found, we will remain in Turkey until a news report is received," he said.
World Second Congratulations to Ayşe Ceren from the minister
At the 2017 Crawler Swimming Youth World Championships in Russia, national athlete Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş was the second in the world above 400 metres of water.
Minister of Youth and Sports Osman Aşkın Bak congratulated Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş who won a silver medal with the message he published.
On the first day of the 2017 Crawler Swimming Youth World Championships in Russia, Ceren Yeşilbaş was the second in the world above 400 metres of water.
Ceren took his place on the second chair with his spectacular performance on the track, where he competed with 8 finalists, while missing the gold medal with only 27 salises.
At 400 metres, Elena Lopatina of Russia won the gold medal with a time of 03.18.73 minutes, while Ceren won the silver medal with a time of 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by 8 men and 8 women athletes in the championship.
His last words were 'I think I'm dying, goodbye mother'.
Among those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which has so far been announced to be 30, he called his mother at the time of the fire, saying, "I don't want to die, Mom, it's not fair."
It was announced that it was the Italian Gloria Trevisan and her lover who said, "Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye."
Dozens of people were unaccounted for following the fire, including 26-year-old Gloria Trevisan and her Italian lover Marco Gottardi, who lived on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, said in a statement that, according to information from British authorities, it was certain that both young people had died.
Expressing that the young people's families are experiencing great pain, the lawyer also asked journalists not to insist on getting an explanation on the matter.
I think I'm dying, bye mom
Lawyer Sandri said Gloria called her mother, Emanuela Trevisan, on her cell phone shortly after the fire broke out, and she was crying when she listened to these last conversations that she recorded.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times during the 2 hours following the fire, which started around 1:00 local time.
Trevisan, who was stated to be calmer in their first conversation, said, "Mom, bad things are happening here, there's a fire."
We're stuck, we can't get out.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be rescued.
"We tried to get out by opening the door, but there was a lot of smoke and the elevator wasn't working either," he was quoted as saying.
The latest words of Gloria Trevisan, whose concern grew in her subsequent calls as the fire grew, were:
Mom, my whole life is passing before my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life ahead of me; it's not fair.
I don't want to die and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I won't be able to embrace you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye mom.
I'm going to heaven now and I'm going to help you from there.
This is the fault of the Italian government.
Gloria Trevisan and her lover Marco Gottardi, both studying architecture, had a hard time getting a job after graduating last year, moving from the Veneto region in the north of the country to London in March.
Gloria Trevisan, who had only been able to find a job in her country with a salary of 300 euros, soon began working in London for a job of .1800 a month (about 2060 euros).
Lawyer Sandri said Gloria Trevisan's family was having a difficult time financially, "Gloria had gone to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people are forced to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government must find a solution to this problem immediately," he said.
Italy's drama that fails to provide jobs for its young
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, expressed his anger, "This is the fault of our government, which forces our young people to flee abroad to find work."
In Italy, the unemployment rate has reached 12 percent, while among young people, the rate has surpassed 40 percent.
As this problem grew, many Italian youths had begun to emigrate to many European countries over the past few years, particularly England.
Last year alone, the number of young people forced to leave Italy due to unemployment exceeded 110,000.
Commenting on the finalization of news of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi's death, the Italian press said it was the drama of a country that did not provide jobs for its young people.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate may alleviate IBH
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable health condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and swelling, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Although patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that develop a resistant bowel.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna said that immune cells patrol the intestines so that germs hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote endurance by maintaining sensitive tissues without harming them.
If the balance shifts too much towards inflammation, it can result from inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have found that a type of immune cell that promotes endurance in mice that carry a specific bacteria in their intestines.
And bacteria need tryptophan, one of the building blocks of the protein, to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have established a link between the bacterium species Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the gut microbiome, and the development of the cell population that promotes resilience.'
Rats with more tryptophan in their diet had more of these immune cells.'
He suggested that if the same thing happens in humans, a diet rich in L. reuteri and tryptophan could improve a more durable, less inflammatory gut environment.
While postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas was working on a type of immune cell that improved endurance, he discovered that a group of experimental mice had such cells, but no other group of the same species, which were kept in a different location, did not.
He suspected that the difference was related to the mice's gut microbiomes, in other words the bacterial, virus, and fungal communities that normally live in the stomach-to-gum canal.
DNA sequencing of the intestines of mice was performed, and it was found that there were six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells, but this was lacking in mice without them.
Because they were cared for in a sterile environment, mice lacking a gut microbiome and not developing this type of immune cell were given L. reuteri and immune cells appeared.
To understand how the bacterium affects the immune system, the researchers raised L. reuteri in the fluid and then transferred small amounts of this fluid to immature immune cells taken from mice that were bacteria-free.
Immune cells have become cells that promote endurance.
The active ingredient turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3-lactic acid, when purified from liquid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's food, the number of cells increased by around 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were reduced by half, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have cells that promote the same endurance as mice, and that most of us have L. reuteria in the stomach-to-brain canal.
It is not known if tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop as in mice, but disorders in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said: "The development of these cells is something we probably want to encourage because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in cases where L. reuteri is present cause this population to spread."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United has signed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
After the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United had a "genius" signed with Nemanja Matic.
The $40 million transfer from Chelsea began with a 2-1 win in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday in United's pre-season match, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira filled the eye with the position of holding forward while attacking forward according to their taste.
However, Matic, who was left out during the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, was severely lacking in match condition and was only able to get it out for 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that this had to be improved before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his genius in the way he thinks...he's thinking about football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready sooner."
While Mourinho began to shape the top 11 for the start of the season, like Matic, his new transfer friends Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also played at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent revealed that Mourinho still wanted three more transfers this week, but insisted that the club had already done three of its four priority transfers, "an extraordinary job".
"Thank you to the club for taking three of the four," he added.
"I'd be happier if they took four out of four, but they made a lot of effort for me."
Last year, 197 people were sent to hospital.
According to Swedish Social Welfare Agency data, the diagnosis of gender dissatisfaction, which was put in one person per hundred thousand people in 2005, rose to 8 per hundred thousand in 2015.
The Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital was transferred to 197 people, mostly children and young people, who were displeased with the sex they were born with in the past year.
Lousise Frisen, a child psychiatrist in the same hospital, stated that the increase could be caused by becoming a more open society, "The openness in the psycho-sexual field, including questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in society."
Gender displeasure disorder is known to have no connection to sexual orientation.
Drug operation in Izmir
Ödemiş County Police Department Anti-Smuggling and Organized Crime Bureau teams conducted an operation on the home of 36-year-old F.T. in Ülker Street, September 3, after a tip-off.
A home search found a delicate scale with 33 extacy pills.
F.T., who jumped off the balcony and tried not to escape, was captured and detained.
It was noted that F.T. would be referred to the courthouse following its proceedings at the police station.
Evkur New Malatyaspor transfers
Evkur Yeni Malatyaspor, one of the new teams of the Super League, tied the winger Turgut Doğan Şahin, who played for Kasımpaşa last season, to their colors.
According to a statement from the yellow-black club, a two-year contract was signed with the 29-year-old winger as part of his transfer work.
"A two-year deal was reached with winger Turgut Doğan Şahin who played for Kasımpaşa.
Good luck to our new Malatyaspor". the statements were used.
The British inventor put a micro chip into his home and car with a hand gesture.
A British inventor, he became the first person in the country to wear a micro-chip so that he could open his front door, access his office, and even operate his car with only one hand gesture.
Steven Northam (33) had the tiny chip transferred between his thumb and his finger, and he is currently offering this service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology by means of his firm BioTeq.
To ensure that the implant procedure could be applied to medical standards, he collaborated with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants, Winchester.
The technology is similar to the microchip transplanted to cats and dogs, and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also make changes to the locks in homes and vehicles, including 300 euros per lock, to be compatible with the chip.
This technology has been plugged into both the house and the BMW Z4 of the man, who is married and has a father, and his car is working while his hands are behind the wheel.
White House Show Costs Thousands to Taxpayers
According to military records released to TIME, the White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter into the south lawn for an organization that highlighted American production last month cost taxpayers up to $24,000.
When the president boarded, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of attention in the organization that introduced American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officers traveled through products produced in all 50 states.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was displayed side by side with a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House War Department requested the helicopter's presence on an individual order (also called FRAGO) just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern grass for the "unusual" organization.
The commander of HMX-1 sent an e-mail to his superior, the Deputy Chief of Naval Aviation, the day before the event, saying, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because it's an unusually high visibility organization."
The message stated that the helicopter would come to the south lawn around 7pm on the morning of July 17, and that it would remain there until the grass was cleared between 6pm and 9pm.
Note added that if exit from the White House was delayed, a second flight crew would be required for return flight due to mission time limitations.
Unit security personnel stood inside while the aircraft was on the ground, while the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event.
From the records supplied to TIME, it is unclear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
Hatch Law prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violated this requirement.
"One question we asked was whether he violated the Hatch Law and it was reported to us that he did not," he wrote.
"It seems you've been locked up," replied the Deputy Commander.
The "Made in America" organization has been designated by the White House as an official organization and is not covered by the Hatch Code.
But even formal organizations have political implications.
In the organization, the president addressed efforts for health care reform, which then continued in the Senate, and praised efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new occurrence.
Presidents need to use these to travel.
But it is unusual for them to be formally requested to be used only for the opportunity to take a photo.
Trump had drawn attention in February when his presidential plane moved behind the scenes of his first campaign rally in Melbourne Florida, and given that his Twitter account's predecessor was full of messages about the use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited by the 'Made in America' exhibition, where products made by American workers from all 50 states are made with American materials," White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said.
The HMX-1 crew frequently conducts training flights in the Washington area and exercises to leave the President of the United States in the south lawn with a dot shot to the White House.
While Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 drill landings at the White House.
An official said that the flight for the Made in America organization counted the air crew's need for training during that month.
Unit helicopters flew for an additional 11 hours that day for "support missions unrelated to the presidency".
The White House said taxpayers were not burdened with any other tricks involved in the organization.
A spokesman for Sikorksky said their firm did not participate in setting up the helicopter's display on the southern lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact expense suffered by the organization is difficult to detect.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense's rate of meeting VH-3D is $24,340 per flight hour.
Unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the base base in Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico Virginia to both sides.
The White House claims that the helicopter's actual operating expenses are well below that.
"It is very misleading to charge taxpayers an expense based on estimates of the cost-to-charge ratio," Walters said.
"These rate estimates cover the sunken costs involved in personnel, maintenance and annual expenses."
According to a 2015 RAND survey, the Department of Defense's cost-to-cost ratios do not include staff costs but include fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, Sean Spicer, a former press spokesman for the White House, advocated the use of the helicopter for this organization.
"The main idea here is to showcase what is being done in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I think that even if there aren't thousands, the work of hundreds depends on it.
And like most Americans, I think we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans work tirelessly to make.
So, of course, it is appropriate to put it forward."
It's unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as it roamed the southern grass for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump joked with the media about company products in his fleet, calling Sikorsky representatives.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."

Narcon Season 3 trailer: Cali Cartel comes to the forefront with Pablo Escobar leaving on Netflix's hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer appeared in season two, Netflix's show doesn't seem to be over.
The third and fourth season has already been confirmed by the online streaming service, with the first receiving its first trailer, giving ideas about the bad characters of the upcoming era.
With the third season, the DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug-trafficking organization: the Cali Cartel
They are run by four powerful mafia fathers and run "like a Fortune 500 company", but with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is the brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages Mexican connections, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is based in New York City.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns to the American and Colombian law enforcement force as Javier Pea, the character who provides support in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will air for the first time on September 1.
According to the B.M., Afghan democracy depends on women's political role.
The head of B.M.'s mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections could be representative if all sections of society, including women, were to play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, vice president of the U.N. Relief Mission, says hundreds of women competed in provincial council elections, three women competed for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," she said in Wednesday's statement.
Elections can be truly representative and reliable if only women are fully involved and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan province council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban made threats against the electoral process, which coincided with the time when international military operations became an advisory mission.
This year's elections mark the peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the strong role of women will contribute to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports 1.2 million women from 3.6 million registered voters.

Trabzonspor football players pass health check
The Bordeaux-blue club's website said that players who will begin preparations for the new season had undergone health checks.
The statement stressed that football players were subjected to a variety of tests as part of the health control carried out in a private hospital, stating: "Our players had internal, cardiology, eye, orthopedics, general surgery, neurology, and ear and nose throat checks."
In addition to laboratory, radiology and cardiology examinations, footballers also took an echo exertion test.
Their mother went shopping, two children died in a fire
According to the information obtained, women named Sevgi Karakan and Güneş Yapal in Sayyazı Mahallesi went shopping in the market.
Sevgi Karakan left the house leaving his 3-year-old child Hasan Umut Karakan and Sun Yapal 9-year-old son Aykut Yapal, his 4-year-old child Durdu Yapal to his 18-year-old daughter Ümmühan Yapal.
After a while, a fire broke out in the house for a reason not yet known.
Unable to interfere with the fire, Ummuhan Yapal went outside the house and passed out.
Citizens in the surrounding area immediately notified the Mersin Metropolitan Municipality Firefighters.
Fire crews who arrived at the scene and worked to put it out inside the house found the body of Hasan Umut Karakan, 3, and Durdu Yapal, 4 years old.
During the fire, 9-year-old Aykut Yapal was found not at home because he went to the grocery store.
Families of the children who died had nervous breakdowns at the scene, while police launched a wide-ranging investigation into the incident.
McVitie's GMB concern over investment in Glasgow factory
A union seeks assurances from the executives of biscuit maker McVitie's that a long-term commitment to production at his factory in Glasgow will be made.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross region.
Among other products, more than 500 people work at the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits are produced.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, said they have invested more than 5 million pounds in the region over the past few years.
He added that if there is a change in their operations, employees and union representatives will be "first informed".
In a letter to the company's plant manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to "fix concerns that there is no funding for modernisation of production bands".
Drew Duffy, GMB senior organiser, said: "The failure to see a clarity on business needs and the investment plan for Tollcross's future is deeply worrying to our members.
Generations of families work here, and the workforce is concentrated heavily in the local community and in Glasgow and its suburbs, the criticalstay of adequate employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
From a business, salary, and welfare perspective, Brexit conditions, against rising living costs and chronic production decline, urgently need a four-headed crop production presence at Glasgow's eastern end, McVitie's."
A female spokesperson from Pladis said: "GMB, the plant manager in Tollcross, received a letter yesterday from Scotland and the company will respond directly because we value our commitment to union representatives with workers.
Two months ago at Tollcross, with employees and GMB representatives, we had a regular meeting where several questions were openly discussed.
We then told our employees that, like all companies that do business in an overly competitive and uncertain economic environment, we are constantly reviewing our operations to stay competitive, which applies to all our jobs and facilities.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross facility, especially production bands and operational improvements.
We fully recognize Tollcross's legacy as a manufacturing facility, and in the event of any changes to our operations at the facility, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Necip and Utku in Beşiktaş for another 4 years
Beşiktaş Club extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvkuran for 4 years.
In the section on the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), which includes data on footballers, Beşiktaş was seen to have extended the contract with two players until 31 May 2021.
Growing up in the black-and-white team's infrastructure and making its first professional contract on June 19, 2008, Necip began to play for the A team in the 2009-2010 season.
The 1991-born player, who had risen to team captain, played in a total of 254 official matches with Beşiktaş.
The TFF website also included information that Beşiktaş signed a contract with him until 31 May 2021, when he received a testimonial of goalkeeper Utku Yuvakuran, whom he included on loan last season.
Utku was removed from temporary transfer status as of 1 August 2017, and his license was renewed on 2 August.
Utku Yuvkuran served mainly in games in the Under-21 League in Beşiktaş, where he played for hire last season.
The young goalkeeper took part in only 2 Turkish Cup matches with the black-and-white jersey.
Has PSG warned Barcelona of Neymar's departure 3 years ago?
La Liga side may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up his pursuit of Neymar after he submitted the offer to mobilise the 189 million-euro release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of world record looting three years ago?
With the Ligue 1 team ready to break the world transfer record for more than double the previous amount when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season, for a fee of $89 million, the sensational bid moved the summer transfer period.
With PSG proposing a weekly salary of $500,000 after taxes, it shows that Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world when the transfer is completed, and also the most profitable professional athlete.
Although a source close to the Catalans' rule insists that the club has always done its best to keep an eye on him from his arrival in 2013, Barcelona is known to be angry about the style of the proposal and Neymar's attempt to leave.
So, was the football world warned by the PSG president about this landscape three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuidi signing in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to all clubs who wanted to sign one of PSG's top players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be against them, we'll get in touch with their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
