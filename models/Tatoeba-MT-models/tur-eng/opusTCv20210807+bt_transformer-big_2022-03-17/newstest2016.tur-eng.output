Professor Admits He Killed His Girlfriend by Calling 911
University Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told police that he shot his girlfriend with a gun, and the police said that the houses should come, only slightly shakyly.
Lamb stated that his "cute dog" was alive and possibly upset, and that the phones of the deceased woman's parents could be found on the woman's cell phone.
Police found Amy Prentiss's lifeless body at home and a handwritten note in a white notebook: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could turn everything around, I loved Amy so much, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," the officers stated that Lamb had signed the note.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who had taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school campus, where police believe beloved history professor Ethan Scmidt was shot and killed in front of his office by Lamb.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard shots at 10:18 p.m.
Lamb's grave 911 call was also made shortly after that, he said.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as police approached him.
The day after the school shooting caused students and professors to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still investigating what drove Lamb to do so.
The details of the investigators on both sides of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, drew a picture of a talented but possibly problematic teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to taking his class.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, stated that Lamb had no criminal or criminal record.
Schmidt even mentioned Lamb in a book as one of the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members were listed, and many students took lessons from both.
However, there were also signs that there were spiritual problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who spoke highly of Lamb, said he was also an anxious and nervous person and "looked like he had a problem".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, stated that Lamb had told him that he was struggling with stress in late 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for sick leave, stating that he had some health problems.
This year he only taught two classes online.
Recent changes to the University's hiring policies could not automatically guarantee that Lamb would become a tenured faculty member, despite his Ph.D. degree, where he worked hard to win.
University Dean William LaForge stated that he did not know that there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "it was obvious that Lamb had something in mind."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After the campus was evacuated, police tracked Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Forensic Investigation Director Methel Johnson announced that his family committed suicide with a single .38-caliber gun before Lamb could be arrested in the backyard of a house about a mile from his home in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi.
Lamb's car was found running on the highway.
Although it was not immediately determined why Lamb went to this house, Johnson stated that he believed Lamb knew the inhabitants of this house.
Lamb had grown up in this area.
Lamb began working at the city's 3,500-student university of about 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 and was teaching geography and education.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic, and fun.
When Carla Hairston met through her mutual friends, she said she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a big, nice guy who tried to teach guitar for a few years.
At the time, he was the one who made hearts beat fast.
Hairston, now 40 years old and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon City, said of Lamb, "All the girls melted when he arrived."
Lamb and Prentiss had obviously been together for some time.
On the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no official record of them getting married.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in brick houses on the banks of a river in Gautier.
Police said the dog was in good condition.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said that they divorced 15 years ago, but that he and Prentiss had always been friends, and that they now have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also stated that his daughter was completely devastated.
She and her mother were great friends.
He said he had never met O'Steen Lamb, but heard Lamb play blues from his daughter Abigail, who was interested in music.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail were performing at a summer festival.
Lamb and Abigail then played together in the general demonstrations.
O'Steen stated that his daughter wrote and sang her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a variety of online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Jeep Room, a dim bar near Gautier, said Lamb and Prentiss were last seen on the night of September 5 after Lamb had finished playing guitar and harmonica to a small number of spectators.
There was no sign of a problem.
He said they were a pretty happy couple.
Sometimes we were cutting and throwing a line at each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the same university, stated that the murdered professor Schmidt directed the seminar program for freshmen and was an expert on Native Americans and colonial history.
He was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was also the president of a student solidarity group he founded himself.
On Tuesday night, about 900 people attended a candle-planting ceremony on the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, including academics, university employees, students, and visitors from the local community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and her brother Jeff Schmidt attended the memorial service, where the college choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Great Fortune".
Classes continue on Wednesday.
"We are trying to bring our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to heal the wounds.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (in Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (in New Orleans) contributed to this story.
This news text was corrected to reflect this when police stated that Lamb had called 911 after killing Schmidt, and there was no official evidence that the two were married, although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his "wife" on the 911 call.
Toys R Us Plans to Get Less Holiday Season Element
Toys R Us announced this year that it will not hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products manufacturer said the firm would allow more work for its current employees and seasonal workers.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, with 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work will be part-time.
The company said interviews with candidates would begin later this month and the number of staff would increase from October to December.
Even though the holiday season is still months away, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees who will equip their stores and help them sell, ship and distribute products.
Michael J. Fox made jokes about "relationship" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a crucial moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also very important for personal reasons.
She describes this in the trailer for the documentary Back in Time, which is set to be released: "We were sitting in the theater waiting for members of the Royal Family to arrive, and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and I knew Princess Diana would sit next to me.
The film began, and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was a false stretch and arm stretch away from me.
A documentary about the film "Back to the Future", Back in Time features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future was first released 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time travel film ever made for me."
It will be shown in Back in Time VOD and DVD formats, as well as in some select cinemas.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
On Russia's growing military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the nearly five-year-long Syrian problem "cannot be solved by military intervention" and that more weapons would only be more violence and pain for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also invited all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together and hold constructive talks in order to find a political solution to the problem.
At a press conference on Wednesday, the UN General Assembly meeting to be held towards the end of the month, five permanent council members, the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France, said they planned to meet with foreign ministers in Syria.
He said he was deeply saddened that the division between the council members and the Syrian people "made the problem insoluble" by the regional powers.
Ban has invited five permanent members to join forces in the Syrian crisis, as in the Iran nuclear deal.
8 Poll Figures That Show Donald Trump Is Serious
Some tried to label him as a volcano.
The others threw it at him like it was a joke.
And some support the internal explosion.
Although some Republicans have tried to pull Donald Trump down in the polls, this (yet) has not worked.
Of the 11 most recent national polls, he cited Donald Trump's leadership in double digits, and some are beginning to seriously ask about the real estate emperor's chances of running.
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
None of this means Trump can win the Republican candidate race.
Experts state that the rise of Rick Perry during these periods in 2011 also caused the rise for Herman Cain, both of whom failed to win the nomination process even in a single state.
And there are many reasons why he will have trouble in the general election as well.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC group and the Economic conservative group, the Growth Club, are realizing Trump's enduring power and are beginning to spend their dollars to bring him down.
Here are some recent poll results that show that the real estate emperor is not just coming and going:
Trump's preference rates have changed by 180 degrees.
A poll conducted at Monmouth University just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June showed that two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion for the real estate emperor.
By mid-July, that number was 40 percent.
It was 52 percent in early August.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are high in the early stages.
Last week, a poll in Quinnipiac, Iowa showed that 60 percent of Republicans there preferred Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters may be satisfied with the Trump nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump ran.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "sad" if he ran.
Only Ben Carson creates the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% said they would be "enthusiastic", compared to 40% for Trump).
The other person closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would "not be pleased" or "sad" if Jeb Bush, the institution's favorite, ran.
The majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
Donald Trump has been criticized for his flamboyant language and insults, while Monday's ABC News/Washington Post polls show that 52 percent of Republicans who have been asked the question think the real estate emperor has the right temperament to be president.
The same figure applies in Iowa, where the country's first party convention will be held, where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to lead, according to Quinnipac last week.
Still 44 percent feel that he does not have the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six out of 10 independents say his temperament does not fit the White House.
Republican voters are beginning to get used to the idea.
When they wear their political expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
A CNN/ORC poll last week found that when asked who was the best candidate to win the GOP nomination, four out of every 10 said Trump was the best.
A shift since the end of July, when four out of 10 people invested their money in Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal sphere of GOP voters was not very clear.
During the last election cycle at the time, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would run, while only 28 percent ultimately chose Mitt Romney.
Still, the majority of GOP voters seem to find Trump's election campaign plausible.
Even if Republicans rally around another candidate, Trump is still beating almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the scattered area may also contribute to Trump's prominence, and it is also true that anti-Trump support is scattered among more than a dozen candidates.
However, a Monmouth University poll conducted in early September shows that in the event of a head-to-head possible match between Trump and many Republican candidates, Trump had the support of a majority each time.
Carly passes Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
A draw with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
In case of a possible coping situation, Ben Carson beats the businessman by 19 points.
The vast majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they have made their decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll, published on Tuesday, shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked their vote.
Frankly, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say that they're not going to change their mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to change candidates.
Still Trump's biggest rival is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've made their decision are twice as close to voting for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rape" in his campaign ad address two months ago, the issue at the beginning and center of the 2016 talks has been immigration.
Some think that Trump's much-talked talk drove key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and would damage their rebranding efforts.
However, according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration-related issues.
So as long as immigration remains on the agenda, Trump seems to remain on the agenda.
Anger at the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson roughly get half of the Republican vote due to their largely external situation.
In Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they want someone outside rather than someone with government experience.
And they're mad at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa were angry with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were "unsatisfied" and 21 percent were "extremely angry".
In Prime Minister's Questions, Jeremy Corbyn will be on the stand for the first time.
Since the day he was elected, Mr. Corbyn has been eagerly expected to appear on the bench in the Questions to the Prime Minister program.
Jeremy Corbyn, the new Labour leader, will stand for the Prime Minister's Questions after David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will ask six questions shortly after noon, and his performance seems to be closely studied by the media and Labour MPs.
He called for "less theatre and more truth" in the weekly show.
He also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to his colleagues.
This encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbyn's leadership, following his appointment of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the TUC annual convention on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's silence during the reading of the national anthem at the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the British War on Tuesday has also been criticised by some Tory MPs, and is the focus of front-page news in newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to accompany the national anthem was noted.
Speaking on behalf of Mr. Corbyn, a spokesman said he stood in a "respectable silence" and appreciated the "royalty of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England".
However, Owen Smith, one of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet members, told BBC Two's News Night program that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independently" from his belief in the abolition of the monarchy.
Less than a sixth of those in the parliamentary party supported him as a leader, while nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's senior team due to differences in economics, defense and foreign relations.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant notes that policy differences within the Labour Party are also beginning to be "stacked" and these are issues of Mr. Corbyn's appointment over the position in the European Union and the government's upper limit on aid.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party had introduced new changes in the way of removing the upper limit altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said the party was only against the government's reduction of the upper limit of 26,000 euros to 23,000 euros, and was "very clear" about it.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet on the public chamber bench from the time he became the Conservative Party leader.
The Labour leader promised a different approach to politics and said he had received "public-sourced" and over 30,000 recommendations to ask Mr Cameron.
The Islington North MP told the Prime Minister that the Questions program was very confrontational and would focus on poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people, rather than exchanging sarcasm with "answer-raising."
Mr. Corbyn told the Prime Minister that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade minister, would represent her in the Questions program when she was not there, for example, when Mr. Cameron went on a trip abroad.
He even occasionally suggested the idea that his other colleagues would take the stand, and he also told Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow that he had applied to address the issue.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron often expressed his desire to move away from politics in the "Puppet Game" style associated with the Questions program to the Prime Minister, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in this regard.
Since its first publication in 1990, the Questions to the Prime Minister program has been used as a fundamental measurement point to measure leaders' ability to make decisions, their dominance in the House of Commons, and their position among MPs; in contrast, some critics have expressed that it has been caricatured and that extensive reforms are needed.
'Pushed in Joburg': Homeless teens study photography
Johannesburg city centre is a tough place for the homeless.
However, a group of old street kids found a way to gain a new talent and make a living.
I was shot in Joburg, a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth to take pictures of their neighborhood and make income from it.
BBC News went to meet one of the project's first graduates.

Pound rises as wage increases in the United Kingdom accelerate
Following data showing an increase in wages in the United Kingdom, the pound saw a rapid rise, while the FTSE 100 index rose following a purchase offer for SABMiller.
Prices in the United Kingdom, excluding premiums, increased by 2.9% between May and July compared to the same period of the previous year.
This rate, which represents the fastest increase since 2009, is also seen as one of the leading indicators for possible interest increases.
The sterling gained more than 1% value against the US dollar, rising to $1,5505, and 0.84% against the euro, rising to $1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index increased by 1.49 percent to 6.229.21 points.
The most prominent company on this rise was SABMiller, which recorded a 20% increase with an attractive purchase offer from its rival EU InBev.
This offer will merge the two largest breweries in the world, and well-known brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will meet under the same roof.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% due to positive profit news from rival luxury retailing group Richemont.
Richemont's current sales figures also showed that sales began to rise again in China, one of the key markets for Burberry, as well as exceeding expectations.
Mining giant Glencore's shares rose 5% after the company announced it had raised $2.5 billion from its allocation share sale as part of its strategy to reduce debt.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were among the most deprecated, with a 4.3% loss of value following Goldman Sachs's reduction of its proposal for the company to "Sat".
JD Sports's stake rose 3.1% after the company announced that its six-month pre-tax profit had risen by 83% to 46.6 million pounds.
JD Sports boss says higher salaries could hurt expansion
Peter Cowgill, Chairman of JD Sports, said that the higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers".
However, he said that this spending power could not exceed the high employee costs at his own company.
He added that the costs would affect JD Sports' expansion plans, which could mean less extra work.
Metcash launches public campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market wholesaler Metcash launched a public campaign to defend retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against the $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, and the first of its stores with numbers to reach 120, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationship with local food suppliers, and are trying to create the IGA brand with mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide fair.
IGA pesters and suppliers also contribute with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo, which offers flavor testing at IGA stores, and with store owners who sell South Australian football league tickets to their loyal customers at a discount.
Food, drink and hardware wholesaler Metcash is expected to offer more details on its defence strategy as it improves its annual investor strategy day on September 29.
The risk is large, as South Australia and Western Australia represent almost 30% of Metcash's IGA store footprint, generating higher profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
South Australian and Western Australian store owners are negatively shortsighted and enjoy a much stronger market share than IGA retailers have achieved in NSW, Victoria, and Queensland; 30% more in GA and 24% more in BA than in Eastern states.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will capture about 5% of the market in the 12 months after opening its first stores in these two states, taking sales away from current players but generally unstuck retailers.
In a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers would lose $360 million in one year and Metcash would lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This estimate is based on Aldi's forecast that he will open 25 stores in the GA next year and 30 in the BA, with $500 million and $600 million in sales in each market.
Mr. Kierath said the loss of food and grocery sales and Metcash's high fixed cost base volumes could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and tax.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in eastern states, primarily Aldi and Coles, despite recent Roy Morgan research that reveals IGA customers are the most loyal customers.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's food and grocery sales will decrease by y3.8 in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, which will reduce its market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder, lead fund manager Hamish Douglass, said at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash could "probably be deleted in a decade".
Metcash refused to respond to Mr. Douglass' comments.
However, it appears that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has declined from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash's earnings from the food and grocery business, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have dropped 43% since 2012, an indication that the business leverage rate has declined as sales and margins have come under pressure.
However, the wholesaler resists, investing more than $150 million a year in Coles and Woolworths for matching shelf prices on the hundredth of products each week, helping IGA retailers to renovate their stores, adding faster growing fresh foods, and bringing a better line of private-label markets to the public.
Ian Morrice, chairman of the Metcash executive board, says that price matching and store renewal programs have begun to yield results, and the wholesaler is expected to return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more credit for his behavior than criticism.
According to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis was on the side that was accidentally damaged in the last storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and deserves more credit than criticism.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented duo, normally referred to as the "Special K's", found himself under spot lights that did not welcome Kyrgios' Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters due to his flamboyant paste.
In a difficult afternoon qualifying match at Cincinnati, as Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison were separated twice by the file referee, Harrison announced: "Wawrinka came on Kyrgios, and I have to go on that boy."
Kokkinakis, who was last seen at the US Open potentially breaking his racket in a way that upsets Richard Gasquet, was faithfully defended by Healy.
The young player is currently competing in the Davis Cup semi-final with Sam Groth in Glasgow for the second singles role behind Bernard Tomic against Britain.
Healy said, "What I feel quite enthusiastically is that I think that Thanasi is being drawn to the debate."
He broke his racket in the United States when he closed and lost, but he's not the first player to break a racquet because he's disappointed with himself, and I know Thanasi is aware enough that he shouldn't be proud of it.
But in reality, in the United States, he handled himself quite well under highly provocative circumstances with Harrison and others, and I think he deserves a lot of praise.
He's got a great team around him, a great family, and I think he's gone a little too far.
Although he is 19 years old, he is extremely mature, hard working, and adapts to the team, he has no problems with other players, he is well respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is a highly balanced and mature young man, and in my opinion he deserves to be judged on his own criteria.
Healy also supported Kyrgios' decision to welcome Kyrgios for the important draw; from Friday, he began to explain that what was right for everyone from now on was "to make a mutual decision" but to support Canberran so that he would return to the team as a long-term fixture.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match, not the strife around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And in my opinion, as people like Nick, Federer, and Murray have pointed out, the boy has risen too fast, he's grown up in front of the public, and he's made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he's not under the spotlight, he thinks deeply that my thinking is appropriate, that it's best for the team and for himself.
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, declaring a state of emergency for the purpose of cutting the flow of migrants, and detaining those trying to enter the country illegally.
With hundreds of migrants piled up in neutral territory, create chaos on the border, and Serbian officials acted in anger.
Migrants fleeing violence in their own countries set up tents by the road for an indefinite period between the two countries' checkpoints and settled in these tents.
However, their anger was increasing.
As a police helicopter passed above, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and hurled insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Others rejected the water and food given to them as protests.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that Hungary's repatriation of migrants was "unacceptable" as the influx of migrants from Macedonia and Greece continued.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not be harmed by the process.
In the coming days, talks with Brussels and other countries will need to be held," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
This tension on the Hungarian-Serbia border occurred just a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 migrants who almost attacked Greece and Italy, and expressed hope that by the end of next month or year there would be an agreement to accept 120,000 more migrants, including those from Hungary, into EU countries.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an EU summit next week to discuss this migrant crisis facing the continent on Tuesday.
Hungary, on the other hand, is not hopeful that Brussels or its neighbours will take any concrete steps on the issue.
The call for an emergency on Tuesday in the two southern regions gives authorities broad powers to combat the crisis, including closing roads where necessary and speeding up cases related to asylum seekers.
On the other hand, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country plans to draw barbed wire along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants from this country after the barbed wire it pulled across the border with Serbia.
CBS News reporter Charlie D'Agata announced that even prisoners in prisons have been assigned to work barbed wire drawing between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become an important narrow passage and crossing point to European Union countries, with many of these migrants fleeing wars in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, on the other hand, insists that the vast majority of incoming immigrants are "economically motivated immigrants" who are trying to move to Europe for a better life rather than innocent people coming to escape the war - the idea is completely opposite to the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
Laws enacted at midnight in Hungary impose more severe penalties on human traffickers, as well as making it a crime to cross or damage a four-metre (13 feet) long barbed wire drawn to the Serbian border.
In a statement to reporters in the southern city of Szeged, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "The Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency because of the situation caused by mass immigration".
Our opinion on one thing is clear: it is a crime to cross the border illegally.
Although troop deployment still needs to be approved by parliament, Associated Press reporters in the area say they have seen dogs and men with vehicles armed with heavy weapons for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic security adviser, said authorities had crossed the border with 45 people trying to cross the border and captured 15 people who had entered the country.
They passed by damaging barbed wire, now in police custody and charged with felony under new law.
Authorities are quickly repairing barbed wire.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia on Tuesday morning, while using a train car covered with barbed wire to close one of the crossings.
The chaos was reflected in the main border crossing point near Roszke, as Hungarians put in place a small metal container where people were packed in to make the transactions.
Twenty people were able to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of immigrants said they would not accept food and water assistance until they were allowed to enter Hungary by blocking the highway connecting Serbia with Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's supremacy over Bernie Sanders halved in national election
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues her two-figure lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Sen. Bernie Sanders catches up with her.
Clinton currently holds second place with 27% (up from 17%), with 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is in the presidential race, receives 15% of the democratic vote.
In more than five months before the start of the main races, most Democratic voters said it was too early to decide which candidate to support.
Clinton's supporters, however, have more solid ideas about their own elections than any other candidate.
Since last month's CBS News, Clinton has been losing ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has some gains.
Clinton leads by a big margin between women and moderates, but that gap is closing.
His support among men has dropped drastically, and Sanders only follows him from behind by 5 points.
Clinton's Democratic voter advantage under the age of 50 has evaporated, and he and Sanders are now on par.
Clinton, however, leads the right by a huge margin in terms of older voters.
Last month, Clinton was moving ahead of Sander with two-digit steps among the liberals, but now Sanders is 5 points ahead of this group.
At the national level, about half of the democratic voters say they will passionately support Clinton if he is the party's candidate.
One quarter would support it on some conditions, while another 15 percent would only support it if it ran.
Six percent do not support Clinton.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters tend to passionately support him.
Opinions between those who do not currently support Clinton are even more mixed - only a quarter can passionately support him.
48% of Democrats passionately say they will support Clinton, while less Republican frontrunners talk about Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked open-ended questions about why they want Clinton to run, the top answers are that she has the right experience (16%), the idea that it's time to elect a female president (13%), and that she's the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also voice his relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Negotiating issues and selectability are also among the criteria outlined.
As a vice president with potential for president, 57 percent of Democratic voters might want to see him in the race, but that's not how a third of the electorate thinks.
When Demoktrat voters are asked what their second candidate election is for the party, Biden is in the top spot.
According to Sander, more than half of Clinton's supporters say Biden could have been their second choice by a wide margin.
If Biden does not enter the Democratic Nomination race, Hillary Clinton's superiority over Sanders increases; her level, 20 points in a race with Biden, rises to 30 points in a race without Biden.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning a general election; however, this figure fell from 78 percent last month to this level.
Biden was second in this regard, though he was a long way behind, but the percentage of those who saw him as the most eligible candidate increased.
Again, when asked what the most important thing in a candidate is, Democratic voters put issues ahead of selectability.
Similar to last month, no Democratic voter candidate or candidate seems to be considered a candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or candidates perform well in some of the main characteristics among the primary voters of their respective parties.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy, as well as people with strong leadership qualities.
While Biden is ranked first among the three in terms of honesty, Clinton is strong on leadership.
According to thirty percent of Democratic voters, Clinton is dishonest and unreliable, with half of them saying the same for Sanders (15 percent), while 27 percent have no idea about it.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden in line with their ideology.
In all measures, a quarter of Democratic voters have no idea about Sanders.
While questions remain regarding his personal email address and use of his server during his tenure as State Department, most Democratic voters find the statement to be satisfactory and state that their views on him are not affected.
But it's a different story in the general American public.
While half of Americans are no longer satisfied with his statements, only a third find them satisfactory.
The public's views on this matter were split in March, shortly after the problem was taken under the lens.
Most Americans say that email contentions do not affect their general opinion of Clinton, on the other hand, their negative opinion has increased by 36 percent.
These are Republicans in general, and more than six in 10 say their views on Clinton have been broken.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by voters of his own party, among registered voters, this issue is still a problem in general: only 32% saw him as honest and trustworthy, while the figure dropped eight points from last month and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't find him honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not find Trump honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump score well on leadership.
Out of the six candidates who took the test, Biden, Carson, and Bush scored best on honesty.
More often than not, he finds Sanders to be honest, but as with Carson, most of them don't have an opinion of him.
The margin of error in samples from 351 Democratic voters is 6%.
Ben Carson is just behind Donald Trump in national polls
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson runs close behind Donald Trump.
The new poll shows that about half of the two candidates' voters corresponded to the vote, while the other candidates did not have much chance.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, with support for 23% in the latest CBS poll before last month's debate on Fox News climbing to 27% in the poll announced on Tuesday.
However, support for Carson rose from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The poll also found Carson was doing well in demographic groups, with support among college-educated Republican voters much higher than Trump.
The remainder have now dropped to 2% from last month's 10 percent support with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
This latest poll, with 376 people elected from the Republican electorate, had a margin of error of 6% and the poll was held in September.
Last CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson's support among Republicans at 19%, just behind Trump's support of 32%.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump in front of Carson in earnest.
Faced with Carson's rise last week, Trump apologized for questioning Carson Trump's faith, but continued to wave randomly at the retired neurosurgeon.
At a campaign stop in Iowa, Trump said last Saturday that "we need energy."
Five fraternity members accused of the death of Baruch College freshman
During the initiation of a fraternity in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, murder cases were filed against five people almost two years after the death of a college student.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity attacked Chun "Michael" Deng harshly at a start-up ceremony in September 2013, and according to police, he contributed to his death by delaying taking her to the hospital.
Authorities reported that he was blindfolded, stuck on the back of a backpack filled with 30 pounds of sand, and constantly tripped as he tried to walk towards the target on a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained over time that his head hurt and then he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and according to police, they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
However, according to Police Commissioner Chris Wagner, who spoke at a press conference, they changed Deng's clothes, searched Google for his symptoms, and contacted the brother's national president, Andy Meng, asking for advice.
At this point, members began to hide personal items and put the good of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng, Commissioner Wagner said.
He was not revived and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was traumatized by repeated blows to his head, torso, and hip with an unsharp object.
In a statement, Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said that many families were destroyed as a result of Brotherhood initiations, with at least one student dying each year since 1970.
The Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable for this, and this step by the authorities is crucial.
The Monroe Town grand jury recommended that a third-degree murder charge be filed for the first five members.
Thirty-two fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with the initiation of the attack and criminal conspiracy.
At a press conference on Tuesday, Wagner said, "We will hold not only those involved, but also those responsible if there is an organization that officially or informally affirms it."
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity ended its relationship with this local unit.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rates?
With interest rates rising, the bull market is upside down, with bond revenues climbing, and the economy recording a decline.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take and how long it's going to last.
History, especially in economics, offers little information on timing.
The decline has taken as long as 86 months, as it took as little as 11 months after the initial interest rate increase.
The U.S. Central Bank Fed's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often been decisive in the response of the economy and financial assets, if not continuous.
That is why U.S. central bank officials strongly stress that investors should not focus on when interest starts to increase, but on how long the normalization process takes.
It's a fact that there are various variables.
However, the result is that market participants may think that the rate hike rush has been exaggerated.
Capital Economics Global Chief Economist Julian Jessop said in a note to customers, "It is inevitable that since the global financial crisis, the Fed's initial interest hike has been interpreted by some as signaling the end of the 'cheap money' era."
On the contrary, we do not expect U.S. interest rates to gradually return to normal, but it appears to be the seismic blow that most of the levels that are still low are afraid of.
Still, we can't say it won't have effects.
Based on past trends, the response that some areas of the economy can have is as follows:
As the market has seen over the past months, waiting for interest rates to increase can destabilize things for a while.
When interest is increased, the effect is not so obvious.
In a new study of what will happen after the Fed increases, Deutsche Bank analysts said, "The equity returns appear to be a 12-24 month stall trend after the initial interest hike, which may reflect a pause in monetary policy."
According to a recent analysis by Nuveen Asset Management analyst Bob Doll, the market has generally seen sharp increases over the last 35 years, with an average return of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles after 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 per cent) and 500 days after returning to normal.
Deutsche said that the impact on the shares has become more pronounced in the later stages of the interest-raising cycle, and that the return is facing extinction.
Regressions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases also help them.
The Fed faces some situations in the current situation that have not existed before and that will accelerate the decline.
The most notable is that the gross domestic product is at the lowest level to date for the Fed interest hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 interest rate increase since 1950, the nominal year-to-year gross domestic product has dropped only two times below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 took place at 3.6 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed, this is expected by very few to be permanent, with the third quarter watching at 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, increasing interest rates in such a sensitive economic environment can be risky and lead to the question "will it be different this time?"
The attention of market participants, who have been waiting for the Fed's interest hike for a year, is this week at a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends Thursday.
While most strategists and economists believe the FOMC can approve an increase in this meeting, futures trading only points to a 25 percent likelihood.
"In our research since 1950, all the incremental cycles that have taken place to date are in a super-rising trend cycle, rapidly reaching pre-regression peaks following the recovery that began with the gross domestic product," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a recovery of unprecedented slowness from the worst setback that took place in an exemplary period.
The current cycle was the longest the Fed has expected since the last setback - the longest loop on record has been 35 months, and the cycle we are in is still in its 74th month.
With the expectation of an interest increase in the market, the fixed income has also become destabilized, and the order is somewhat similar to that of equity.
The main difference is that when the Fed policy changes its course, the impact is seen faster in bonds than in stocks.
When the first increase/fall of the cycle comes, bond returns do not immediately change direction.
At the end of the interest increase cycle, bond returns fall instantly," Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab strategists, increases in interest will bring the yields between longer and shorter-term bonds closer, smoothing the slope.
We, Kathy Jones, one of Schwab analysts, said in the analysis that high yield bonds often perform better in such an environment, but "we are still careful about achieving the yield."
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adapting to the Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the decline in dollar strength and inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market is regulated according to stricter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is smooth, credit spreads have expanded, and the surge has increased - all features to be seen in the market when the Fed tightens policy.
From a broad perspective, companies that do most of their jobs in the U.S. will win because interest rates will increase and local products will be more attractive.
The situation of multinational companies with a lot of debt will be worse, as increasing dollar products will make them more expensive in the global market, and their debt will be even more expensive.
Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for their customers, "History shows that 'quality' stocks may experience a performance low at the beginning of such an increase."
Companies with strong balance sheets surpassed those with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percent following the 1994, 1999 and 2004 rate increases.
Companies with high capital yields and low fluctuating stocks also outperformed their low-quality competitors (percent) by 4 (percent) by 3 averages.
Debt will become a major issue.
According to Goldman, companies with a high rate of fluctuating currency debt are the most likely to suffer.
Apart from the Safi stock market game, consumers are also projected to benefit from the increased dollar.
Although experts have differing opinions on how fast it will hold, savers can also profit from high gains.
Andrew Bingham said a copy of BBC Radio 3 Classic FM
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses station of being 'too much'
He argued that radio was becoming increasingly no different from its commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and accused him of ripping off the Brit Awards.
His proxy friend Damien Collins accused The Voice of not being original
A prominent deputy pressed the publisher to reveal his difference to other commercial stations, saying that BBC Radio 3 was increasingly "transforming" into Classic FM.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said that the radio station, which provides public service to BBC bosses, is "too much" and is increasingly no different from its commercial rivals.
"I don't like to use that phrase, but Radio 3 is becoming more and more Classic FM," he said.
In addition, the first one also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which were held last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, are another version of the Brit Awards.
Bingham said, "So if you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples that come to my mind, whereas you're holding and copying the same thing that already exists in the market."
The BBC's general manager denied the accusations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was clearly ahead of its commercial rivals in both live music and public education.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to go and learn anything about classical music from somewhere else.
And that's commitment to live music, and making music is nothing compared to anything else.
He also said that I think Radio 3's effort to explore new music and promote work is very important.
Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, claimed earlier this year that in order to reach more audiences, the radio would have to work harder than in the past because the British were less educated in classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only component of the BBC held at a meeting of the Cultural, Media and Sports selection committee because it stepped on the tail of its commercial rivals.
MP Tory Damien Collins also sold to O Ses - a music talent contest in which the BBC received royalties from Dutch production company Talpa Media for 22 million pounds.
Can't you see why the program makes so much noise, because it's not original and there's no special difference?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which was a jury of Paloma Faith and Boy George, had been conducted "in a BBC-specific style".
He said he wished the agency would "find a hit of its own blood" before making another entertainment show.
However, he did not accept the idea of preventing the construction of more O Sound programs in the future, or of spending the amount spent on the license fee on other formats.
Is Black Friday the reason why internet sales experienced the lowest increase in history in August?
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in internet sales.
Last month was the lowest growth since 2000, when records began to break.
Three years before mobile devices began to be used in shopping, there was an explosion in internet sales.
Experts say that Black Friday in November could be the reason for cutting spending
Online shopping has been booming for over a decade, turning Britain's most vibrant shopping streets into ghost towns.
After figures showing only a seven percent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say that internet sales are increasingly signaling weakening.
In August, the total expenditure amounted to only a five-percent increase from last year, with the lowest growth since 2000, when records began to break.
After figures showing only a seven percent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say that internet sales are increasingly signaling weakening.
Andy Mulcahy, IMRG sales index editor, told the Guardian, "If you look at the growth levels of previous years, and especially the 2000s, you'll actually see things return to normal over time."
He added that three years before consumers began using mobile phones to buy products, internet sales had seen a huge increase.
This meant that more people could shop even while lying on the couch.
But right now it's going horizontally, so you can see the landing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept taken from America, is cited as one of the reasons why sales slow down.
Experts say consumers may be waiting for this event, which took place on the last Friday of November, to buy something.
At last year's event, when five times more consumers attacked companies' websites to grab cheap products than the previous year, the site of many companies collapsed.
Experts say Black Friday, which shows shoppers fighting over the discount, may have restrained shoppers "for now"
A study published by the British Association of Retailers found that one pound of every 5 pounds spent on shopping was spent on buying products online.
A third of some products, such as TVs and washing machines, are now purchased from online stores.
In addition, more than a quarter of people buy their clothes and shoes online instead of luxury and fancy shopping streets.
With the Bin Laden family found guilty, Muslims bid farewell to their final journey, those who lost their lives in a crane crash in Mecca
The bodies of 29 people who died after the first funerals in Mecca were carried on the streets by Muslims.
Saudi Arabia blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin group as responsible for crane crash
A total of 394 people were injured following the fall of the crane, the health ministry reported.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the bodies of 29 people who died when a crane fell into the Masjid al-Haram.
The crowd, mostly in white, closed the roads to send off their first funeral on their last voyage at Muaysim Cemetery in Mecca.
The painful mass crossed the holy place a few days ago, where a crane destroyed the ceiling of the mosque and the disaster overturned the pilgrims.
In the incident, which also included 394 wounded, the bodies of the dead were brought to be buried after the owner of the Saudi Kingdom's construction holding held Binladin's family accountable.
The bodies of 29 pilgrims who died when a crane fell into the Masjid al-Haram were carried along the shoulders along the way.
Among the dead was Kasım Akram, father of four children from the Bolton region of Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr. Akram had arrived at Masjid al-Haram with his parents at the beginning of the annual pilgrimage.
Saudi leaders have reported that the Hajj will continue with the participation of thousands of pilgrims on their way to Mecca.
King Salman today reported that the Binladin Holdings group should not leave the crane's arm open while it is out of use.
The Arabic version of the decree issued by the state-run Saudi Press Agency stated that Binladin Group was the only party to be charged with the incident.
The news agency's English service did not pass this detail, but the firm informed its officials that a ban was imposed on going abroad.
Earlier in the week, Salman vowed that they would find the reason for the crane to be overthrown in the courtyard of the Masjid al-Haram, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims arrived in the Hajj at the end of the month.
The Binladin group did not make any statement regarding the crane that was overturned, and their representatives were not allowed to comment.
The royal decree accused the group of failing to take current security measures and of failing to cooperate with meteorology officials.
The Masjid-i Haram in Mecca is surrounded by dozens of cranes, most of which are under the direction of the Binladin group.
The Binladin family has been in close relations with Saudi Arabia's executive family for decades, and is the head of most construction projects.
Osama Bin Laden, the last leader of Al Qaeda's organization, was also a deviant son the family had barred from adopting.
The accident occurred only a few days before millions flocked to the land of the Hajj, where every adult Muslim was required to visit at least once in their lives, during a time of heavy wind and rain.
Officials reported that 158 people were still receiving treatment at the hospital.
Officials instructed the families of the dead and survivors of the permanent injury to pay compensation of 1 million Riyal (174,000 pounds).
The other wounded will receive half of that amount.
B&Q boss says East European artisans working cheaply behind this trend
Veronique Laury says British recruit more and more masters
Behind this increase lies the number of Eastern European craftsmen
As a result, 200 new Screwfix stores are opening, targeting artisans.
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q sales points across the country.
Written By: Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail City Chief Reporter
The British are said to have started hiring skilled Eastern European artisans to do the work in their homes instead of leaving the hammers and paintbrushes in their hands.
If you are adept at using hammers or are skilled at wall painting, you are in the minority these days.
Because, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, Britons are increasingly employing masters to do DIY work in their homes.
Veronique Laury, the new general manager of Kingfisher, the owner of the home improvement chain, said that behind this trend is the large increase in the number of East European resourceful artisans offering services at low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to close 60 B&Q outlets, while opening 200 new Screwfix stores for artisans.
Ms. Laury said she wanted more women to be hired at B&Q stores because eight of the ten purchase decisions in the store were made by women.
Currently, the majority of staff are male.
She said that the single female home, which has made more home improvements compared to the past, is a need to meet the emerging demographic trends seen.
Ms. Laury said: "There are still mostly men working in our stores.
We need to balance even more.
Basically, half of our customers are women and 80 percent of decisions about purchased products are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Britain's leading firm index, Ms. Laury, one of the five women in the head of the FTSE100, also restructured her senior team to consist of an equal number of male and female directors.
Kingfisher, including his general manager and finance manager, is almost alone in this field, with a staff of 50 percent of his team consisting of women.
Mrs. Laury said: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find the good women to take on our board of directors.
After the group loaded the cost of the closing stores, Kingfisher announced a decline in both sub-monthly profits and sales.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, owner of Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Time for the U.S. Central Bank to decide interest hike for the Fed
The U.S. Central Bank's two-day meetings, which continue on Wednesdays and Thursdays, are monitored by the world; a decision is expected to be made ten years later on whether interest rates will be increased.
A Reuters poll found that slightly more than half of the 80 economists said last week that the Fed would implement this decision, while they now think it would suspend the decision and keep rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
Since seven years have passed since the Fed reduced rates to zero, this is a historic event.
Angel Ubide, a senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said, "For the first time, we will witness a large central bank coming out of zero and beginning the process of normalising interest rates."
The U.S. economy performs relatively well, adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and creating a small amount of inflation in the process of revitalizing the economy.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less promising global table.
He warned the markets against an increase, but there are indications that they also believe the situation will not allow such an increase.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8:00 p.m.
The perpetrator of the murder at Delta State University left an apology letter
On Tuesday, officials said, Shannon Lamb left a note in Mississippi Monday morning after killing her girlfriend with a gun and later that same day saying she was "sad" for the first murder before killing her workmate, wishing she could "take it back".
Mississippi Gautier police say Lamb, a geography and social sciences education instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10:00 p.m.
Monday, and he said he said he killed someone with a gun.
Lamb said he had to send police to the officer on the phone.
"I killed my wife last night," Lamb said, also stating that there was a "sweet dog at home that didn't hurt anyone" and that he was probably upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not specify his name.
Lamb didn't make any statements about the murder either.
When the police went to the scene, they encountered the lifeless body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a note written by Lamb, 45: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could get the time back.
I loved Amy so much, and she was the only one who ever loved me.
Lamb, after writing this note, drove his vehicle to Delta State, 300 miles away, killing history professor Ethan Schmidt, who then committed suicide when the police trapped him.
University Dean William LaForge stated that he did not know that there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "it is clear that there is something in Lamb's mind."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed that his girlfriend Prentiss had an emotional relationship with Schmidt as well, authorities said on Tuesday that they had "no information or evidence" of a "triangle of love".
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for nearly seven years, describes Prentiss as a "good person".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, and the girl was "disrupted".
O'Steen also stated that Prentiss and his daughter were "absolutely each other's best friends".
Linsday Knowless, who Sun Herald described as a close friend of Parentiss, stated that Prentiss was working online from his home.
Knowles said Prentiss, a hunting dog owner named Lightning, had been with Lamb for about 3 years.
"He always liked to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives on Monday, saying "I'm not going to jail."
That same night, when the police got close to him at Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled over, jumped on foot, ran into the woods and committed suicide by shooting himself with a gun.
According to his CV, published on the University's website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their old charm
The actor (left) who was seen with his son Redmond (right) had a very stressful few years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009, he sacrificed his life partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor, who is also said to have struggled with drugs, was arrested for possession of drugs in 2008.
All of this, of course, did him a lot of harm.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered from two fractures in a match when Manchester United were defeated by PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
While this incident, which tears the defense player, will leave him out of the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains hopeful that Shaw may return to the field this season.
The break was caused by 20-year-old Shaw entering the match without a hitch in the 15th minute of the match when he fell like a bomb on the field.
It was intervened on the field for nine minutes and then needed to be oxygenated before being transported to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "The couple is dislocated in the leg and is now in hospital."
Maybe today or the day after, he'll be transferred and operated on in Manchester.
It's a terrible situation - an 18-year-old young man who transferred to Manchester, first having a hard time, then having a great game, and then this happens to him.
She had an oxygen mask on her face when she was in the dressing room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double-decker fracture, that's at least six months, and it means you can't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to get away with the red card and the penalty shot.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official had made a mistake.
When I say it's a penalty and a red card, you can judge yourself.
It was a very bad fight with two legs.
The tweet on Shaw's account said, "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my healing path begins now, I'll return with strength."
Related: Manchester United suffers shock from Luke Shaw injury in PSV defeat
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, will be morale for the recovery of the English defensive player.
PSV manager Phillip Koc said: "It's a very bad injury."
Everyone would be upset if such an injury happened to any player.
Our players' intentions are never to cripple their opponent.
Moreno also suffered a leg break in the 2014 World Cup when he played for the Mexican team against Van Gaal's Netherlands.
The boy finds it very difficult because his intention was never to maim his opponent, and it was never good after hearing that it was a very bad fracture, he said.
In my view, there was no way to see that moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball going in a different direction, as if Moreno had touched him, but I couldn't see Luke playing.
"I know what it feels like. I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel terrible about it, and I'm so sorry.
He had been hospitalized as a result of a fight with Chris Smalling at PSV's Andres Guardado.
Of course David Cameron knows The Lorax better than that?
It's something that every parent learns in a short time: when your child loves a book, you know it's not going to take much time to learn it almost by heart.
It seems that if you're not David Cameron.
When asked what his favorite children's book was by a holiday programmer supplier for childcare, the prime minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss' 1971 environmental tale.
In his message posted on the SuperCamps company's website, Cameron writes that this is a difficult decision: "I like to read this book to my children because it contains an image or message that we've always missed in its content, which has a funny, impressive, creative, and powerful message."
So far, everything was going well, until the paragraph summarised by the 2012 film version of the book, in which Cameron supposedly wrote something about the content of the book but actually added new characters and details to inflate the content of the original fairy tale text.
In the city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature is destroyed, even air is meta, a boy named Ted wants to fulfill his desire to see a real tree in order to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, writes Dr. Seuss Geisel, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If that doesn't sound suspicious enough to you, the text Cameron discusses is somewhat similar to the short summary text of The Lora in the Internet Film Archive, which begins: "In Thneed-Ville, the city, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, wants to win the heart of Audrey, the girl who dreams of a child named Ted."
Judging from the claims that he was a competent parent, Cameron is unlikely to be aware of the main point of the book, in which an anonymous young boy hears how the local environment was destroyed by the greedy, tree-cut Once-ler, despite the objections of the beast named Lorax, who also gave the book its name, the mustache and the "talker in the name of trees".
It is likely that such a weak PR business has been referred to an orderly, who apparently has not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A presidential spokesman said the text was thought to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was supplied from Cameron's staff, but made no other comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of UK extraction, but he's still intact.
Playing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the British team chosen for the tour, I think it's a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeats that happened last time, not on the cards.
Still, I'm not leaving a away win out of the question.
Alastair Cook's team may be more inexperienced than it was three years ago, but they have players spinning well on the batting line, and the collective sense of play is strong; these do not heal 2012's wounds, but only provide some youthful optimism.
In the ball game, Moeen Ali develops as a game spinner, and Adil Rashid represents an attack option, even if the test-level quality is unknown.
Related: Adam Lyth exits England Trial team and is replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to remove Adam Lyth, as head coach in Yorkshire, is a difficult decision to analyze for me.
The Seven Trials were opposed to two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but inevitable fact is that cricketers are judged on the basis of the result.
For example, there were no question marks about Joe Root, which had to be announced because – as I said before – the players were their own best choice.
After several fifty-point series, Lyth could see his career grow longer, but he determined his own fate.
I'm hoping that if he works harder for Yorkshire, he'll get another opportunity.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised the player's attitude even though he did not perform best, which did not surprise me; above all, he is a team man.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it will take a Test batter to get his grade.
Lyth – like Sam Robson before him – took seven caps, while Nick Compton, on the other hand, took nine.
Only Compton had a chance to rematch.
For Jonathan Trott, the only pain you can feel is that England might go to the Caribbean first - when Lyth's form is at its peak - but this wasted opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and to me, he's a high-level hitter.
He's an X-factor cricketer, and we've seen that in Yorkshire, when he scored 236 against us at the Trent Bridge field earlier this season.
It should at least be taken for the same opportunity as before, but that depends, of course, on team formation in the United Arab Emirates.
Moeen's idea of making an opening shot next to Cook in a way that allows him to get an extra gamer while he's holding four quicks worked, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why a batter can't shoot here, and this left-winger has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen might not have done her job for Worcestershire, but she saw a number 3 for them, and it doesn't make much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tries in his first fall before starting his debut in 2001.
He immediately grabbed three hundred series and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup game spinner and surprised me as an impressive young man in my limited discussions with him.
People can see their raw statistics - 31 averages on the bat and 35 averages on the ball - and think it's a degage, but there aren't many game spinrs who raise their hands, and player choices are made in favor of the younger one.
He's going to learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the team, England seems to have made a few shrewd additions to its own coaching team.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the Trial matches could be an ingenious measure.
One of the cutest men in that game will bring with it a lot of experience, acquired under all circumstances and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball leg of the round and gives both energy and game order a brutal streak.
I always thought he was born for the world of international cricket, whether he was a player or a coach, and he has an understanding that can be taken as a guide like Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can bring a novelty to the team, even if they convey messages that have been said before.
Colly's teammate Ben Stokes from Durham is resting for a day of games, Root has been given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, the plans are not made by the coaches and those who choose the players.
And you have to remember that like the players, their work depends on the results.
Decisions like this are never easily taken.
Brexit camp could win if the economy is stagnant by 2017
David Cameron's semi-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and this is despite Jeremy "Yes or No?" being elected to Corbyn's Labour leadership, or the TUC's infuriated over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
Recently, a European diplomat, a friend of mine, stated that some member states are tired of Britain's agenda of divisive concessions and disrupting treaty changes, which they don't want most of them in the EU, which is completely overwhelmed by the kinds of crises that they don't cause.
The TUC decided that it did not want them if it damaged social protection during its annual meeting in Brighton.
We might even call it Dave and George's own agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in the capitals of foreign countries and take pictures of themselves, whether or not they are the dignitaries of the place in front of famous monuments there, then return to their country and say they are gathering allies for reform.
This is all about me.
When Berlin said, "Don't leave us alone with France," my European friend, who wanted an outward-looking Britain within the EU tent, stated that he had reached a point where more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals no longer cared whether or not we would remain.
Germany's cautious and sane chancellor, Angela Merkel, is an ally, however, she has been in power for 10 years, and she wants to leave power before the situation deteriorates, as in Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande faces re-election or a change in power in France in 2017.
It is also a fading force.
Soon, a nationalist government from the right in Poland, and a government from the left in Spain will come to power.
It is unlikely that these countries will make an effort for the Selfie Britons, who must use their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, because they don't want it either because most of them have separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers, in the style of the Scottish National Party, may be planning to speed up the Brexit process by making deliberate statements that would not benefit the situation during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign; my friend says so.
"Renegotiation was a dead end" and "Britain has achieved nothing that would benefit from renegotiation."
Europeans know from their previous experience how exploitative, oligarchic press barons of Fleet Street were because they were not like this in Tony Benn's time, they inspired the 1975 referendum, which approved our entry in 1973 at a rate of 2 to 1.
This is how they remember Boris Johnson, a Brussels correspondent in the early '90s, who announced his name as the "EU flat bananas".
All their folly aside, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
Among them were anti-tax vagrants, foreigners listening to illegal phones, and so-called outside residents who owned most of our major newspapers.
At the same time, Tony Blair was mostly thinking the same thing about them, however, when a horny gorilla was trapped in a cage, he understood that he had to distract him by giving him bananas for lunch and not to be eaten at tea time.
In fact, Miliband was also Blairite from Blair in opposing Cameron's idea of a bright referendum, as Blair had compromised the principle on the EU constitution, which was cancelled in 2005 by French and Dutch voters who gave him an exit card.
The press never forgave him about it either.
But it seems that Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, who pats my friendly back on Westminster on Monday -- I told him he no longer has time to lose -- is in danger of re-adopting the boycott strategy of Murdoch in the '80s, which was then a mistake.
Although it will take time, he needs to develop a consistent strategy to stay in touch with the media, not me, especially Andrew Marr, who left the BBC seat on Sunday.
I express Corbyn's official position in Europe as being politely developing.
He says he wants us to stay within a reformed EU.
Most of the people outside Ukip's hostile tendency, and the ardent supporters of Conservative Little Englandism, say yes to this.
Anyway, that's what Hilary Benn, a Benn but not a Bennite, said on radio and television this week, as she naively forced herself not to admit that it was a bad idea for Corbyn to appoint John McDonnell as shadow chancellor.
This reminded me of his father's struggle over infidelity on television to his fellow workers' cabinet members in the '70s, his lack of going too far, and his loss of office in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more appealing.
But in "Benn's statement - fighting to stay "in all circumstances" was not the same as what McDonnell said or what the JC told the lords to MPs at a special meeting on Monday night.
Considering that he also touched me, the detail-genele Corbyn is trying to convey remains of the importance of message discipline in the age of 24/7 TV, regardless of the hazy image, and especially in the social media vortex, which is a bed of paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell has said, it is perfectly reasonable to make difficulties with Europe, which allows Cameron to secure Labour's support in the referendum.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the Bennite siege economy and anti-capitalist histories of McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership are no longer the only minor differences left between left-wing dissidents where narcissism is one of the cornerstones of the edifice's narcissism.
As with his transition on Nato - Tom Watson is determined that JC will not campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will have to struggle to make sense of them for their master in their country.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital over concessions to Britain, where they can all go to waste, when they have their own skeptical electorate?
As I was told at the opening of the British Forum for Impact Security on Monday, the United States is already deeply disappointed by the British's poor minimum performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the ruling government of the cost-cutting Conservative Party.
Experts criticise UK public health e-cigarette research
The researchers stated that e-cigarettes were 95% less harmful than smoking in a 12-person meeting, which was conducted by a government-funded agency, with those linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Journal of Medicine (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the UK Public Health (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published its "turn-point" report last month, which it described as "a thorough examination of evidence".
But some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and noted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The Lancet medical journal's editorial last month targeted the "extraordinaryly rotten foundation" based on the main conclusion of PHE.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned whether the allegations were "constructed on the ground or on the rock."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of public health is that policies are based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said public claims by the PHE that "e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking by the best estimate available" would be expected to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this emerges from a meeting of 12 people assembled to develop a multi- criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to create a synthesis of their views on the damage to different products containing nicotine; the results of the meeting are summarized in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose general manager had previously been reported to have received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
They also said he approved the BAT's public health promotion document in a sustainability report.
They added that one in 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but this was not previously reported as receiving funds from the Philip Morris International cigarette company.
No information was given on how panel members were elected, but these included some known giants of e-cigarettes, some of whom reported industry funding in the article.
Others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was attended by the person in charge of tobacco at PHE.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the group's research paper "effectively" acknowledged the lack of "substantial evidence of the harms of most products by many criteria."
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said it was too early to argue that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a transition to smoking for children or non-smokers."
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and welfare at PHE, said the allegations at BMJ had been answered earlier.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two people with lifelong smokers dies from this addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small compared to those caused by them, but we must continue to study their long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear mandate: to inform the public of what evidence shows and does not show, especially at a time when there is much confusion about its harm when compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people a year die from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the NHS about 2 billion euros a year.
We are fulfilling our national responsibility by making clear the available evidence – that e-cigarettes carry only a small fraction of the damage caused by smoking, although not risk-free.
Previous Channel 4 chief says BBC should leave EastEnders
Previous Channel 4 president Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and stated that ad competitors could "give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square series.
Johnson said that the license fee should only be used to make programs of the kind not done by other British publishers.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs on channels such as BBC4, which are likely to be watched by a smaller audience, against their competitors' most ratings-area programs in valuable ranges.
After Tony Hall, the BBC's director general, said the agency wanted to collaborate more with other organizations; Johnson said that in his own time on Channel 4 to form a bond with the BBC, this was unsuccessfully tried for six years.
Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee during an interrogation of the BBC's future, "I am struggling with the idea that the BBC will order and broadcast programs that can be clearly shown by non-subsidised competitors."
If you maintain the license fee app, which I'm not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, its output should be reduced to programs that others don't or order at least.
He's broadcasting The Voice in the primetime range because they want to provide as much support as possible for my future.
The main idea here is based on the idea that no one else will publish it, which is ridiculous and clearly ridiculous.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why programs that can be funded without help should be funded with a reduced rate of tax.
The Voice is another one, and EastEnders is actually being done in-house.
To be honest, other channels give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see what public service publications are like.
I don't think that's going to cut the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series of entrepreneurs who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings "for the passion of the people who work here and for the fact that these employees see this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support."
The BBC's comments on its most popular shows echo the comments of former Sky administrator Tony Ball, who used MacTaggart's lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell programs like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's more appropriate public service programs went to BBC4, where audience measurement could not be done, but they met the tax amnesty and could argue to continue their staunch religious duties on providing the ground for 4 billion pounds in license fee income: "We, of course, are doing all these sill programs that no one else is watching."
They put these in gaps that no one will ever watch.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: "I invite you to come up with a more regressive system in terms of the people who get the best out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think, it's a great value of 150 pounds a year, but I wonder if the reason they do this for people where 150 pounds is a lot of money is because they don't watch too much BBC.
David Elstein, the previous Sky and Channel 5 executive who also presented evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said that some of the BBC's output is now officially classified as education – that's 1% of TV output and 0.1% of radio – and that public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should be a front-runner, and that this should be changed to "information, lighting and training".
Regarding partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do something about Proms shown on TV but only a handful of them, and engage in collaborations with advertising broadcasters to ensure they are all watched online.
'Sonogenetic' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how threadworms change direction the moment they are struck by sound vibrations.
Scientists have grown maggots with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
Tiny threadworms change direction as soon as they are struck by sound vibrations at a high-pitched level that humans can't hear.
The vibrations are activated by genetically modified motor nerve cells to carry membrane channels that respond to trans-sound waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the maggots proved the strength of a new procedure called Sonogenetics so that ultrasound could be used to activate a number of brain, heart, and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an intrusive procedure that gives people electrical vibrations inside their brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Yarnworms often do not respond beyond sound, but Chalasani found that they react when surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles he finds amplify the trans-sound waves, allowing them to pass through the maggots.
Reinforced trans-sound waves affect structures in the membranes of some maggot cells called TRP-4 ion channels.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are attached to.
To create trans-sound-controlled threadworms, Chalasani genetically modified the maggots to allow some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applied trans-sound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were powered by micro-cablets and transmitted into the maggots, where it activated the motor neurons that were also altered.
This procedure has similarities to optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to operate and shut down neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says sonogenesis may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that must be sent through an optical fiber to the desired point within the brain, low-frequency trans-sound waves can pass through the tissue unimpeded and thus be sent through the skull into the brain.
Chalasani said, "By using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, we believe that targeted human neurons in the clinical setting for specific neurological treatments can be made temporarily susceptible to trans-sound signaling."
He added that other applications can focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment- right on your doorstep!
Advertisements condemn UK arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-gun fair video.
Horrible killer drones!
The shackles that smash your ankle!
Piece-influenced bombs!
And electric shock batons that cause severe pain but leave no trace!
The fine audio and cartoon footage produced for Amnesty International, prepared to highlight the British government's desire to sell weapons to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCel Centre in London Docks, leaves no doubt that the world's largest arms fair is a sharp hoax.

However, a different campaign continues with posters on bus stops and subway trains, requiring a double look.
One of them uses the London Metro fonts and brand to turn the DLR line into a tank, saying, "Important announcement, are you going to travel in the DLR from September 15 to 18?"
This September, a pack of arms dealers will attack the DLR... customers are asked to help stop this arms fair.
300 posters from artists exhibiting at Bansky's Museum of Cruel Designs in Dismaland.
A collective, called the Special Patrol Group, helped distribute it using the "Pulse Packages to the Advertising Area", which is 6 euros and claims it "gives access to about a third of the bus stop ad spaces on the planet".
Transportation for London this poster was not satisfied with its "vandalism".
One of the ads was created by the Special Patrol group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more and more interrogative and are looking for ways to move political affairs to the masses outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving in with activists within the protest movement and are beginning to realize that they need to come out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-gun trade poster appears in front of travelers on the subway.
Amnesty International's video was viewed over 100,000 times on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, which works for free, and they also produced the graphic designer and the audio artist for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was surprised by the silence against gun fair ads - with free space on the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to run away from."
They played with the idea of making a more realistic, shrewd corporate ad, but "they decorated it with bright colors and animation, it became more remarkable."
Tom Davies of Amnesty said: "They have been very helpful to us in creating concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment in the Fuar."
What we need now is the UK government to act to prevent torture equipment from being sold illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art at the arms fair comes from the inside ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic cover-up products.
In a press release, Saab showed the U.S. military's order for an "AT4CS RS launched from the shoulder".
This includes "a warhead with a unique shape and a massive impact by passing armor to the target".
Whatever he's doing, it's not going to be nice.
Eight golden rules of living in student hostels
It's been 11 years since I moved into student dorms as an uninteresting 19-year-old, and I still believe in berets and moral relativism, but now I remember the phony smiles of those I've offended - and their numerous complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight golden rules.
Moving in the dorm can watch from annoying to completely terrifying.
The seductiveness of babbling: where you're from, whether you're losing years, where you insist on Corbyn, and why you're "clearly not to love or hate Marmite because really, gentlemen, that's just the yeast extract HAHAHAH I'll be in my room."
Take a breath.
And let others take one too - ask questions and show relevance.
This will direct the conversation and help you separate what you like from the people you won't talk to, even if your eyelashes are on fire and they're spraying fire extinguishers.
Leave some space for people.
People's rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie night venues, and mass hangouts, but these are also places where people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting college with a relationship
Introverts are treated badly in college.
Your room may be a retreat, but many dorm corridors develop a culture of inter-room hanging, and this is friendly, social, and open to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone trying to store energy.
Nothing in culture will allow you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go a little bit so that I can put back the energy I spent communicating with you."
Try to sense that a friend is tired of socializing and maybe text instead of knocking on the door.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A friend in a student hostel had made a policy, as he was invited inside if the door was not locked.
He saw a lot of things.
Don't make friends through cooking.
Since you started college at the peaks of the food contest craze, it will be less awkward to introduce yourself by knocking on people's doors with a plate of brownies and less 1950s "welcome to our neighborhood, I cooked something for you, now smile as I ask you personal questions".
Offering people homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates may feel compelled to talk and perhaps associate your face with a sweet surprise.
Frankly, it's about you being a master cook.
A well-mixed lump of dough, sugar, and oil will cause people to pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a very common crime in student dormitories.
Frankly, scratching someone's chicken is theft, but stealing a few drops of milk for your tea?
Check the milk owner twice.
He'll probably tell you to take care of yourself even if he's swimming in it.
It's very uncomfortable for someone to steal their stuff, and I understand you- but try to deal with it more maturely than my dorm friend, who has put in liquid soap to punish the one who stole his milk.
He's in jail now.
Don't make noise in a way that stops people from sleeping or studying.
It doesn't just mean being a decent person, but because you're the people in the glass houses.
A girl in my hallway told her next-door neighbor to press down the drums a little bit because it's 3:00 a.m. and she's the morning test.
Their answer was to make the sound even louder.
When they finally closed at 5 a.m., the girl opened her own music and locked the door, allowing them to sleep for two hours before taking her own three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife moved into the same hallway as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be weird if you mistook a fellow hallway and thought you were your future wife, hung out, broke up and had to see her every day and watch your mutual friends be taken prisoner?
Of course it's the heart, but if your hot hallway neighbor is definitely not your future wife, at least talk to the junior and recommend common sense.
When you notice someone leaving their keys inside without locking their door in a joyous moment, know that the line between joking and persecuting someone is thinner than you think.
A good joke is fun, but it will take time to get back.
You can teach someone a valuable and fun lesson in safety by hiding their belongings- but never pollute someone's room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and put your keys in the freezer in a glass of water, but don't stick your stuff in the ceiling more than twice.
Parliamentary head of immigrant origin to the Netherlands
Arib, who received the highest vote in the fourth round of yesterday's election in parliament, became the Netherlands' first parliamentary president of immigrant origin.
Arib, who also holds Moroccan citizenship, will take over the post until 2017.
Arib also ran for president in 2012 in parliament, where he has served as an MP since 1998, but was not elected.
Surprise suitor to Hope Cloud!
The latest offer to Umut Bulut, who did not reconcile with G.SARAY supporters and suffered from a demoralization due to the protests of the stands in the last matches, came from Eskişehirspor.
He missed this position, wanted out of the game!
During Ryan Donk's transfer period, Eskişehirspor made the final step for the national goalkeeper that Kasımpaşa wanted to add to his squad.
However, the red blacks were given a negative response by the G.Saray administration.
His heart stopped as he became beautiful.
Raquel Santos (28), mother of two children living in RIO DA JANEIRO, applied to his aesthetic doctor last Monday to remove the marks from the laughter on the sides of his mouth.
The woman who was injected with filling material into her face accelerated her heart rate and breathing after a while.
He then died as a result of a cardiac arrest.
Police are investigating whether the woman's daily use of the drug "Potenay" had a role in her death.
The actual cause of death will be revealed after the autopsy.
One of the model's closest friends, Debora Azevedo, told the Brazilian press that Santos, one of whom had two sons, aged 7 and 13, was obsessed with plastic surgery.
Santos, who participated in Moses do Brasil, one of Brazil's most important beauty contests, in December, was second.
Oil companies officially collapse
From 2014, when oil prices began to fall, nearly $400 billion of investment was delayed by the end of last year, while the most deep-sea (deepwater) oil exploration projects were suspended.
According to research by consulting company Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices have led to the suspension of the $380 billion project in oil and gas exploration/production, while production of millions of barrels from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa has also been delayed in a wide geography.
The report, which shows oil prices falling to the lowest level in 12 years, shows that when they were at $115 in the summer of 2014, they lost 70 percent in 1.5 years.
400 MILLION DOLAR ASKIDA
Crude oil prices are making new surprises every day, with the latest falling below $30, seeing the lowest level in the past 12 years.
The research published by energy consulting company Wood Mackenzie today, in which the debate on whether oil is now cheaper than water, reveals how the industry is affected by falling prices.
Finally, in a July report, Wood Mackenzie reveals that falling oil prices led to the suspension of 46 major energy investments worth $200 billion, revealing where this figure reached by the end of 2015.
According to this, 22 other major projects have been delayed in the last six months of 2015, while 68 major projects have been suspended in total since the oil collapse began in 2014.
The value of these projects is about $400 billion.
DAY 2.9 MILLION VARILLION
Highlighting the impact of low oil prices on company plans, the study notes that the projects most affected are deep-sea development projects.
Suspended projects total 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent to the reserve, while daily production of 2.9 million barrels of oil by 2025 is thus delayed.
According to the study, the final investment decision of most of the projects in question was postponed to 2017 and beyond, while the initial production targets shifted from 2020 to 2023.
Among the 68 projects that were postponed, the report highlighted the potential investment of $170 billion projected to be made over the next five years, "The majority of the $170 billion is deep-sea projects."
This is due to the fact that the pre-investment cost is very high.
"Seventy percent of deep sea spending also accounts for oil-intensive projects in Nigeria, Angola and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico," it says.
According to the study, the countries with the most deferred oil project inventory are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries own almost 90 percent of the deferred liquid (petrol) reserves.
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, the countries with the largest amount of deferred gas reserves, together account for 85 percent.
While much of the gas waiting to come out around here is located in the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development solutions such as installing a zero-liquidated gas (LNG) facility.
The most compromised companies are oil giants with successive commitments in the deep sea, Canadian oil sand and Caspian Region, while the companies are also trying to adapt to the "longer lower" oil price scenario.
EYES IN IRAN
Not long ago, about four years ago, there was this painting: the United States and Europe had brought an embargo on Iranian oil to stop Tehran's nuclear program, the barrel price of oil was about $110, and how Iranian oil exports would be cut down without causing a sudden spike in prices.
By the time we get back this week, we're seeing a whole different scenario.
Oil prices have seen under $30 for the first time since 2004, the main reason being the boom in production in the United States, and the embargoes imposed on Iran are rising.
Therefore, the eyes are on Iran.
If Iran increases its oil exports, more oil will flow into the oil market, which is already said to be quite saturated.
This could cause prices to fall below the levels that surprise us today.
Some analysts say that Saudi Arabia, which does not want to lose market share to Iran, will pump even more oil, and that a price war could occur between Iran and S. Arabia.
As soon as sanctions are lifted, Iran's main goal is recorded as Asia's fast-growing oil market being its former partners in India and Europe.
Iranian officials had previously said that they aimed to increase exports by 500,000 barrels per day in the first place, and to release another amount after a while.
According to Reuters' map information, 22 very large crude oil carriers (VLCCs) are waiting off the coast of Iran, while at least 13 of them are fully or in large quantities.
Iran is the country with the fourth largest proven oil reserves in the world.
Thanks to sanctions exceptions, Iran still exports about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries, including Turkey.
Before the sanctions, Iran's daily oil exports had grown to as many as 3 million barrels per day.
Support Securities Research Expert Aysun Göksu answers the question of whether oil goes below $20: "China-based global growth concerns increase downward pressure on commodity prices, while deepening the loss in oil prices."
With concerns that oil demand will decrease in line with the economic slowdown in China, the world's largest importer of oil, we see losses to 20 percent since New Year's.
In addition, with the dollar gaining global value and the impact of the global supply surplus problem, we can witness prices below $30 in oil in the coming days.
As long as we don't see permanent pricing on $32-33 levels, the upward movement in oil may be limited and downward pressure may increase.
At this point, it can be said that the sighting of closures below the critical $30 level has a key role to play in keeping the declines going.
In such a case, it should not be a surprise that there are relaxations on the lower side that last until the 23.30-25.60 support zone.
Isham Sardouk: 'The era of angels is over!'
While Victoria's Secret and WGSN, which determines the world's fashion trends, took on the role of trend creativity, why did you turn the route to Turkey?
- I'm always in favor of change.
I was born in Paris, lived in London, then went to New York.
I also took on important positions there.
Meanwhile, I've been advising Koton for the last two years.
Then I saw the potential in this geography and the Koton brand.
I realized that there was everything that was needed to become a world-age store chain.
Now I'm here to make it happen.
Will you be able to do it soon?
- Exactly.
Although it is already a young brand, it is already sold in 50 countries.
We publish 50 collections a year, there are 15 separate sections.
So there's everything a chain of stores needs to have.
From Dubai to Moscow, we are able to respond to the needs of consumers in different geographies.
Now we're opening a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting era...
Is it necessary to open a store in Paris?
- Yeah.
Not because Europe's economic situation is fantastic.
But you open some stores for the image.
In fashion capitals like Paris, London, you have a shop, you make the money from the Middle East.
One adds prestige to the brand, the other adds money, both essential to a brand that plays to globality.
So let's talk about trends...
We have a very romantic, stylish season ahead of us.
Flying chiffon dresses, soft tones, pinks, whites, reds.
Patterns...
We go through very difficult and brutal times, and the fashion world is always trying to add a little bit of happiness to life by bringing stylish, uplifting designs to the podium.
That's what we do.
That's why the "age of grace" is coming back in the new season.
Back to your years at Victoria's Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel? - Karolina Kurkova.
I'm not just talking about her amazing physique: she's such a positive, so good girl!
While I was working, he would sit next to me and feed me apples or something, like, "Honey, are you hungry?"
It was so sweet.
You know, I looked into what I was talking about, and you interviewed all Victoria's Secret models.
How beautiful was Karolina?
But Adriana Lima also impressed me with her beauty.
- Say yes, that voice!
That speech, that tone...
After a while, you get nervous and say, "Sit aside and look beautiful, and don't do anything else!"
It's annoying.
That's right, there are shocks like that.
I interviewed Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, but I was horrified by her frivolity.
Most of them are like that now.
The new angels are not the same...
I remember Gisele's period...
It was also very difficult to work with him, though.
He used to come backstage, smoke like a chimney.
Not that it's a tiryaki.
No one can drink it, he's the only one who can drink it!
Let's make it a 'diva'.
The Victoria's Secret fashion show, released two months ago, received the lowest rating in its history.
Why do you think?
Like I said, it's over, it's the time of the beautiful angels.
I'm sorry, but who's going to do Gigi Hadid?
What's good about it?
Kendall Jenner, for example, like a board...
No curls, no nothing.
Kate Moss also had zero curves, but became the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but how beautiful was his face.
I want to exercise my right to object here.
I interviewed him last year, his face was pretty low...
- All that smoking, drinking, now it's ugly.
But he had such a pretty face in the '90s.
His lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
He had reached the end of his supermodel era.
The era of Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington...
Christy was my next-door neighbor and I saw her without makeup every morning.
Such a clear beauty cannot be such grace.
And Cara Delevingne?
- He's wasting himself.
It's not every campaign.
People are tired.
There's no hunger for 'famous models, celebratorys' as it used to be.
People like themselves, want to see real faces in campaigns.
That's what we're going to do.
Because that's the trend.
Turkey letter from 25 authors
According to BBC Turkish, the authors, including the presidents of the International Writers' Union (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, stated that threats and physical attacks targeting colleagues, journalists and broadcasters in Turkey have become a normal part of life.
The letter listed two attacks targeting the daily Hurriyet in Turkey, the Koza group raid and the detention of Vice News reporters, as well as investigations and arrests against journalists among alarming developments.
Mother's right to half work raises controversy
Turkish-Business "We think mothers have been given half the right to work so that rental labor can be brought back."
"This could be a trojan horse," TİSK said, "we are concerned that this arrangement, which will be in women's favor, will prevent women from working."
New rights, which were planned to be introduced to officer and worker female employees after birth or adoption, passed through the commission with all-day negotiations.
The most common issue that came up at the commission talks of regulations that allowed part-time work or free leave for 6 months after birth, until the child reached primary school age, was "rental labor".
CHP İzmir MP Musa Çam stated that it is correct to have partial work done until the child goes to elementary school but that they have some concerns and said, "If you bring the rental labor arrangement after this, we will be against it until the end."
Enis Bagdadioğlu, who participated in the commission talks on behalf of Turkish-Business, expressed similar concerns, saying, "We have doubts about how to replace the female employee in half-time work."
If hired labor is brought up again on this occasion, there will be new problems that will exceed the subcontracting work floor, said Bagdadioğlu, "We will follow developments regarding private employment offices with concern for this reason."
Bülent Pirler, Secretary General of TİSK, stated that partial work was introduced by law for 5 years, while "so long-term partial work is not available in other countries."
And look at it this way.
"Where there are 1 or 2 employees, it is necessary to consider the consequences of this practice," he said.
TOBB Counsellor Ahmet Şağar also said that there would be trouble finding workers if the practice were to take place.
Stating that there is no legislation on the rules to be applied in part-time work, Şağar said, "A compromise should be reached between the worker and the employer, whoever has the regulation regarding private employment offices."
Metin Feyzioğlu: We don't support
Feyzioğlu's statement reads: "We do not agree with this declaration, we are not able to participate and support it."
Because there is no criticism of the PKK in one sentence.
You couldn't say anything negative to the PKK, the separatist terrorist organization, and you didn't put dust on it.
We do not take the heavy statements made solely and solely towards the state seriously and find them sincere, taking into account those who have expended them.
We're lawyers, we're lawyers.
If the state's representatives, public officials, security forces are acting unlawfully in this framework, let us follow it.
When we say, "Don't destroy the state," to the remnants of the Romantizing period, looking at the separatists or the separatists with sympathy, they attack us as "divisive, fascist".
When we say, "This state must act in accordance with the law, it must always uphold the law," they say, "You are being divisive."
We are the bridge.
We are always responsible for telling the truth.

Who is Bergen?
Bergen, whose real name was Belgin Sarlımer, was born in Mersin on July 16, 1960.
With the divorce of his parents, he settled in Ankara in 1966 with his mother Sebahat Çakır.
After Yenimahalle Yunus Emre Primary School, he entered the Piano Department of the Ankara State Conservatory but, due to financial difficulties, he left and grew his age and worked at PTT for a while.
In 1979, he accepted the offer to work after performing at the Feyman Night Club, where he went to have fun with his friends.
In the Feyman Night Club, he performed with the band Locomotive orchestra with repertoires of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and the Arabes, which were the fashion of the period.
After Ankara, Bergen went to Adana for work, where he met Halis Serbes and married a year later.
In 1982, he released "I Have a Story", his first longplay from Atlas Records.
Bergen, who could not stand her husband's violence while his debut in art life continued, escaped from his wife many times.
In October 1982, while working in İzmir, she was thrown into the face with her husband's determination.
In this attack, Bergen, who lost one eye and burned most of the body, was persuaded and performed by Cengiz Özşeker, the composer of the song "Who knows?", which made Kibariye famous after the treatment.
Performing in İzmir Pirlanta Pavilion, owned by Özşeker until 1985, he prepared a demo tape with his boss called "Our Brother Fate" and sent it to Yaşar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul?
The artist, who released his first professional longplay in the Istanbul music market, "Human Severse", under the direction of Burhan Bayar's music, became famous for his "Woman of Pain" in late 1986.
In April 1987, she was awarded the Golden Record and the Golden Tape by the record label with the title "Best Selling Arabesque Female Artist of the Year 1986".
In the same year, Yalçın Gülhan appeared on camera with Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron in the film "Woman of Pain" with the script and directorship of Ulku Erakalın.
Bergen, who gained a large fan base, survived the knife attack he suffered in Adana, where he went for the concert, at the last minute.
The artist, who also left the stage for a period, released the albums "Burn Him God", "The Price of My Love" and "I Don't Want" respectively in the directors of the great masters Selami Şahin, Özer Şenay and Cengiz Tekin.
Bergen, who was also officially divorced from her husband in April 1989, made her return to the scenes in June 1989 with her last album, "Years Don't Forgive".
The artist, who started the promotional tours of the album, which was met with intense interest, was shot to death by his wife, whom he divorced on the night of August 14, 1989, in Adana Pozantı, on August 15.
His hometown was buried in Mersin.
Bergen also packed a video film with 5 longplays and 129 songs on 11 tapes to his 29-year short life.
Claims that the artist, who signed arabeske with his different and powerful voice, had become legendary, gained accuracy when the album "My Youth Gone" was exhausted from the first day following his death.
Bergen's officially released studio albums:
1982 – I Have a Complaint LP (reprinted as MC in 1986.)
1983 – Brother Kader LP (reprinted as MC in 1985 and 1990.)
1985 – Human Severse LP, MC (reprinted as CD in 1999).
1986 – Woman of Pain LP, MC (reprinted as CD in 1999).
1987 – Burn It as well, LP, MC (reprinted as CD in 1999).
1988 – The Price of My Love MC (reprinted as a CD in 1999.)
1988 – I don't want LP, MC (reprinted as CD in 1999).
1989 – Years Don't Forgive (originally his last album) MC (reprinted as a CD in 1999).
1990 – My Leaving Youth MC (reprinted as a CD in 1999.)
1990 – Garibin's Freak Biter MC in the Grave (reprinted as a CD in 1999.)
1991 – My Last Cry MC, CD
Nazım Hikmet commemorated on his 114th birthday
Nazim Hikmet Ran, known as the Country Poet, was commemorated in the 114th year of his birth with the event "Glad You Were Born Nazim".
The event, organized by Konak Municipality, took place in the hall named after the poet at Güzelyalı Cultural Center.
With the event, poetry and music plays were performed and the famous poet's poems were performed by the theatre and film actor Rüştu Asian.
He also accompanied Asian with comments from the Three Anatolian Music Ensembles at the event.
Nazım Hikmet accompanied the event in many art lovers.
These names included Ali Seçkiner Buyer, Erkoç Torun, Nedim Yıldız and Zeynep Göknur Yıldız and Ziya Özsökmen.
In Istanbul, the event was organized by the Nazım Hikmet Culture and Art Foundation.
Foundation President Rutkay Aziz and members, daughter, son-in-law and grandson of Nâzım Hikmet's wife Vera Tulyakova, met in Tarabya for the event.
He will read poems and leave carnations to the sea with the slogan "Living as one tree and as one free / And as a forest, as a sister."
The event, organized with the contributions of Sarıyer Municipality, will be accompanied by Nâzım Hikmet Choir songs.
Nazım Hikmet was born on 15 January 1902.
The poems of the world-famous poet Nazim Hikmet have been translated into more than 50 languages.
He was repeatedly arrested for his political beliefs and spent most of his adult life in prison or exile.
His poems have been translated into more than fifty languages and his works have received many awards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
Bursa Nilüfer Municipality made special work for the 114th birthday of the world-renowned poet Nazim Hikmet.
The municipality, which works for the documentary "The Nazim of Bursa", which describes Nazım's days in 11-year-old Bursa Prison, also issued a personal stamp for the poet for the first time in Turkish history.
Thus, in cooperation with PTT, the first personal stamp was issued in the name of Nazım Hikmet in the history of Turkey.
These special stamps and first day envelopes, priced at $1.40, will be gifted to guests on Thursday, January 14 at the Nazım Hikmet Kültürevi.
They will be deported by bicycle.
However, refugees, most of whom are Syrians, will have to return to Russia, this time pedaling at minus 20 degrees Celsius, as no agreement has been reached between the two countries.
A group of refugees, on the grounds that it was safer and cheaper during the summer months, flew to Russia and moved north of the country from Murmansk to Norway.
Because the agreement between the two countries did not allow them to cross the border on foot, immigrants had crossed the border by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to repatriate these refugees.
Therefore, Norwegian law enforcement instructed to repair bicycles that had been abandoned when crossing the border.
EU crisis of "3 billion euros for Turkey"
The crisis over 3 billion euros committed to Turkey for refugees is ongoing.
European Union Commission President Jean Claude Juncker criticised Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's blocking of funds to be transferred to Turkey.
Noting that the mood between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good, Juncker stressed that the EU has to find 3 billion euros.
"This money is not for Turkey, but for Syrian refugees in Turkey."
We haven't reached 3 billion yet.
"This is a matter of EU credibility, so it is important," he said.
Juncker said he expected the money to be completed by January 26th, the date previously given.
Italy is among the countries that stand out with its positive attitude when it comes to Turkey.
Diplomatic sources say Rome's stance on the financial package is not a direct move towards Turkey and is linked to problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some Union countries.
There has been tension between Italy and the EU for some time.
During and after the last EU summit on energy, banking and migrants, Renzi continued to criticize German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EU harshly.
Criticizing Renzi's stance at yesterday's press conference, Juncker said "Renzi should stop blaming the EU."
"Renzi's, which I love very much, is wrong to insult the EU Commission at every opportunity," he said.
Juncker hinted that Renzi was playing for the public.
1 billion of Turkey's promised 3 billion euros will be covered by the EU budget.
2 billion euros will come from member states' budgets.
Germany will contribute at least 427m euros.
For political reasons, it was agreed that the Greek Government would not transfer money to Turkey, transferring its share of 2.3 million euros to the EU budget for use in support of Jordan and Lebanon.
The resource is projected to be used during 2016-2017.
I cried when I saw the Charlie Hebdo cartoon
Speaking to the Russian official news agency Sputnik, father Abdullah Kurdi reacted harshly and said, "I cried for this cartoon, if you will."
"I felt terrible," he said.
The French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which became a symbol of freedom of expression following the armed attack, expressed their expectation of positive things, father Kurdi said:
Unfortunately, they made a bad cartoon.
Everyone was very upset about this cartoon.
Aylan is a 2-year-old boy and he died.
Charlie Hebdo was supposed to respect Aylan, me and my family, but the opposite happened.
This magazine should respect the dead child people.
They published a disrespectful cartoon about our prophetic master.
They have published about God.
It is a small thing that has been done to my child in the face of Allah and the Prophet.
Kurdi, who lives in Erbil, made the following call: "My call to the whole world and humor magazine, all children who die must be respected."
It shouldn't upset their families, it shouldn't add pain to their suffering.
Aylan Kurdi's aunt, Tima Kurdi, who lived in Canada, was one of those who reacted to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau, a 3-year-old Syrian Aylan Kurdi, whose lifeless body hit the Bodrum beach in the signed cartoon, has the implication that she could be 'one of the harassers in Germany' when she grows up.
Last year, Charlie Hebdo, a French humor magazine that was attacked by radical religiousists for publishing cartoons, was again the focus of controversy because of his caricature of Aylan Kurdi.
The cartoon depicts harassers, particularly in Cologne, Germany, who are pig-faced and callous of immigrants chasing women, as was the case with the women's abuses during the New Year's celebrations.
The cartoon, which causes different reactions on social media, is actually part of a four-square column.
The column says, "This is not France," and many readings have criticized increasing refugee hostility, along with other values lost to France.
On the other hand, the cartoon still led many to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
Charlie Hebdo magazine praised Germany, which also agreed to receive 800,000 refugees in a issue published last year, while criticizing France's unwillingness to open its doors to immigrants.
The cartoon said, "He was too close to his goal," while the ad poster said, "Two children's menus for one price."
'An autopsy on Germans killed in Sultanahmet in Germany'
According to the weekly Der Spiegel magazine website, the Federal Prosecutor's Office of Germany has decided to bring the body of 10 people who lost their lives in the attack to Germany.
The funerals of the deceased will be received by a German Air Force aircraft in a ceremony today or tomorrow at the country and airport.
In Germany, experts from the Federal Criminal Office (BKA)'s Identification Commission, which conducts forensic procedures, go to the countries where the incident occurred for German citizens who died in accidents or attacks under normal circumstances, and perform identification and autopsies there.
However, Der Spiegel magazine wrote that this time the situation would be different.
According to the magazine, officials from the Federal Criminal Office appealed to Turkish authorities for identification of the deceased and for the autopsy to take place in Istanbul, but Turkish officials did not accept the proposal.
The Federal Criminal Office had sent four experts to Istanbul following the Istanbul attack.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are undergoing hospital treatment.
Ellen Meiksins Wood has died.
Meiksins Wood, a well-known political theorist and socialist historian, had come to mind with his important work on the origins of capitalism in particular.
Born in New York City in 1942, the works of Latvian-born Meiksins Wood, also published in Turkish, are as follows: Escape from Class -- The Archaic Culture of Capitalism -- Capitalism vs. Democracy -- The Origin of Capitalism -- The Capital Empire -- Return to Marx
Ban on swimming pool for asylum-seekers
The German media reported that the municipality would lift the ban if it was reported that the message of the ban was understood by asylum seekers.
Markus Schnapka, a social worker who noted in a statement to WDR that the municipality did not want to punish the innocent for the conduct of several people, said that they informed the residents of the dormitories in three languages about the values that were important in Germany.
Schnapka noted that they do not discuss the value of gender equality that Germany cares about, adding that the municipality will punish any kind of assault and harassment.
On the other hand, the carnival parade in Rheinberg was cancelled due to the possibility that harassment scandals in Cologne would occur in the upcoming carnival parades.
The municipality announced the cancellation of the carnival parade as there is no guarantee that there will be no incidents of harassment.
What are the benefits of cooking in steam?
Steam cooking technique, a technique that does not kill the vitamins and minerals inside the food, is becoming increasingly popular.
Steam cooking, one of the most preferred cooking techniques in the Far East for centuries, makes metabolism stronger and easier to digest.
With this method, which eliminates problems, such as indigestion, bacteria and microbes found in nutrients also die completely.
Substances such as protein, cellulose, and starch within the food are completely melted by this technique, which makes the food softer.
Steam cooking, which takes place at low pressure, is carried out in a pot with the help of steam containers or a steam machine.
In cooking at high pressure, the amount of water used and the cooking time is small.
The best example of this is cooking in a pressure cooker.
In order to cook foods such as vegetables, which are especially included in diet menus, one must first wash the vegetables thoroughly and then put them in a filter and wait for them to glide well.
A deep pot is filled with water at a rate of one-third and the steam strainer is placed inside the pot.
The mouth of the pot is left half closed.
This allows the steam to come out of the pot comfortably.
The furnace fire is first brought to the highest level, allowing the water to boil, then the furnace fire is brought to a lower level, resulting in a constant heat.
Vegetables and nutrients cooked in steam for about 10 to 15 minutes are controlled with the help of a fork after cooking well.
The cooked vegetables are taken from the stove and served by placing them on plates.
In steam cooking technique, the appearance, color, and smell of the food do not change, so this method is healthy.
The food tastes the same.
Thus, the quality and flavor of the food will be intact.
In steam cooking, which is also one of the most economical cooking methods, nutrient loss is also kept to a minimum.
Steam-cooked vegetables also offer a satisfying feast to those who eat with their more vibrant appearance.
This method, which is especially often used in diet foods, is also often preferred because it is light.
David Bowie - Blackstar: Alien's "last" album
To know you're going to die; to make that last album without telling anyone, to make the deathbed an artistic expression in the music video you shot...
Jobs like this may seem too "on the fly" for us earthling mortals.
I say Earthling mortals because I am among those who believe in the fact that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He had come to our Earth from another corner of the universe; now he has returned to his homeland; that is all that has happened.
He came because there was an inspiration to be given not only to Kiss, Marilyn Manson, or Lady Gaga, but to artists all over the world.
He completed his mission with merit.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: $9.99 5/5
He probably fed from Warhol, Kubrick, who was from the same planet as him.
When Apollo 11 landed on the Moon, he decided to say, "Is this something or I'm an alien?" and he got involved by singing "Space Oddity."
He didn't really get involved; he always went a few steps ahead.
A lot of people found their way through it.
Both the musician and the listener...
Putting aside his interest in plastic arts, his acting, and all that, it would be unfair to say "It was just music" for his music.
Discography with its references, innovation, taboovirenity, and the characters it personally creates, which circulates from song to song, represents an artistic integrity for me.
I can't refer to him as the ancestor of glam rock, nor can I refer to him as the cousin of punk...
What about those avant-garde electronic moves, the jazz he's been hiding as love since he was a child?
David Bowie kept reminiscing about what the word meant until those years when we were chewing gum in our mouths.
It wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman; it wasn't a man.
It was a body.
He appeared to us for a while because of a mission.
That body left this world two days after its 26th studio album, "Blackstar", was released.
Before the album was released, he tried to practice going with "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" that we listened to.
We were thinking, "He's old, he's talking about death or something," and he was aware of everything.
One last game...
It was released much earlier, except for the magnificent "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", which bore the burden of the album's message and emotion, but was re-edited for this album and recorded with "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)", "Tis A Pity She Was A Whore", when the number of songs we knew was four when the album was released.
I'd like to say that the rest, "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days," are also very good songs.
When we look at it whole, it's based on a very strong musical structure, but it's just as sincere, as if it were made with momentary feelings like "Blackstar"...
Neither death nor a "calculation with the past" album...
It's just a real "last" album.
"The End" is the writing of a musical life that is a masterpiece from beginning to end.
Turkey targeted in Sultanahmet attack
German Federal Police Department President Holger Münch made statements about the attack on Sultanahmet Square on Tuesday, which killed 10 German citizens in a program he attended on the German first channel ARD.
Münch said the target of the attack was Turkey, not German citizens.
"I've got 400 people watching"
However, Münch said that the Sultanahmet attack did not change the danger of terrorism in Germany, saying, "We are still under a threat that needs to be taken seriously."
There was a decrease in the number of people who went to Syria to join ISIS from Germany, Münch said, noting that many returned from the war zones.
"There are almost 400 dangerous people we shouldn't be keeping in custody right now," Münch said, noting that this is a major challenge for security units.
In Europe, Münch demanded improved coordination between police agencies and closer communication.
Turkish officials have stated that the live bomb that orchestrated the Sultanahmet attack is a Syrian citizen and a member of ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere has stated that the identity of the attacker has not yet been identified.
Sezen Aksu bids farewell to scenes
Sezen Aksu, who decorated his 40th year with a concert series, captivated his loved ones with his "Years of Sezen" concert at the Volkswagen Arena last night.

25 cents increase in bread in Ankara and Istanbul
In Ankara, 250 grams of bread increased by 25 cents as of yesterday, starting to be sold for 1 TL.
On rumours that there would be "a raise to bread" before the new year, especially in December, Minister of Food, Agriculture and Livestock Faruk Çelik and Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci made statements saying, "There is no problem."
However, in the capital city of Ankara, 250 grams of bread was sold for $1 yesterday.
Halil İbrahim Balcı, the President of the Turkish Bakers Federation on the 25-cent increase to bread, said, "The tariff decision was not made, it began to be implemented 2 years ago," and added:
"This was a tariff decision taken two years ago."
The Union of Chambers of Crafts established this tariff two years ago.
A price applied throughout Turkey.
So a new raise was applied and there was no price increase.
But because of the competition, trades in some areas in Ankara were selling for 75 cents.
In some areas, it was already sold for $1.
The tradesmen who relied on their counter, bread, were not lowering the price. due to the competition, they now have to apply $1.
There is no increase or increase.
They're applying the unimplemented price.
"The kilogram price of bread in the first half of 2016 will certainly not exceed 5 TL and we will complete the year with this price if we don't have too much trouble".
In some parts of Istanbul, bread began to be sold for $1.25.
This time, the terror also bloodied Burkina Faso.
The attack, which targeted a luxury hotel known to be favored by foreigners and United Nations officials in the West African country of Burkina Faso, killed 23 people from 18 different countries.
The North African branch of al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack.
The attack in Burkina Faso took place four days after the terrorist attack by ISIS in Jakarta, Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, with a population of 250 million.
In a bomb-and-gun attack on a busy street with foreign embassies, luxury hotels and stores, on the Starbucks branch and police point during the day, a Canadian and an Indonesian lost their lives.
Indonesian officials said the attackers were inspired by the Paris massacre on November 13.
Frank Garner, a security correspondent for British BBC television, pointed out that this action was part of a frightening trend that has recently manifested itself in many cities around the world.
The United States has also recently been hurt by acts of terrorism.
At the beginning of last December, 14 people were killed in an armed attack by an ISIS-sympathetic couple in San Bernardino, California, United States.
'San Bernardino' attack that rocked the United States
In the wake of the live bomb attack in Sultanahmet, which killed 10 German tourists, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere also recalled that there were terrorist attacks in many parts of the world, saying, "We have had two major attacks in Paris."
If we say that, then terrorism has won...
We used the phrase "without stepping back".
ISIS Drops WhatsApp, Talks to Alrawi App
According to a new report, the terrorist organization is taking advantage of its own chat tool to communicate independently of chat apps such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to Defense One's report, the organization is taking advantage of a new messaging app to text among itself.
This Android app, called "Alrawi", is distributed and installed through an APK file.
The app allows the organization to encrypt between itself and share media.
ISIS's flash move in Iraq
The functionality of the app remains "primitive" in the face of popular apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram, according to Ghost Security Group.
It is unknown for now how powerful the encryption used is.
ISIS had previously conducted all of its communications through the Telegram app, which allowed it to send messages over encrypted connection.
Telegram, however, had revealed the channels that ISIS members were talking about.
Moreover, the U.S. administration is demanding that app developers place backdoors on their applications.
That is why the organization is now beginning to use its own solutions instead of relying on the encryption of WhatsApp and Telegram.
UAE: Iran nuclear satellite to deal

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced on Twitter that he congratulated the removal of sanctions after a nuclear deal between six world countries and Tehran.

How should the semester holiday be evaluated?
We asked Murat Aydin, the education expert-student coach, how should students evaluate the semester break?
The semester break is for students only; it should not be considered rest, entertainment, spending time on television and computer, and so on.
The semester holiday is a very important opportunity to prepare for the new education period and review the past.
The semester holiday, called leisure time, is also an important opportunity for personality development, knowledge, skill, and hobby acquisition.
Make a semester evaluation list.
Write down everything you plan to do and try to implement it.
Make sure you enjoy it and have a very productive semester.
Now let's talk about what a productive semester should be like for fellow students who are primarily preparing for YGS-LYS.
Because the questions that come to us the most from friends preparing for the YGS-LYS exams are: "How should we evaluate this period, solve a lot of questions, or do we have incomplete issues to deal with them?"
To answer both these and to have a productive term, let us first enter our writing with advice to friends who are preparing for the exam.
While the exam preparation process should be a process that starts from the 9th grade under normal circumstances, we are trying to complete it more in the last 1 year, which makes it imperative for us to spend the last year more effectively, efficiently, and more accurately using time.
The senior has to conduct the exam preparation as well as the school's written work together.
Even if the graduate student who has completed the school has taken the exam (YGS-LYS) at least once and has experienced it, the year in which he/she will be re-tested as a graduate student is also critical for him/her.
Because most graduate students and their families consider the 'O' year to be their last chance, which creates greater stress.
Studying is the work that the student does not enjoy, only because he feels compelled, and therefore usually leaves it to the end, but it has become a complete task for the students who make it regular, habituated, and it is always within a plan of what to do.
Now we have a semester off ahead of us, and we need to make the most of it.
And for that, we must have a plan that will allow us to manage time well.
Studying on a Half-Year Vacation:
Everyone must first make a plan that suits their situation.
What was taken care of during the 1st semester, what was missing; it should plan the day, the week, and the 15-day time.
During this period, there must be both subject repeats and question solutions.
At the same time, students who are not lacking much can also complete an average of 1-2 trial exams.
Solve Your Missing Subjects: Research shows that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetting is through repetition.
Students who make too many mistakes, especially from past subjects, should focus on their overall re-work.
Identify your missing topics first and plan for the day, place the topic every day, and make sure you get them done.
This planning will relax you both academically and psychologically.
When placing matters in your plan, make sure they are the ones you make the most mistakes with.
Because in the future, you won't have such a long-term holiday.
Make Question Solutions:
It is as important to solve questions as to repeat the subject.
Because we can only see how much we understand the work we do from the rotations we get through the question we solve.
Don't forget to put in a certain number of questions each day.
The number of questions you will solve can vary according to the work you will do on that day; you may not solve a lot of questions on a day when you are doing a topic-intensive study, but we should still do a certain amount of question-solving work, at least in terms of how much we know about the topic on that day.
Solve Tests:
Another study you're going to do during your half-year vacation should be to solve the trial exams.
Although not all of the topics are finished, you can at least make lesson trial exam solutions.
Let's say you've done a great deal of Turkish lessons; you can solve 40 questions prepared Turkish lessons essays.
And make sure you do some time work while you're doing it.
If you can solve 40 Turkish questions in 60 minutes at first, then your next goal is to be able to solve them in a few minutes less if possible.
Vacation and Hobby Plan:
Vacations, of course, are not just about studying; you should also devote a few days to vacations, recreation, and hobbies.
A holiday period that will only be spent studying will prevent you from being discharged and rested.
Therefore, there must also be special times within your plans that you will set aside for yourself.
Reading books, watching television, surfing the internet can be within your plans, the most important is how much time you will spend.
I'll also have a little advice for friends who say that I haven't had a productive first term.
If my first semester didn't go very well, I couldn't work very hard, and if you think my shortcomings are too much, this semester holiday is a great opportunity for you too.
But first, you have to decide and believe in it.
In the Turkish football superleague, goals were scored between the 76th and 90th minutes at the most during the 2009-2010 season.
Now you answer the question you asked yourself, the game is over, and you're going to the locker room, or the game is still going on, and you've got a lot of minutes to score?
I guess no one wants to say, "We're going to look at next games now," a classic interpretation used by a defeated football team teacher or their players.
All you have to do now is leave the past and look in front of you, not walk, but run.
To sum up what we said:
1) Plan a semester holiday first,
2) Do it again by going over the topics you know,
3) Take care of your missing issues,
4) Make subject reinforcements by solving questions,
5) Solve essay exams,
6) Read a book,
7) Set new goals for the new term,
8) Take time for yourself, your hobbies, and the things you enjoy,
9) Spend time with your family and friends,
10) Take time for social and cultural activities (cinema, sports, theatre, concerts, excursions, picnics, etc.)
'Kervan' has gone a long way
One of the largest 'home' store chains in Turkey, with an average of 45 stores of 1,000 square meters each, Shanasi Demirel, the founder of Kervan, and his son Hasan, have acquired Home Sweet Home, which has 17 stores abroad and 25 in the country.
With the operation recently completed, Kervan also owned 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
Stating that there are still no caravan stores abroad, Shinasi Demirel said, "Now we will continue the larger department store with the caravan, the smaller department store with the Home Sweet Home."
"Kervan will also open abroad," he said.
With the merger of Home Sweet Home, which had a 2015 turnover of $50 million, and Kervan, which was $90 million, a retail chain with a turnover of $140 million, also produced.
The total sales area of Kervan, which has 45 masses in 35 provinces, is 45 thousand square meters.
25 of the stores are owned by the parent company.
There are about 500 jobs in the caravan.
Home Sweet Home has 17 stores abroad in 25 countries, with a total sales area of 6,500 square meters and a staff of 320 people.
Kadir Kalaycıoğlu, Chairman of the Board of Home Sweet Home, who has been producing, exporting and storekeeping with his partner Alev Pakten, stated that they were very pleased with the merger with Kervan and said, "We are Mardin and we entered this sector in 1998."
From the beginning, we would come up with a brand with the support of the Shinasi Beys.
Mr. Shinasi is the 'TRT' of this sector.
So we learned a lot from him.
We even started our first step into retailing when he himself gave us the White Central store.
I was already working with the caravan as a strategic partner, not as a competitor.
"Now there will be a very serious synergy with this merger," he said.
Kalaycıoğlu announced that there are currently 17 stores abroad, including the weight of Home Sweet Home in the Middle East, and they also started exporting to China last month.
"We also opened our first corner in Shanghai."
We agreed on a chain of 200 stores.
"From now on, we will also develop the large department store abroad as a caravan, with the small department store Home Sweet Home," he said.
Poroshenko sells his factory in Russia
Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, who interviewed Liga.net news site on the matter, said the factory was being sold for $200 million.
Moskalevsky said, "Yes, we put the factory up for sale."
"As soon as they sold it, all the real buyers were gone," he said, noting that there were no buyers.
Regarding the price of the firm's factory in Lipetsk, Russia, Moskalevsky said, "We set it at about $200 million."
Roshen, which produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and confectionery a year, is one of the largest producers in the world and belongs to President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine.
Yıldız Holding became Pladis abroad
Yıldız Holding merged global companies operating in the biscuit and chocolate sectors it purchased under the name "Pladis".
The merger, which brought together De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and Ulker brands, spawned a new $5.2 billion food giant, with 26,000 people working.
"Being a global company was our goal from the beginning," said Murat Ülker, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Yıldız Holding at a meeting on the merger of global companies within Yıldız Holding.
Murat Ülker broadcasts 335 million lira sales live from Periscope
Founded 72 years ago, this company is now moving to become a global brand, global company in the world in the biscuit chocolate confectionery business under the name of Yıldız Holding.
During this time, we developed biscuit chocolate confectionery from retail to packaging, real estate, personal care, and various industries.
With 77 factories operating in 14 countries, we are at thousands of sales points with 300 brands.
Ülker said that all Yıldız Holdings constitute "a family of over 50,000 people" and said, "Now as we look at the opportunities in our family, we want to go back and focus on biscuit chocolate confectionery, our main job, and be global in this field; we are reorganizing for it," and described the new structure as follows:
The life story of Sabri Bey, Ülker's father
We're reassessing our company structure, reorganizing it.
We divided the world into regions.
And we had our CEOs share these areas.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tütüncü, Turkey is in charge of the Middle East, K.Africa and Turkic Republics.
Mohamed Elsarky is responsible for our global Godiva business as well as the Americas and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be in charge of Britain, Continental Europe and Africa.
While Ali Ülker, who I can call a guru of quality and innovation, takes global responsibility in his field, Cem Karakaş will help me manage the business.
China, Russia in part, South East Asia will be the areas we will build and develop.
Murat Ülker sells shares at SAF GYO
Murat Ülker, who continued his words saying, "We promise happiness to the whole world in every bite," said, "Our global company that we set up to make this happen is called Pladis."
"If you say, 'Where did you invent the pladis', there's actually no particular meaning to that name," he said, adding:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
Japanese Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, Süreyya was inspired by the name Pleiades team star, consisting of seven stars in Latin, meaning Ülker.
So we translated Ülker into global.
Ali Ülker, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of Yıldız Holding, stressed and added that they "started to create synergy in innovation" by collaborating with laboratories in different countries:
We have very valuable R&D teams, bringing these teams together to work on an R&D platform to achieve certain synergies so far.
We have 27 R&D centers under the pladis.
The largest of these are in Turkey and the UK.
We have over 300 R&D experts working here.
Synergy studies have already begun to yield their results.
The drop of Digestives (Nibbles) produced in Ülker, which will start exporting to the UK, is produced in Silivri in Ülker's chocolate factory.
Another example of synergy: the brands are different but the products are the same.
By adapting a cracker technology developed in the UK, namely Jacob's Crinklys product, to Turkey in a short time, we have brought a good taste to our country under the name Ülker Krispi Serrated.
Laviva, which we all know well, met with consumers in America today.
Call of Duty series surpasses 250 million
This series, in which Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games carved its name into the game world in gold letters, seems to be a long one to remember.
In particular, the newly announced sales figures prove quite well how legendary we should be.
Activision, which holds the license rights to the series, showed 250 million copies in the number of sales it shared privately at the end of the year.
At the beginning of last year, the company shared the total number of sales of the entire series, and has since managed to sell 75 million Call of Duty games.
And most of that number is undoubtedly Black Ops 3 game, so we wouldn't be wrong.
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was once again elected President
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was re-elected as president at the Ordinary Assembly.
Kılıçdaroğlu, who received the vote of 990 of the 1,238 delegates who voted, became the president who came back.
Of the votes cast, 248 were deemed invalid.
Following the announcement of the result, the party cheered.
The CHP had a total of 275 delegates.
The convention completed its work to convene on Sunday at 10:00 p.m.
Kılıçdaroğlu said in brief at the convention:
We'd like games to be played here, to be sung.
But the point where we're coming is not heartwarming.
There is an unmanageable reality of Turkey.
The atmosphere that forms overshadows all of this.
The reason for the pessimistic painting is those who run the country.
As CHP people, we are against terrorism no matter where it comes from, no matter how it comes.
Terror is a crime of humanity, and terrorists should never be forgiven.
The fight against terrorism is done with reason, with knowledge, with wisdom.
Of course let's fight, we want no one to bleed.
How is it different from the photos in Syria, Lebanon, the photos in the Southeast?
As they sat at the table, they made serious mistakes.
It is the power that is responsible for the blood flowing, the tears, all those who die.
In 2002, they surrendered the country with zero terror, today there is a Turkey returning to the bloodbath.
Who is responsible for these?
Our City, the taxi driver in Diyarbakir?
What is Turkey paying for?
We will sincerely attend meetings about changing the laws of the coup, relaying our thoughts.
We will not allow a country to be built on anyone's personal views.
I say, "Come, let's change the thrashing spirit."
Because the intellectuals of this country have announced their thoughts, their homes are being raided and taken into custody in the early morning.
There are aspects that we don't agree with, but people should be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictator says, "He who eats the bread of the state and is hostile to the state".
So I want to ask him, why didn't they think when those who ate the bread of the state and took advantage of all the resources of the state robbed the state?
CHP is the party that brings the biggest changes to this country.
Together we will prepare for the fourth great revolution.
Whatever the cost, we will surely bring a free democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can detain us, no matter what they do, no matter how heavy the cost, the CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I'm giving you a clear call, Davutoglu.
Don't hide behind the law of coup, the man hiding didn't throw the coup mentality out of his head.
You gave the man who gave you the memorandum an outstanding service medal.
What impact are you talking about?
He's totally bent on fooling the public.
Party officials listed the other 3 revolutions as follows: the 1st major revolution was put to an end to the reign and the establishment of the Republic; the 2nd major revolution was to go from the one-party period to the multi-party period in the time of Inonu; the 3rd revolution was to move to social democracy with Bülent Ecevit...
The President has qualifications, duties.
Article 103 states that the president has an oath.
We know how important the concept of honor and honor is in this society.
If a person comes out and makes that promise, he will fulfill it to his death.
Because honor and honor are indisputable to us.
The man who is a dictator, what honor and honor mean to you.
What do you understand about honor and honor, and why did you make that oath?
What does honor and honor mean to you?
I want to know that.
In the religious man, the concept of honor and honor is the crown.
Their intention is not to abolish the law of the coup, but to arbitrate the law of the coup.
They don't want the presidential system.
How to chair; the bossy presidential system.
Why do you reject the Ottoman parliamentary system?
Anyone who commands a person will do what is necessary.
Is Parliamentarian working healthy in Turkey?
No, it doesn't.
If we bring libertarian democracy, the system works.
They call it a coup, but they have strengthened the coup law.
İzmir MP Mustafa Balbay, who announced his candidacy for the presidency, was unable to participate in the race because he was unable to collect the signatures of the 128 delegates required for the nomination.
Balbay, who was able to collect 92 signatures, said, "I can't run on current terms."
In the convention hall, MPs had seats reserved for the party assembly (PM), the central executive board (MYK), and the members of the honor board, while former CHP Leader Deniz Baykal sat in the stands with the party members.
Istanbul MP Gülay Backupci, instead of sitting in the place reserved for MPs, came early and sat next to the place reserved for President Kılıçdaroğlu.
Yalova MP Muharrem İnce's meeting with Kılıçdaroglu was also one of the issues discussed in the convention lobby.
İnce explained that he himself did not accept that he had been offered PM membership.
However, from the general center sources came the claim that the request for a meeting came from İnce and that PM membership was not recommended.
İnce posted on Twitter, "No one can learn from these central sources, the content of the meeting from Istanbul MP Ali Özcan".
Özcan also said, "How can I know about the two people's meeting?"
He was content to say, "He's gone."
Kılıçdaroğlu often applauded the press.
On the first day of the usual "Community of Democracy, Change and Fraternity" the party assembly (PM) was marked by the backstages.
Kılıçdaroğlu went to his home after the convention speech and started working for the PM list.
While preparing Kılıçdaroğlu's key list for 100 people, it was learned from current MYK members that he would be on the list by telephone calling 13 MYK members other than Seyhan Erdoğdu, who did not apply for PM by announcing that he did not want to take part in the administration.
Kılıçdaroglu is said to be able to point to another narrowed list, as well as the PM key list of 100 people.
In the 21-point conclusion declaration adopted unanimously in the CHP Congress, the removal of the shrews on the European Local Government Specification, which was raised by the DTK's autonomy discussions, was demanded to increase the share of authority in the locality.
The declaration also included the goals of "ending the order of the party state", "establishing a law state that can be respected and accountable".
Selçuk Özdağ, Vice President of the Congress AK Party, followed by Idris Baluken of the HDP, Ruhsar Demirel of the MHP.
The AK Party Özdağ and the AK Party delegation left the hall after Kılıçdaroglu harshly criticised President Erdoğan.
"I saw that it missed the dose of criticism, I couldn't accept it," Özdağ said.
A banner in Kurdish, Turkish and English with photographs of imprisoned journalists Can Dündar and Erdem Gül inscribed "How do you get out if I don't burn?" and a banner in Kurdish, Turkish and English was noted.
The convention began in the morning with the songs Group Comment and Ahmet Kaya.
The message sent by Türkan Elçi, wife of Diyarbakır Bar President Tahir Elçi, who lost his life in the armed attack, received great applause.
Berkin Elvan's mother Gülsüm and his father Sami Elvan also attended the convention.
Kılıçdaroğlu said that no matter what price they had to pay, they would claim democracy to its "death" was the most applauded part of the speech.
So far, the CHP has gathered 52 conventions, including 34 regulars and 18 extraordinarys, and gathered its 53rd major convention at Ankara Arena yesterday.
Attendance was high.
There were more than 15,000 CHP members in the 12,000-seat hall.
However, there was no enthusiasm due to the crowd.
The most exciting moment was when Kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu.
The excitement continued while the Kılıçdaroğlu couple greeted the hall.
There was no trace of discipline seen at AK Party conventions in the hall.
Even as Kılıçdaroğlu spoke, there was great activity in the arena's field area.
Obviously, CHP members who wanted to enter the Party Assembly preferred to seek support by telling party administrators and journalists about themselves.
A CHP executive tried to explain that this was not a bad situation, saying, "It's better than having party parties who are extras like Korea or party meetings in the Soviet Union lined up like ropes and sitting still."
The CHP convention differs from the AK Party or MHP conventions.
Only the presidents speak at these parties.
In the CHP, the convention becomes a platform where party problems are also discussed.
When the number of party members who wanted to speak at yesterday's convention was high, the President of the Court, Murat Karayalçın, had trouble adjusting the time.
While there was the expression "The country is going badly" in faces and languages, there was also a distance to the comments "You can change the course with the painting that will come out of this hall."
While all CHP members said, "Something must be done," there was no coherent and strong answer to the question "What to do?"
This had a huge impact on the fact that there would be no elections in the next four years.
When Kılıçdaroğlu came to the stand, we journalists waited for the answer to the question "What to do".
Kılıçdaroğlu first answered the question "What's happening?"
He pointed out the issue of imprisoned journalists, what has been done to academics due to the declaration, what has happened in the Southeast, the impasse that foreign policy has entered.
He has long responded to "Anatolian legends" about his party, such as "the party without religion" about the CHP, "supports the coups", "is the party of the elitists".
When it came to the "what to do" stage, he tried to put forth "strategy" instead of talking about concrete steps.
He stressed that all of these problems can be overcome with more justice with stronger democracy.
He also made a promise on behalf of the CHP and said, "We will work at any cost until we bring democracy."
"We will fight to the death for democracy," he said.
One last note; it should also be remembered that the CHP has dealt with the issue of "organization" as of the 53rd convention, and is now able to convene without problems.
Meanwhile, the card was printed for 900 journalists who were said to follow the convention, but the participation of journalists in the hall was not at that level.
Representatives of media outlets in Ankara were also not as keen on following the convention as they were at the AK Party conventions.
Özgürmetim was asked for life
The indictment against 7 defendants, 3 of whom were arrested by the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor's Office, was accepted by the 4th Heavy Penal Court.
The indictment said statements were made under the name of "self-government" in some districts and neighborhoods of Diyarbakir, Istanbul, Şırnak, Mardin, Muş, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Ağrı on the instructions and calls of senior executives of the PKK/KCK terrorist organization.
The indictment, which was expressed as calling for illegal action from the organization's ringleaders and youth and women's structures, stated that there was an increase in bomb-bombed, long-barreled gun and rocket-launched assaults against security forces, public institutions and organizations, citizens' homes, businesses and vehicles in the districts of Sur, Bağlar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro.
Dissidents clash with ISIS Our police station was shot
The recent clashes between Syria's Düden, Kara Mezra Büciddin, and the Fatah Army, which opposition groups have formed in Kara Köprülü Village, across the Yavuzlu Village of Kilis, continue to intensify.
The sound of guns and mortars fired during the clashes between ISIS and the opposition, which ran close to the border, is also heard by Turkey.
Smoke rising from areas where frequent explosions occurred was visible to the naked eye by Turkey, while security forces on the border took intensive precautions with armoured vehicles.
On the other hand, a harassment fire has been fired on the Martyr Mehmet Biryon Police Station near Yavuzlu Village of Kilis from Büciddin Village, which is under the control of ISIS militants.
Then, under the rules of engagement, the soldiers responded to the area where the harassment fire had been opened, with an obscurity and heavy weapons.
Allegedly, Russian warplanes launched an attack on Hamış Village, 17 kilometers from the Turkish border.
Six Syrians injured in air bombardment were brought to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by their relatives.
Lotto rich take their checks
The Robinson couple, who lived in a small house in Munford, Tennessee, worth $150,000, chose to receive a single payment of $328 million (about $1 billion) rather than a total of $528.8 million (1.6 billion tl) over a period of 29 years.
"After all, there is no guarantee of tomorrow," the couple said.
John Robinson, who worked in a chain of stores, and his wife Lisa, who worked as an assistant alongside a dermatologist, said they would be in charge of their business on Monday, although they are now millionaires.
With the money they earn, the couple primarily aims to pay off the mortgage debt and help their relatives.
It was announced that the jackpot was divided into three.
iOS9: how to get new iPhone operating system, Apple update released
By going to the Settings app for the new operating system, you can click "General" and choose "Software Update".
When ready, your phone will give you the option to download and install it.
Some users experienced a problem following this installation and received an error message saying "Software update failed".
To overcome this problem, users are advised to wait for the system to reduce uploading or try and upgrade iTunes from there.
The phone will guide you through the rest of the process.
It could also be deleting apps to make room between this – but Apple has made the update smaller, preventing this from happening, and is using a special tool to reinstall it when the process is over, suggesting some apps to delete it.
It is worth making sure that your phone is charged or next to a charger so that your battery does not run out while the update continues.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update, as the phone may stop halfway through it to stop the update.

At the same time, you need to make sure that you do everything you can to do before you start downloading; if something is wrong, you should try and stop it and protect it. iOS 9 comes with new features such as a smarter personal assistant and new production features for the iPad, as well as tweaks that speed up and fix the operating system.
FedEx's revenues are mixed, financial outlook will drop in 2016
FedEx has reported disappointing results for the past three months, and the cargo giant has reduced its all-year profit forecast due to reduced demand for cargo services and increased costs on ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 season workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx had announced that it would be hiring 50,000 season workers for the holidays.
It dropped about 2.5% in pre-opening operations 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening gong.
FedEx Corp. said earnings were expected to be between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than previous estimates.
Analysts expected $10.84 based on research by FactSet.
An average of 4.9%, which will be valid on January 4th, is likely to rise and decline despite high charges that will start in November in the land transport of heavy or large packages.
Cost cuts, higher revenue, and gains from the growth of e-commerce are still expected to be higher than the previous year, the company said.
President and CEO Fred Smith said the company "performs robustly, especially in manufacturing and global trade, despite poor economic conditions than expected."
Holiday employment plans were announced a day after rival firm UPS, according to which UPS said it plans to receive the same number of extra workers as last year, between 90,000 and 95,000.
During the three-month period ending August 31, FedEx increased its revenue by 6% compared to the previous year, earning $692 million.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, down from an estimate of $2.44 by 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx was hit by a setback in international priority shipping last year, which caused a stagnation of revenue in the Express unit.
However, the explosion in online shopping has raised FedEx Ground Services results.
In the last quarter, ground services revenue increased by 29%, but business revenue was basically stagnant due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
At high labor costs, revenue fell in the cargo business, while the express unit saw high revenue due to high base rates.
In pre-opening transactions about an hour before the opening gong, FedEx stock dropped to $150.15, down $3.85 or 2.5%.
They closed Tuesday at 11% for the year and 17% below the June 11 record level.
In their most anticipated meeting for years, Federal Reserve politicians decided this week that it was time to increase the interest rate once with almost a decade, spending two days around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table.
The two-story meeting room on one wing of the central bank will be a mural of the United States.
The Map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, Women's President of the Fed, and her colleagues place the nation's economic interests above anything else.
The central bank has two mandates from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices here stable.
However, since the Great Depression, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is a third unwritten proxy: the financial balance.
And this third proxy could be the X factor in an unpredictably close decision as to whether the U.S. economy, which will be announced on Thursday, is ready to begin cutting off its unique stimulus support from the near-zero short-term interest rate that has been going on since the end of 2008.
While most data show that the economy is growing solidly, the recent shake-up in global financial markets can already make Fed officers wary of adding vulnerability by raising reference federal funding interest -- even at less than a quarter of a percent.
"Clearly the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist for the brokerage firm, Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they're looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increasing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough justification to wait a little longer," he said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, and this, in itself, leads to fluctuations in the financial markets.
Half of the economists Bloomberg interviewed recently expected an interest increase this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to remain on hold, with only the main indicator showing a 30% chance of an increase.
This could signal a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, if policymakers do not mitigate its impact by promising that another increase may be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industry index averaged 228.89 points or a 1.4% increase to 16,599.85.
Moody's Capital Markets Research Group chief economist John Lonski said, "The increase was triggered by the expectation that Fed policymakers would keep the rate steady this week."
"It would be surprising if the Fed would increase the rates right now," he said.
If Fed executives had decided to do so, they would "have to take a long year to calm down the financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts have suggested that a rate increase could calm financial markets due to the removal of the fog curtain on when the Fed will take action.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on its way to increasing the rate by 0.25% this month; this would be a small step in strengthening the recovery of the United States, as the monetary conditions slowly narrowed.
Yellen said that despite liberals' complaints about the need for a more economical process, he expects this year's rate increase in spring and early summer.
Although the pace of job creation declined in August, growth in the labor market was steady this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in seven years, nearing what the Fed considered to be full employment.
Wage increases showed signs of improvement.
And although inflation continues to be below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed politicians said the temporary impact of sharply declining oil prices was a major cause.
Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said the economy "can handle higher rates and needs it despite the tightness in the labor market."
However, financial markets all over the world began to shake after China went into devaluation in its currency at the end of last month.
The Dow Jones industry index average fell as low as 16% in May due to fears that a slowing Chinese economy would bring global growth down.
When the market was now almost 10% below Dow's high in May, it somehow bounced back.
For Fed policymakers, market turmoil makes it even more complicated to calculate when the interest rate will be increased.
Stephen D. Oliner, senior research partner at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official, said: "They may have narrowed down a bit in this meeting over the past few weeks with the lack of information about the lack of information about the financial markets in the Chinese economy."
He now predicts that they will wait at least another month to better manage these effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts will be on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on for further development in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's primary concerns, so it should not be a factor in the technical process of making a profit.
In reality, however, the Fed became the world's monetary authority.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
Until then, the only clue from President Ben S. Bernanke was that in 2013, the Fed could "reduce" the monetary expansion triggered by market tremors around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected to not only follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bank executives and experts to better read the global economy.
Zachary Karabell, global strategy chief of asset management firm Envestnet Inc., said the decision-making process was "more of a talent than science".
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va. President Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that "the Fed has overreacted in the past to unseen financial market movements linked to economic foundations."
Lacker, a member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee who had the right to vote and pressed for rate increase, cited the 1998-99 resolutions as an example.
"Despite limited identifiable recommendations for U.S. growth," Lacker said, "the financial crisis in Asia has caused the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75% over three meetings."
A year later, Fed officials recovered these cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England rate-setting committee, said, "The Fed should only put financial balance concerns at the forefront during major crises, as in the 2008 market meltdown."
He said the last shakedown didn't come close to this level.
You really don't want to have to be afraid of going to a rate increase because the markets are upset, Peterson said Posen, president of the International Institute of Economics.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers and does not mention financial balance, and I do not think they should act in that direction until that changes.
Do you want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/depo opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Şti.
A wholesale Thai market that also sells to the LAX-C public, often called Thai Costco.
Yeah, that's Chinatown, not Taiwantown.
A market/depo one-stop shop sells a large number of fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Asian and Thai snacks, utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
If you want to buy motor oil, there's even an automotive part.
The store is huge and it could take an hour to get around all its corridors.
If you're hungry in all this shopping, grab food from LAX-C BBQ Eksres.
The inside of the store is next to the food part (good, affordable) vaults, and they have a variety of extraction options.
What does it stock: Do you want something that belongs to Thailand?
It's probably in LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes special Asian and regional Thai spices, fruits, and more.
The meat shelf is very extensive, and so is the fish - the employees behind the counter clean the fish and make fillets, or even fry them if you like.
Most of the store has a large freezer section, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, all ducks, fish, veal blood, fish balls, regional sausages, commercial food, and more.
Who shop: Restaurant owners and cooks, families and individuals.
There are both shopping carts and forklifts in the wide corridors.
Found: Fresh monthong durian right next to the exit stand.
Where: The store is located in the industrial section of Los Angeles between Chinatown and Downtown, a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Park: LAX-C has its own parking lot, sharing it with other stores and restaurants.
Although the store is very busy, parking is not usually difficult to find.
Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Society promotes healthy eating during breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatrics organization SPRS has resorted to a shocking method, including pictures of milk children depicted with descriptions of unhealthy food to try and tell women about the importance of healthy eating during breastfeeding processes.
Human milk has been made up of many types of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which provide babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a healthy immune system.
Due to energy surplus requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake to around 500 calories.
However, according to new research, the food supplement that mothers should take is not limited to calorie intake alone.
According to a new study led by Robert Waterland, Professor of Baylor Medical College, Texas, healthy eating of pregnant women affected the genetic expression of their babies, protecting them against tumor development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy eating has been found to negatively affect the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise continues to excel in ratings despite Nine's efforts to take the lead on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's moves to Canberra in an attempt to overthrow Liberal's leadership failed to provide a ratings increase for Today.
After the fall of Tony Abbott's Malcolm Turnbull, Nine's breakfast show was performed in the national capital.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage in London, was caught between the weekly international series Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance issue doesn't seem to make much difference to Australian viewers, with Sunrise having an average of 397,000 viewers in five capitals, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase in ratings compared to last Tuesday (317,000), but the figure was still behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been catching up with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Sunrise averaged 318,000, compared to 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
To this day of September, Sunrise averaged 349,000, compared to Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more people this morning than parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The big news for Seven was the pale beginning of 800 Words from Erik Thomson, the star of the old Packed to the Rafters.
The new drama about a newly widowed father deciding to move to the seaside in New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive average of 1,219 million.
Critics questioned whether Thomson could run a solo show without Rafters' star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result was a ringing "yes" answer.
Seven's X Factor retained its power with 1,136 million viewers, easily defeating Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven mixed his nightly fortunes with two Follow-Ups-Australia.
The first half hour of the new information contest hosted by Andrew O'Keefe (17:00-17:30) reached an average of 446,000 viewers.
In the second half-hour (17:30-18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win against Eddie Mc Guire's Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday Night Follow-Up Australia's first half-hour averaged 520,000 viewers, while in the second half-hour that number rose to 720,000.
The Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
The follow-up Australia's ratings drop on the second night made Nine think that the Hot Seat would give him the upper hand at 5.30 p.m.
The pursuit was a replacement for the Million Dollar Minutes that didn't give a tooth to Mc Guire's show.

The last three think Single Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
Has the secret been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently revealed who will win the Bachelor.
At the end of Sam Wood's Bachelor program, the woman he would choose remained in great secrecy.
And the three remaining girls are doing their best not to say who took the last rose.
But the day before the three fell in two, if we checked Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski, they might have given us a clue as to who the winner would be.
Sam Wood sealed his mouth until Thursday's final
All three women described in lyrical language why Wood was perfect; they emphasized his humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude, saying why they wanted to be his partner.
But their answer to the question, "If not you, who should take Wood's last rose?" may contain information about who will win The Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best candidate for Wood, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been pretty close since day one.
Jeavons-Fellows said: "From the moment I got home, I felt they were suited to each other by reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy, and that's what I thought throughout the program."
Markoski added, "Sarah is very practical, it's a lot of fun to be around her."
I saw them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel very good and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks that she and Sam Wood are going to be a very good couple.
Mackay said last week's house visit appointments made him think Wood was the "right person".
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized it was definitely not just a game - I'm totally committed to him now," he said.
When asked who Wood could choose without him, he was mysterious.
He said, "I don't know if I can say that."
"I love other girls equally - Snezana and Lana are equal."
The Bachelor airs on Ten on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
First broadcast: Sarah is the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had a variety of options in terms of where he would start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest in him after he moved to the United States, and after last year's impressive open practice day, many other teams approached him.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seems to be a very wise decision.
Some coaches put Hayne on the bench for losing in his performance in the Australian rugby league, as in the 20-3 win against Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula believed this man and gave Hayne another chance, in a play after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula continued to show his true color to the dressing room after the game.
Instead of insulting the rookies in front of the entire team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
Cam Inman, a reporter for the 49ers team, said Hayne was also encouraged by special team co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey, who was advised to forget his fall and consider the next game.
Jarryd Hayne caused the Minnesoa Vikings to score in the first quarter and dropped the ball.
This was not what Hayne and her vast Australian fan base had imagined for their first game in the NFL.
Hayne was seen cursing as he left the field after dropping the ball, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy that he could not think of a worse start for his NFL career in 2DayFM 104.1.
Hayne said, "It was just one of those things, you get upset about the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also reminded Queensland of the 2007 Origin first match with the back pass.
Nevertheless, this was a great experience for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted the pose on Instagram after the game while holding an Australian flag with fans.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodarkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint at a crossing in Siberia.
Khodorkovsky, who openly opposed President Vladimir Putin, was jailed, the oil company Yukos was seized, and his pro-democracy efforts were cut short.
4 Killed as Police Squeeze Plastic Bullets at Protesters in Nepal
On Wednesday, an official reported that four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed as police opened fire on a crowd protesting against the new constitution being proposed in the country.
The incident occurred on Tuesday evening in the city of Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital city of Kathmandu.
County chief official Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that protestors from 1,000 to phase gathered outside a police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used pepper spray and fired into the air before using plastic bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why plastic bullets used because they are a known but generally less lethal alternative resulted in such a high mortality case.
The conflict has been the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group suggest that the proposed new constitution will dilute the political influence of the regions themselves.
The ethnic Tharus group, which wants to form their own state, is also protesting in western Nepal.
At least 40 people have died in violent clashes since August 10, including 11 police officers.
At this date, the four major political parties had agreed to divide the country into regions - an important but uneasiness-making step for the drafting of a new constitution in Nepal, which has been governed by the central state for centuries.
Work on a new constitution had been going on since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake in April, which killed thousands of people.
Legislators worked on draft constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new text would be held by Sunday.
NHC says 60 percent chance of hurricanes south of Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday that a large low pressure system up to 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent more likely to turn into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system was also seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecast center said there was a 60 percent chance of a tropical hurricane occurring in the next two days.
Google launches fundraising matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced a fundraising campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations that have fled war-torn and impoverished countries and helped thousands of refugees to Europe.
Google has announced its fundraising initiative on its blog, with an unexpected personal approach from itself.
Instead of an administrator making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote her own personal experience.
"In addition to hunger, thirst, cold and fear in our journey, there were numerous dark buses and train journeys," he wrote.
I was lucky.
However, as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many families, such as my family, need help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organizations offering aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, the Rescue of Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match the first $5.5 million donation at google.com/refugeerelief until it raised $11 million.
Europe faces the worst refugee crisis since World War II, the biggest reason being the four-year Syrian civil war, which displaced more than 4 million people this year.
He also flees Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which have been damaged by many wars.

Weight loss surgery may help in diabetes patients who are moderately obese
According to a new study, it may take at least five years for obesity surgery to benefit moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
However, it is still too early to tell whether moderately obese diabetes patients live longer than patients who have not undergone surgery following obesity surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote an article in the new study on JAMA surgery and specialized in obesity surgery, "death rates take a long time to manifest themselves."
Weight loss surgeries, otherwise known as bariatric surgery, use a variety of methods to reduce stomach diameter.
These reduce hunger and restrict the body's ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most research has been done on people with advanced obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
BMI, which is measured over the ratio of weight to height, is considered normal from 18.5 to 24.9.
BMI of 25 or over indicates that the person is overweight, while those with BMI of 30 over are considered obese.
You can calculate BMI from the following link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Taiwan's full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital used data from the experiment in which they compared two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and tube gastric surgeries - to treat moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes since 2007.
From the end of the fifth year of the study, the average BMI of those who underwent surgery declined from 31 to 24.5.
In contrast, BMIs of those treated for non-surgical diabetes remained stable around 29.
Diabetes was partially resolved in 36% of those who underwent surgery, and in 28% of those who underwent surgery.
Compared to this in the medically treated group, diabetes was completely resolved in only 1% and partially in only 2%.
In addition, the authors noted that blood pressure control, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the "surgery-treated group".
The researchers also screened the blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, which reflects the blood sugar ratio over time in patients.
Researchers say it is best to keep A1c hemoglobin below 7%.
Postoperatively, A1c hemoglobin decreased from an average of 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the group undergoing medical treatment, it remained stable at around 8 percent.
However, this better "glycemic control" with improved A1c hemoglobin levels did not reduce mortality in these five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues, who conducted the research.
The research team compared the findings at hand to these two types of surgeries.
In the fifth year, the group with bypass surgery, compared to the group with tube stomach surgery, lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), had higher drops in BMI (7.4 to 5.1%), and likewise in A1c hemoglobin (3.1 to 2.1%), and were more likely to decline their diabetes altogether (46.9 to 16.7%).
Although the study showed no clear benefit for post-operative survival at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone of Arizona Medical College-Phoenix said that according to a study conducted in more overweight patients in Sweden, the surgery had valid data that it extended life expectancy.
The Swedish study found that obese patients who had undergone bariatric surgery were 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years than another group who had received more conventional treatment.
Although this new study did not show what the benefits are for the survival of patients with surgery, according to Blackstone, this is relevant and reassuring for those under BMI 35.
This is also the most crucial part of the article, because the group with low BMI says this surgery is safe, there has been no increase in risk of death or renal ailments, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking the weight gain issue seriously as the patient's BMI drops below 27 to 30.
I think we've waited long enough for people to take this matter seriously," he said.
I think it's really hard to reverse this once they've incorporated these genetic changes that make their bodies associated with obesity and diabetes.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama said Europe cannot host all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his 10-day visit to England, during a speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre in Oxford, where he would work on ethical issues.
Under the current circumstances, he claimed that humanity's interests should be put first, rather than the interests of countries or continents.
He also stressed that, although appreciated, the response of countries in Western Europe to the refugee crisis was insufficient in this regard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although he appreciated Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, the Dalai Lama expressed that these were only temporary solutions.
"It's great to take care of a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions; you have to think about how you can bring lasting peace and lasting development to these Muslim countries, basically through education," he stressed.
We need to think about how to reduce deaths in our country.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never been the solution to problems," he added.
In addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also touched on George Bush's actions after the September 11 attacks, saying that the United States' violent responses started a chain of uncontrollable events.
In my letter to President Bush after 9/11, I conveyed my condolences and stated that the way to solve this problem is through non-violent methods.
I know his motives were well-intentioned, but he used force and caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
4 times increase in hand antiseptic swallowing in children over the past 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States have reported an increase of almost 400 percent in wet wipe swallows with high levels of alcohol seen in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of swallowing hand antiseptic in children under the age of 12 reported to the center increased from 3,266 cases in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Lopez told CNN, "Children have become more popular with these kinds of products, and unfortunately there are a percentage of them that will be rushed to the emergency room."
He said some children drank their hand antiseptics on purpose, while others did so in influencing their friends or claiming a social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking antiseptics for the sake of cheap intoxication.
Some adolescents have been reported to mix the antiseptic mixture with alcohol-containing mouthwaters to obtain a harder drink.
Young children may be attracted to antiseptic odors.
"The boy doesn't think it's a bad thing," Lopez said.
Most of the more attractive ones (hand antiseptics) are scented.
There are strawberry, grape, and orange-flavored hand antiseptics that are highly appealing to children.
Hand antiseptics contain anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few shots can cause alcohol poisoning.
According to Dr. Stephen Thornton, head of the Kansas University Hospital poisoning center, to the Kansas City Fox 4 television, "it's highly concentrated alcohol."
You don't leave a few whiskey glasses around, but people do leave these hand antiseptics in the middle, and that's an easy way to get a pretty large amount of alcohol for kids.
Recently, six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who had swallowed only four pinches of strawberry-scented hand antiseptics at his school, was rushed to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol content was 0,179, which, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ER doctor who took care of him at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta, was twice the legal alcohol limit agreed upon in an adult human.
Nhaijah was unable to pronounce the words and could not walk when he arrived in the emergency room.
Rithey reported that because alcohol caused the little girl to fall and shoot her head, doctors kept her under observation overnight in a separate children's hospital, despite any signs of brain trauma.
Anne Ortoria Scott told CNN that it was "very scary".
It could have been lethal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to shorten the contact of antiseptic wipes with the skin and remove it where children could not be reached.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics were found to be associated with death cases.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died from swallowing hand antiseptic, which contained an unnamed toxic substance in its contents.
Health officials had suggested that the substance in question may not be ethyl alcohol, but methyl alcohol, which has a fatal effect, as stated in the list of contents.
In January, three fourth-year students from the north of New York had conspired to "place an anti-bacterial product around the classroom" in order to poison their "evil-hearted" teacher, according to police reports.
Since the teacher was highly allergic to hand antiseptic, he banned it from being used in the classroom.
The police called this plan a "blank attempt" and recommended disciplinary action to the school administration.
You come to Samandira.
Following Fenerbahçe's THY Europa League match against Locomotive Kuban, Robin van Persie met with Udoh, Vesley and Melih at the end of the match.
Van Persie, who had a warm conversation with Udoh, a fan of hers, said, "I'm here to watch you."
And you're gonna watch me practice with your friends.
He said, "I'm waiting for you in Samandira."
The bitch is innocent.
What a humanist I am today.
I want there to be no deaths.
But it's not possible!
This world is cruel.
Felekse bitch.
There is also death in fate.
And pain.
Alien occupation, too.
It's a lightning strike.
Sometimes it's a crashing space shuttle.
Maybe a meteor.
I mean, no deaths.
I mean, let's sign it.
Let's put our reaction in.
Let's say, bitch, what a disaster!
Let our humanity grow.
Shame on the flapper, too.
But he's not ashamed, damn it!
Two weeks ago, they killed Miray İnce in Şırnak's Sur Neighborhood.
He was only 3 months old.
His grandfather was with him.
They killed him too.
What can we say, bitch, they killed Yusuf Yağıcı in Silopi on January 3.
I think he was running away from aliens.
They scanned him while he was looking for a safe place.
He had his wife with him.
The day after that, they killed Melek Alpaydın at the breakfast table in Diyarbakir on Small Transfer Street.
A day or two later, the aliens burned down Sema Çingıllıoğlu Elementary School.
Two days ago, the same aliens attacked another school full of students with firearms.
The students fled from one side to the other.
On 10 January, three bodies of men were left in the neighborhood of Şehit Harun Boy, who were killed as a result of the attacks of bitch paralysis in the mosque of Hossein the Prophet.
Three children were killed in Çınar district of Diyarbakir two days ago.
An unidentified object, with one ton of explosives, was cast into the lives of these little ones.
There have been other deaths, and there have been injuries.
Who's the culprit?
Felek, of course.
Whore angel.
No, it's not the bitch.
Bitch is innocent!
The killer is out there, waving his hand and staring at us and grinning.
Others try to divert attention.
When the killer is right in front of us, instead of pointing at the killer, he creates opportunities for him to escape.
It's a cover for the killer.
He's hiding her.
And after he disappeared, he tells those who came before him that it wasn't really his fault.
The sides of the fight we've had in the last 10 years are very clear.
Someone wants to narrow the circle of fire around us and burn us down.
And someone is trying to stop it, and moreover, put out the fire around us.
Someone's in trouble for destruction, for looting.
Someone's after making, producing.
There are those who have seen us, our region, all kinds of war.
Civil war.
Interstate war.
The battle of sects.
The proxy war.
And they have subcontractors.
Dirty terrorist organizations.
The bloody clowns.
Different names, formats.
Turkey has no choice but to fight each of these.
He fights and therefore has to deal with the evil of them all.
Keep fighting until you're sure of your gifts...
The traitors didn't get skirts, they took refuge in the white cloth.

He came drifting to the door."
He was covered in blood.

Saudi Arabia does not give up TÜBİTAK
Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Fikri Işık stated that the Ballistic Image Analysis and Recognition System (BALISSİKA) developed by the Scientific and Technical Research Agency of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) has been made a new agreement for the second party sale to Saudi Arabia, saying that "The number of BALISTICS to serve in Saudi Arabia will increase from 6 to 14 with the agreement covering the development and installation of the additional 8 systems."
Light made statements on BALISTICA, which was developed by TÜBİTAK Space Technologies Research Institute.
The system's ballistic reviews of weapons, bullet cores and casings captured in the events allowed the system to compare with the data found in the central database, Light said, thus eliminating the problems ballistic experts faced when examining the casing and shell cores.
Light stated that data from different geographical locations and accompanying information could be questioned by hiding together thanks to BALISTICA.
Noting that one of the most important features of BALISTICA is its ability to obtain and display three-dimensional data, which gives more detail and less error, Işık emphasized that the decisions that the ballistics expert will make can be made quickly and the success is greatly increased thanks to the innovations brought about by the system.
BALISTICA exported as part of "SUBA-1 Project"
Noting that BALISTICA met all criteria for success measures and that it received full marks from the Directorate General of Police, Işık noted that the system, established in 10 different regions, especially Ankara, covered all of Turkey.
Işık stated that the system was opened abroad as a result of its success and reminded that BALISTICA was exported as part of the "SUBA-1 Project" with Saudi Arabia and its installation was successfully completed in 6 regions in 2013.
Işık stated that a new agreement had been made for the second party sale of BALISTICA to Saudi Arabia, SUBA-2, which was a continuation of SUBA-1, and that the number of BALISTICA to serve in Saudi Arabia would increase from 6 to 14 with the agreement covering the development and installation of 8 additional systems.
Alligator fossil the size of a bus found
It was reported that the sea crocodile from the prehistoric period had a length of 10 meters and a weight of 3 tons.
Only the length of the skull of the crocodile was measured at 1.6 meters.
The researchers named the species "Machimosaurus rex", and published the findings in Cretaceous Research.
Federico Fanti of the University of Bologna, who was the lead author of the article, said the fossil, which appears to be 130 million years old, was "almost the size of a bus".
Fanti told the Washington Post that the massive saltwater crocodile "was at least at the top of the food chain in a certain area at the time."
Paleontologists have announced that M. rex, thought to be the largest crocodile living at sea, was ambushed and hunted in the lagoons.
The largest freshwater crocodile in history is thought to have been the "Sarcosuchus imperator", which lived 110 million years ago in Africa and South America, and could reach 12 meters in height and 8 tons in weight.
They're all so confused!
Author Ece Temelkuran's first book of 1996, 'All Women Are Confused', was adapted into the theatre under the same name by Aysa Production Theatre.
Deniz Çakır, Zeynep Kankonde, İpek Türktan Kaynak, Kadir Çermik and Şebnem Sönmez are leading the play Selen Uçer.
The play, whose plays 'Poz' and 'Dry Tight' are still in progress, is the first time Uçer has experienced text writing and directing, questioning the confusion in women's minds.
The game met with the audience at the Trump Show Center last week.
The play begins with radio theatre.
In the dark, a voice that takes us back to the past years...
Then the curtain opens.
A woman standing by the window, about to jump down.
It is understood by who he was and why he attempted suicide, by his next-door neighbors interfering.
A MEKTUP LEAVES
'Ebru Uysal', played by Deniz Çakır, is a popular writer.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
There are things in it that have been accumulating since childhood.
His inability to taste fatherly love, his exclusion in student life, his lonely childhood, his mistaken relationships, his feeling that he was not understood; he brought him to this point.
She decided to commit suicide by leaving a letter behind, but she can't jump out the window.
Because 'Perran' (Shebnem Sönmez), the mysterious woman who lives in the opposite apartment with 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde), the babble-and-pure cleaner of the next-door apartment, keeps her in the conversation.
They approach the situation as if it were a normal, normal process.
She gets more nervous and can't concentrate and jump.
When the conversation between the three is attended by the famous singer who cleaned his house, 'Meltem Kaya' (Silk Turktan Kaynak), the event is turning into a whirlwind.
The 'Meltem', which approaches the situation in its own naive and intimate style, can't help singing when it sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt takes on a different dimension when real estate agent 'Murat' (Kadir Cermik) enters the girl's house with a spare key.
The fact that the singer 'Meltem' is giving the press false information is making things crazy.
The game also uses Nazan Öncel's song 'Street Girl'.
BUNALIM GÜLDÜRÜRÜ
Flying for the first time, he managed to keep the pace and fluency of the game.
Zeynep Kankonde and İpek Türk are pulling the comedy load of the game from Source.
The cartoonized types played by the two are able to make the audience laugh, both with their gestures and lines.
Şebnem Sönmez conveys his years of experience very well to the stage, while Deniz Çakır performs convincingly to reflect the depressed mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir Çermik, who mentions his name for his performance in Tolga Çelik's award-winning film 'Sharmaşık', also successfully accompanies these four women.
The one-act play, described as a depression comedy, promises to laugh without confusion.
Of all the good words that come out of the mouth of 'Perran', played mostly by Shebnem Sönmez, those who remain in my mind are: They read twigs; they see twigs, they see.
All the children thought of dying for once to punish their parents, and for some reason they always cried at the end.
She's hanging in the air like an unintelligible joke.
She's always looking for a funny story where she forgets her most important part.
In fact, each story begins with a kind of abandonment.
Sometimes I have to put my hands in my pocket; I can't stand things without pockets.
One is surprised where to put one's hands.
As we are surprised, our hands multiply.
People talk behind what they don't understand, they make up.
A misunderstanding becomes a fact.
All women are confused because they are confused.
Since you can't manage to die, you have a chance to live.
'Long live the unbeliever'
It can be safely consumed at any age
Expert Dietitian Pınar Kural Enç, whose main ingredient is milk, but which is more beneficial than milk, has stated that kefir is one of the foods that it can safely consume at any age, "It is more nutritious than yogurt because it covers protein, essential minerals, and vitamin B."
B1, B12 and K are also rich in vitamins.
Thanks to its calcium and magnesium content, it forms the basis of a healthy nervous system.
It is also a good source of phosphorus.
Kefir, which also has the ability to hold a tok, also does not care about weight.
"The nutritional value is quite high and it's an easy drink to digest," he said.
Every trouble deva
Expert Dietitian Pınar Kural Enç, who explains that children, the elderly, pregnant women and menopausal women can consume kefir without any hesitation, "Kefir is a local drink made in the Caucasus."
But now he's starting to announce his name to Earth.
The secret of youth, the long and healthy elixir of life, kefir is a cure to almost any problem.
One of the most natural ways to keep babies away from metabolic diseases is kefir.
A friend of the intestines
This unique drink, which does not end in counting benefits, is a friend of the intestines.
There are 1.5-2 kilograms of bacteria and fungi in our intestines.
Microorganisms in the digestive system are also divided into two groups because they are beneficial and harmful.
Useful microorganisms are called 'probiotic microorganisms'.
The activities of probiotics have as significant an effect as our liver, and when consumed sufficiently, they inhibit the adhesion and spread of harmful microorganisms in the intestines to the intestinal wall.
Disruption of the balance of healthy microorganisms in the gut causes many diseases.
The health of the digestive tract should be maintained in the correct form of nutrition.
For this, we should definitely consume enough probiotics.
It eliminates these problems in the gut.
Kefir is the most effective probiotic bacteria-containing food, and the beneficial bacteria in it have a huge impact on the strengthening of the intestinal system.
It allows beneficial bacteria and fungi in the gut to multiply and be beneficial in a healthy way.
In regular kefir use, the intestines work, intestinal disorders disappear, bulges decrease, and a healthier digestion is achieved.
A healthy intestinal system means a healthy and disease-free body.
"The kefir, which is also good for conditions such as appetite, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infections and allergies, also helps to get the vitamins and minerals that babies will get from food, so it also plays an important role in infant nutrition," he said.

Mersin İdmanyurdu will appear before Beşiktaş without a coach as Nurullah Sağlu has not yet reached an agreement with a new name.
Letters that inspire little students
A letter was sent to police and soldiers conducting terrorist operations in the area, including Diyarbakır's central Sur district, from children in the west for morale.
Initially Aksaray 75.
The students of Istanbul West Ataşehir Natural Science High School and Eskişehir Ataçag Middle School, the year being Republic Primary School, started work in coordination.
As a result of these studies, students in schools suppressed choreography, in which they formed the lunar star shape into chocolates, and then nearly a thousand letters made poems and paintings.
The children then sent their work to the Diyarbakır Police Department.
The Diyarbakır Police Department set up an exhibition table on the coordinated work of children in the west.
The exhibition, which was established in the new Police Department building, included the work of the students.
The exhibition was visited primarily by the police and citizens operating in the Police Department building.
He emboldened those who read pictures with the letter in which meaningful writings and poems were written from each other.
A student wrote a letter about the operations going on in the Central Sur district, saying in his letter, "Our dear policemen are grateful to you for the sacrifice you have made to protect innocent people in Diyarbakir."
It was learned that the exhibition will last until next week.
She named her daughter 'Angela Merkel'
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been criticized from time to time for her policies towards refugees, was named after another refugee baby.
Memun El Hamza, 26, who escaped the war in Syria and made it to Duisburg, Germany, and his wife, Tema El Havar, 21, called their first child "Angela Merkel".
Speaking to the German press, Tema El Havar said, "We are grateful to be here.

Consumer confidence in the U.S. at seven months' peak
According to university data, UMICH increased by 0.7 points in January compared to the end of December, to 93.3.
With this result, market expectation for the index, which has recorded its highest level since June 2015, was set at 92.9.
Richard Curtin, Michigan Director of Consumer Research, said in a written statement, "Consumer confidence has taken its rise to the fourth month with improved expectations for future economic growth."
"Individual financing expectations have also maintained their highest level since 2007, due to a weakness in inflation overall."
The statement also included the prediction that consumer optimism would now depend on inflation continuing to remain extraordinarily low.
Last year, UMICH recorded its best annual performance since 2004, with an average of 92.9, based on the results of a 50-question survey with at least 500 people each month.
Super Lotto results

Putin licks his spit
Russia is preparing to grant Turkish companies the status of "can do business with Russia" if Turkey cannot afford the services offered by any other means, while the Russian Tour Operators Association has announced that "Russian citizens do not give up on Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which calculated that the severing of existing economic ties with Turkey would cost Russia an additional cost, drafted and released to the Russian government a new "Istisnai situation" bill on Turkey.
According to the draft published in the Russian Federal Regulation, Turkish companies and firms are expected to be allowed to do business with Russia even if necessary.
According to the draft, it is impossible to provide from other sources outside of Turkey, or the products and services of Turkish companies and firms can be used in cases where domestic production in Russia will bring serious additional costs.
Which Turkish-based goods and services will be included in this category will be determined by a mixed commission to be co-founded with other relevant ministries within the Russian Ministry of Economic Development.
Thus, it will be decided which Turkish company will be able to work with Russia by being elected by bureaucrats.
Again, according to the same document, state agencies and private companies in Russia will have to prove to the commission that their job with Turkish partners is not the equivalent.
If the draft is approved and enacted by the Russian government, the registry of the concessioned Turkish companies will also be created in Russia.
The Russian Association of Tour Operators also said yesterday that Russian citizens did not give up on Turkey.
The statement said: "Despite the ban on tour sales and the Russian Foreign Ministry's recommendation not to go to Turkey, our citizens began to look for the formula for organizing their holidays alone."
The number of articles on social networks on the Internet, titled 'the most practical and cheapest way to holiday in Turkey', is growing avalanche.
The most common suggestion is to book hotels online and fly with THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the price of oil, which went below $30, as a "dramatic" development for Russia.
Medvedev said, "It was a very bad surprise for our government, as no one thought that the oil would go down to $30.
At this rate, it seems that it will not be possible for the budget to be fulfilled in its current form," he said.
It's the last month of 2015 that we left behind.
In the wake of the plane crash, Russian President Vladimir Putin announces that economic sanctions will deepen.
In those days, our businessmen trying to go to Russia in the usual order, our THY staff are officially suffering at the border gates.
Turkish goods are being dragged through customs, subject to unimaginable controls.
It's not much longer than a month and Nergun Hacıoğlu from Moscow reports yesterday.
One way or another, the sanctions are softening.
But why?
The reason is simple.
In an age when the economy has become so globalized, closing its borders with the methods of a century ago is no longer an effort to turn political confrontations into economic warfare.
Look, we're still writing stories about how Iran and the economic embargo that has been imposed over the years have been drilled.
Two neighbouring countries, such as Russia and Turkey, that seem to have many friends, but not so much in their essence, are in fact in need of each other.
It's technically impossible to separate these two countries, which fuse with the businessman, the tourist, the entrepreneur, the client, from each other on such a night.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter each other's countries through the chimney.
It is best to hold the political debate at the table and settle there before the sanctions create new Reza Zarrabs (Reza Sarraf).
Without ever infecting the economy...
Attack on hotel in Burkina Faso: 20 dead
At least 20 people were reportedly killed in a car bomb attack on the Splendid Hotel in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso.

The operation, organised by security forces backed by French special forces, said 63 hostages, including Burkina Faso Labour Minister, were rescued, 33 of which were injured.
It is unknown how many hostages and attackers were found in the 147-room hotel.
Eyewitnesses said two bomb-laden vehicles were detonated just outside the Splendid Hotel, which was mostly favored by United Nations personnel and foreigners, with 3-4 masked people entering the hotel.
Suffering news from Sur: 1 martyr
In Sur district, where curfew continues on the 46th day, Ali Bulduk, a police officer who was seriously injured and was taken to Diyarbakir Soldier Hospital as a result of the explosion of a hand-made explosive device that terrorists had trapped yesterday, was martyred despite all the interventions.
It was learned that the city was registered with the Adana population.
Diyarbakirs did not support the terrorist act!
According to the information obtained, at 5 p.m., an action was planned against the operations in front of AZC Plaza, located on Ekincilar Street in the office district of Diyarbakır Yenişehir district.
No one participated at the desired level in the act of sounding, where citizens were invited by leaflets and calls.
Thousands of people participated in earlier actions, while the recent actions were not supported by the citizen.
The group, unable to provide a sufficient majority in front of AZC Plaza, was disbanded before it could carry out its actions because it did not receive support from the citizens of Diyarbakir.
Terrorists burn school in Diyarbakir
According to the information obtained, the incident occurred at 1007th Street in Yunus Emre Mahallesi, central Bağlar district.
A group of masked terrorists who entered Nuri Zekiye Has Middle School around 7:30 p.m., threw the molotofkokteyls and fled after setting the building on fire.
After the building caught fire, citizens in the vicinity reported the situation to the fire department.
The fire department also called the police, asking for security measures to be taken so they could enter the area.
A large number of police teams were dispatched to the area in armored vehicles.
Upon receiving security, fire crews arrived at the school, extinguishing the fire without wrapping the entire building.
Then police teams conducted a crime scene investigation, while multi-faceted work was initiated to capture escaped terrorists.
On the other hand, some policemen who were at the scene were helping journalists to take pictures, while a policeman tried to block journalists who wanted to take pictures.
ATM thieves give away the collar
Police teams affiliated with İzmir Police started work on the complaint that some people had their bank card information copied and withdrew money from their accounts other than their information.
Police determined that the perpetrators of the incident were M.M.G (43) and R.O (32), and determined that the suspects had copied citizens' card information with the help of a "card copying setup" and "mini camera" that they had placed in ATMs in different provinces of Turkey.
The suspects who learned the card passwords were identified as trading with these cards.
With the operation, the indictees were detained.
Teams studying the laptop used by M.M.G. and R.O. captured numerous video recordings of the mini-camera setup set up to intercept passwords of citizens who were processing at ATMs, identifying that the suspects were briefly staying in the provinces where they went to avoid capture.
It was also revealed that the defendants had obtained an unfair profit of $50,000 through their copying on 15 different ATMs in İzmir.
Following their proceedings at the police, the suspects who were referred to the courthouse were arrested.
Officials have warned citizens to regularly check account movements against such incidents and to screen with their hands during password entry at ATMs.
Netherlands: Assad to be tried in The Hague
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Syrian President Bashar Assad should be tried at the International Criminal Court (UCM) in The Hague.
Speaking at a conference in The Hague, Koenders said Assad was responsible for the influx of asylum seekers.
Koenders, who pointed out that as long as Assad is in power, it is not possible for peace to come to Syria, noted:
Assad must be tried at the UCM in The Hague.
A man with so much blood on his hands must answer to the judge.
Assad is also the sole responsible for the influx of asylum seekers we are facing right now.
However, I am aware that Assad will not be leaving his post anytime soon.
This issue needs to be discussed first, and Russia needs its help in this regard.
Whistleful protest against Burak Yilmaz
In the 59th minute of the match against Medicana Sivasspor, when Burak Yılmaz did not reach the pass goal he wanted to give to Sneijder, the protest whistles rose.
Then Burak Yilmaz reacted to the whistlers with a hand gesture.
Reactions then increased, and protest whistles were heard every time the goaltender came to the player's foot.
Then some tribunes supported Burak Yilmaz and protested against supporters who reacted senselessly to their own players.
Then a large part of the stands supported Burak Yilmaz.
Gossip Win: No mismatch in Celtic
While Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place and is going to get over it, Griffith doesn't care about words of dissonance at Celtic.
The struggle of the hearts, SFA's punishment for Neilson, and Warburton's shyness in the face of January signatures that broke the team's unity.
Leader Dons raise points to five with Celtic
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half brought Aberdeen a justifiable win over Hamilton at Pittodrie, giving the Dons the opportunity to make a five-point difference between themselves and Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about words of dissonance
In Celtic, Griffith pushes the rhetoric that creates a rumor of dissonance with the back of his hand, and expresses that he and his teammates are in no way forced under an increased sense of surveillance as they prepare to face the Dutch League Leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of Scottish title racing annoys Dutch de Boer
Ronald de Boer, the Rangers' former midfielder and former international famed player of Dutch football, says that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they are no longer competitive with the Rangers.
De Boer, who is already an Ajax envoy, said: "They don't give away the summaries of Celtic games in the Netherlands anymore, why?"
Because Rangers aren't there anymore.
People don't just talk about Rangers making a comeback.
They're talking about the old Team.
They talk together as they speak from the teams, they take care of it.
Tensions were high in the old Team's games, and it wasn't just the Scots who wanted to watch those games.
I'll make things right, Deila swore.
RONNY acknowledged that Deila Celtic was struggling, but the Norwegian boss said the move would reverse.
The defeat against Malmö and then just after the farewell to the Champions League followed a losing match against the 10-man Aberdeen, now in the lead position by five points on the scoreboard.
However, Deila said, "Celtic has had a bad time in the past, and we're going to make a comeback again."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know the situation is very disappointing and a lot of people are angry or upset about what's going on.
We're in the same situation - but we have to keep going.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes players feel so much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton's January transfers shyness
Despite comments that he set some January transfer targets just a week or two ago, Rangers' boss Mark Warburton is wary of signing, insisting that Ibrox does not want to break the team's unity.
The former Brentford teacher said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players who come in the summer, there is a pre-season in which you can get them used to, we've seen it in our own band this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes it hurts more to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
He targets Celtic Michu over retirement
One of the Swansea forwards, Michu, was tied up with Celtic in the transfer window, and when his contract with the Swans was over, he frustrated the predictions that he might retire.
At the age of 29, he suffered unbearable pain from a problematic ankle for two years and could not find a way to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA battle over Neilson's comments
When Paterson was kicked out of the game, the Hearts were 2-1 in front and then they lost 3-2, reversing everything after the defender's red card- Collum's third red card to be cancelled in eight months.
Neilson doesn't give up on what he's saying, he insists: "I never questioned the union, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths tries to prevent Tynecastle
The obsessed Hibee was scolded when he sang a song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel with offensive lyrics.
The incident occurred in March 2014 at a bar in Edinburgh's Roseburn district, ahead of the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle.
"It was a derby match and the heat of the moment was there," said the offense player, adding: "I can certainly tell you this from now on I'm not going to Tynecastle except to play a game with Celtic.
Tannadice board trusts Dundee United administration - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly still has confidence that the Dundee United board's management team will fix things - but they acknowledge that the fall in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the kids ready to go again," Donnelly said.
Mclness satisfied with "ugly win" over Hamiltona
Derek Mclness admits that thanks to the Aberdeen team's Adam Rooney penalty in the first half, they have to hold on desperately against Hamilton Accos to see Celtic's seventh consecutive win, which brings them to the top of the league five points on the score sheet.
Mclnnes said: "There's no team that wins anything in this form, whether it's trophies or leagues."
Rates remain the same among Scots as unemployment rates rise in the UK
Unemployment remained unchanged in Scotland from May to July with 164,000, while the number of unemployed people across the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
According to the Office of National Statistics (ONS) figures, the unemployment rate in Scotland was higher than 5.5 percent in the UK with 5.9 percent.
In Scotland, on the other hand, employment fell 12,000 in three months, leaving the number of people currently working 2.612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent - an average higher than 73.5 percent in the UK.
"The government's long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy," said Scotland's Minister of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures.
Almost a full year has passed since the date Scotland decided to remain a part of England.
Over these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the Scottish Labour market with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why I'm a Witness of an Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, I'm going to watch a man get killed due to a late legal intervention.
I hope not, but if it does, I'm going to sit in the gallery watching the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary while Richard Glossip is being executed by lethal injection.
He wanted me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made in January through his best friend, and as shocking as I was, I agreed.
As that day approached, I began to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death penalty.
It will offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to watch executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than there are available, a terrible lottery emerges as it is decided who will be elected.
Oklahoma media dropped their seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch it without feeling it.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also developed a relationship with him over the past months as a result of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Officials at the prison said I could not be both a witness and a journalist, so I will not be given a pen and notebook to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of compromising my neutrality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes it, gain access.
I complained to him.
He admitted that he could "make it sound better" but still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip disagrees with me on some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him he could take me off the list of witnesses whenever he wanted.
But he also wants an international reporter to be there to write these.
He thinks that if he dies, spreading it publicly will help the anti-death penalty movement.
A reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware, will be with me.
If you would like to know more about this, please listen to the podcast series I have prepared.
I'm not going to retell all the details here.
I have no definite idea that Richard Glossip is innocent.
What Barry Van Treese did after his death is enough to make him an accomplice.
However, I still believe he is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe there is not enough evidence to legitimize a death sentence.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm going to watch his death from this perspective.
I can't really claim to be objective.
You can look at other reporters there for that.
The impressions you'll get from me will be the impressions you'll get from the follower of the death of a man he likes who was unnecessarily murdered.
After a wet police chase, the man was persuaded from the Canning River.
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry while convincing the man out of the Canning River.
The claim to escape from the police car behind a man from Perth ended in shallow and muddy water, an attempt by a police officer to "gentlely persuade him to come back to shore".
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for trespassing in Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, the man entered the Canning River and tried to escape from the police.
But he couldn't get very far.
"Senior Deputy Commissioner Shandell Castledine, he was standing in the water and saying 'I'm not going out, come get me'."
Police Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiation".
Deputy Superintendent Castledine said, "Sometimes people try funny things to try to escape."
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a lasting example in mind.
In 2006, Cousins left his car to escape alcohol control and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
Their efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired the locals to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon as a joke.
Peter Moody claimed that the stewards snitched on him and threatened him to quit the race.
Peter Moody claimed that Racing Victoria stewards had tried to set up a setup in their own stables last year, threatening him to leave the race immediately.
Racing Victoria targeted stewards and the union department and said they were running a personal campaign against her to exclude Lady Tatai in the final feeding for the race on Wednesday before the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do the best in the races, and told Lidari that when he gave a positive result to the cobalt, he found himself in difficult circumstances where he could not explain.
He said that he had been biting his tongue for 18 months in the face of allegations of snitching, not wanting to "look like a drunken grape".
"I wasn't going to say this, and I covered it up for a long time, but sometimes you get really angry and everything happens all of a sudden," Moody said.
They know this is going on.
Sometimes you react, and you bear the consequences of it, and I will bear the consequences of what I say.
When I go home tonight, I'll sleep well.
I want to go head-to-head and let my bosses know that I'm trying my best for them.
When they start thinking that I didn't do it, it means I shouldn't be the trainer anymore.
I'd think what I'd do with my license if I did.
Previously Moody had detonated a bomb in a rally.com interview accusing the unity department of being in a snitch rush in its own barn.
"Sixteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - I'd call him if asked - and offered to give him a job in my stables in exchange for telling them what I was doing in the stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a con man.
If that's the case, they all need to return their badges because they weren't skilled enough to catch me.
The former president of RVL, Robert Roulston, the new president of RVL, David Moodie, and the current general manager of RVL knew this at the time, and now they know it.
Does that make me think it's becoming personal?
RVL has a series of balls, and perhaps wants to make those outside the handlers responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and throw me out, but I have no doubt what I'm saying will make them think.
But I don't care about anything at the point where I'm coming from, and it makes me sad.
It really upsets me.
I'm going to put pressure on them, I'm going to put a responsibility on them to decide.
I have the support of my family and I walk away.
The long-running cobalt investigation involving Lidari and his disappointment over the subsequent scratch incident put him in a position to say, "Throw my license across the table."
Moody, famous for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race day maintenance rule "ridiculous", stating that it was against the rules for mud or clay porridge to be thrown at the horse's feet.
This is against race rules.
I have to take full responsibility for it."
One of my men accidentally drove the mud to his feet.
He could have taken it last night.
He could have taken it yesterday, which he did.
He took the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month ban for using porridge in race day maintenance as a result of the executives' investigation.
It's a joke.
Those who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We understand we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver arrested for crashing and fleeing in Cobram
Police arrested a man who crashed into a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist had been lifted from the air to Royal Melbourne Hospital on Saturday morning after a car hit him on the Murray Valley Highway due to serious injuries.
Police said the driver who was hit escaped from the scene without helping the injured.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia surrendered to a police station in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping, not helping, and other traffic crimes in an accident.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram remains stable at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds harshly to opponents' wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy described the criticism targeting his own team as an effort to "create an agenda" for NRL's two favorite firsts.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said in the semi-finals in Sydney on Friday night that they allowed the referees to "fight" with their own team in a match that Storm had defeated.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a not-so-faulted reference to Storm after his semi-final match against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling it a "favorite" match for the rugby league and saying that the two Oueenslandsland were "not too big" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended the team's fight and said they only focused on "contact" as they struggled.
Bellamy said it was powered by criticism from two leading teachers to his team because it meant they were concerned that Storm would beat them.
This development continues – I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when they beat us 24-2, Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year round, we've only made a real emphasis on our combat contacts in the last six weeks, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and obviously there's a big team he's been teaching, and he's probably not used to losing with a little shock for himself.
It's also funny that this happened at this time of year.
Bellamy opposed Bennett's idea of "excited football", recalling Bennett's 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons winner by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
It was a matter of comparing our Friday night game with theirs on Saturday night, and how exciting theirs was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 when St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he wouldn't even give me a rat ass.
But now they have a team to play football, which we can call exciting football, and especially their young half with their speed.
This is the kind of football you want to play when you have this type of player.
In 2010, he put this point, now everyone wants to play football in this style - not every team has half-wayers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so it's not possible for them to play that way.
That gives me more confidence because even they talk that way because they're a little shy of playing.
They probably didn't think of us six weeks ago when they went to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Roosters match had a higher score than the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos game was probably a good one, I haven't seen him yet, but what was his score? 16-12?
Our game is 20 to 18, our game has a score of both sides, but is this exciting football?
Or is it exciting to cut down on attacks but not score-bringing attacks?
To me, that's the agenda.
If they're talking about us, that means we'll meet them here in a future phase.
Storm doesn't have this weekend because he won the right to host one of the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks at AAMI Park on Saturday night in his first final match, which went on sale on Tuesday.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail for drug offence
The man who was caught on 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland and faced a possible life sentence was released on bail for $200,000.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic was one of five people captured last month by federal police from South America via Vanuatu, who tracked down the 100 kg. drug from the Solay yacht that was taken to port in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen at a marina meeting with his accomplices during the morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug inside a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of facing a potential life sentence for possession of a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer said that there was no evidence that he had attempted to possess all the drugs, and that he may have been in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was at risk of escape.
They have open links to Serbia.
He travels frequently to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he was staying in the public case.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather offered him $200,000 to release him on bail.
Judge Flanagan said, "It is clear that the $200,000 bail price, after reading the sworn statements of both people, is a real financial burden on them."
However, he warned that this alone was not enough to keep him from going on trial.
Maksimovic was released on bail in exchange for delivering both Australian and Serbian passports, going to the police station every day, and complying with the curfew from 6 to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used girls' phone to lure pedophiles to send images
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request child abuse visuals.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep, logged in to an online messaging service, providing her with a series of inappropriate children's images sent by another user.
The girl then woke up and realized that she didn't have a phone and found her phone in the hands of Hogg, who had fallen asleep.
She looked at him and immediately noticed the disturbing messages before warning her mother.
The police were interested and saw five pictures, then analyzed the computers at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches using terms intended to find inappropriate child pictures.
Hogg later claimed to the officers that the reason he did this was to "manage the pedophiles" on the Internet and "behave and scare like a cop".
Fiscal deputy Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "It's an addiction - an addict who scares people.
He admitted that the calls were made by the computer, but said he did so to act as a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about interviews with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more pictures from them.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said that when he drank, he got sick ideas and wanted to watch rape and murder footage.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she screamed at her mother and she was shaking and crying.
The mother saw inappropriate pictures on the phone and the charges followed.
The girl was interviewed and the girl said the defendant used a computer and a Playstation to look younger than she was.
Hogg, 23, who lives in Ward Road, Dundee, was found guilty of receiving or producing inappropriate children's pictures on June 14th last year, violating bail on January 25th this year, and not attending court on March 24th this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim said Hogg was not included in the category of sexual crimes because it could be argued that there was no "specific sexual element" in this crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the case until October, when the social background study report would be given.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but was placed under probation for other unusual cases.
Sex crimes were registered prior to the date of the conviction.
In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe gave the wrong speech in parliament.
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest leader in Africa, had fallen down the stairs earlier this year as he landed from a podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was tainted by opposition lawmakers' claims that they had received anonymous death threats if they booed him during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
In his address to the nation in parliament last month, he was booed and constantly interrupted - he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), announced that seven opposition politicians had received messages on their mobile phones to avoid disturbing him during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"After Mr. Mugabe's speech is over, the message to the journalists comes from an unseen trick, but its title is 'death'," he said.
He tells members that their immunity is valid within parliament and that immunity does not work when they leave parliament.
The chief spokesman said he was "concerned" by threats against the party's politicians, led by Morgan Tsvangirai.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will end 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in line with efforts to rebuild and reduce costs in corporate service jobs.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year, separating computer and printer businesses from faster-growing company hardware and service operations.
HP reported in a statement that the expected layoffs would result in a cost of around $2.7 billion at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
"These restructuring activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company," said Meg Whitman, president and chief executive officer of HP, who will head the post-secession unit.
"Whitman, Hewlett Packard Company will be smaller and more focused compared to today's HP, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio to help companies transition to the new business style," he said.
As a separate company, we are in a much better position than ever before to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard Corporation's annual revenue will be more than $50 billion and will "focus on offering unrivalled integrated technology solutions" for companies.
Their garage in Palo Alto divides the company called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley" and was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University alumni Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment.
HP is undergoing a major reorganization to deal with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world's largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, is one of the latest moves in the industry to the belief that firm-focused firms perform better.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates had problems with Wilshere's injury ahead of the Dinamo Zagreb match
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's injury occurred in September and that his treatment was planned, with no reason why he should not play at Christmas time.
The best-case scenario already means Wilshere will miss at least four games in England for sure, and given his background, it's unclear if he'll be attending the European Championship next summer.
The most embarrassing part of the last problem is that Wilshere finished strong last season after a separate ankle injury, and then searched for his former sharpness before the season.
This type of injury is not a threat to his career, Wenger said.
This is a fully unhealed bone.
It's not a big deal.
It was just an accident.
This has no connection to his wrists or previous injuries.
From a medical perspective, these may be true, but as Wenger will agree, there is a danger that a mid-season returner will suffer further injury.
There's also an uncomfortable pattern that develops.
According to research by Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshere has had 23 different disorders recorded since its inception six years ago.
In the last five seasons, he played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games.
In the big picture, Arsenal is one of two First League teams that have lost in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08, often due to injury.
Wenger acknowledges the potential for a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believes it will continue to improve on last season's injury record.
"Sometimes you experience a period of injury when you return from an injury, a process in which you want to strengthen your body and win the fight," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to handle it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I trust that, and I believe that he will make the career he deserves.
He has Chelsea to play Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur to play next Wednesday in front of Arsenal, which will start the Champions League fight against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, preparing Wenger for them.
Hictor Belleran and Aaron Ramsey didn't go to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will play.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud, replacing Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I strive to protect the balance and give the players the breath they need," Wenger said.
Despite being an open favourite of Arsenal's F Group, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most retreating stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has not been beaten for 41 games after producing his own "Namağupp" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken Tuesday night by a 3.2 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
This is the 10th tremor this year in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned the necessary lesson from the defeat against Monaco in the Champions League last season, and remains motivated by his distant goal of succeeding in bringing the club its first European Cup victory.
"That motivation is huge," Wenger says.
It's never been like this at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but I have enough experience to be realistic on the other hand.
We're passionate, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about men's friendship
The absence of similar ports in the programs is remarkable, especially at a time when men need more to open up and suicide rates among young men are at a peak of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the biggest cause of male deaths between the ages of 20 and 45; and compared to women, it was three times as high in males.
To draw attention to this problem, the Miserable Campaign Against Life (CALM) declared 2015 as the Year of the Man and aims to oppose the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to accomplish this challenging task.
A study among high school students with more than 2,000 depressive symptoms showed that if the person suffering from this distress had a high number of "healthy-mode" friends, they were twice as likely to recover.
Likewise, for non-depressants, a circle of mentally healthy friends is halving the mental difficulties that may arise.
But, of course, for friendship to work, it has to be accessible first.
In this age of social media-intensive communication; with the focus on style rather than content, it makes immediate response rather than meaningful communication a priority.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look like powerful, fun-loving and successful people, even if in reality it's all about isolation.
Artificial success is spent under the domination of concepts that psychologists call externally driven values; money, image, social status; intrinsic values that have a deeper impact on our mental health – our inner longing for personal development and friendship.
As a billionaire video games creator recently announced, money doesn't buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it turned this focus upside down.
The characters were not defined by their work, but by their personality; and they revealed this by their interactions with their friends.
Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the minutes when they watched football in comfortable chairs, Ross' attachment to Rachel all came from the knowledge that even if they were all in the background to fully explain the men's feelings, they could actually relate to them.
Here's what a helpful employee told me: "...when I was listening to depressed and suicidal people, I saw how even the smallest interactions between friends could make a difference."
Most of the men who contact us are unable to talk to their friends.
The feeling of "going in and out" is very strong, and so is the idea that opening up to others is a sign of weakness."
One of the programs that comes to mind when I suggest long-term coping mechanisms is the Friends series.
He emphasized the small moments of male friendship.
In line with my goal, a foreign status on the phone helps people in times of difficulty, but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you join FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful setting where the scenes are being redesigned to celebrate?
Or, even better, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You have no idea how your friendship will make a difference.

Di Maria makes it easier for PSG to beat Malmö with his goal
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani following his goal for Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made it easier for PSG to beat his opponent on Tuesday with a goal for Swedish team Malmö at the start of the Champions League.
Here's the game report and reactions to the game.
In the game targeted by Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani, Paris Saint-Germain began the Champions League challenge on Tuesday with a 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes stadium.
Di Maria was a PSG player who allowed the French champion to move on in the Champions League with his goal before it was four minutes away, but in the 61st minute they failed to take the chances until Cavani scored a second goal with his head.
Paris, which was in Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, not only to get out of the qualifying groups, but also to improve quarter-final performances in the last three championships.
But the game they played while taking the points was not the best game of the era for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of positions around the penalty area and was later sidelined with him against his hometown team, where he began his glorious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League whether it's indoors or outdoors, winning 2-0 in this regard will create problems for our competitors, and it's a good start to giving a comfortable look behind, even though there are some things we need to improve during the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
Despite the fact that we didn't score one or two more goals, we wanted to win and we won.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after the injury with one of three player changes in a 2-2 match with Bordeaux in the 1st Division over the weekend, but remained in Di Maria's shadow in the fourth minute.
When the Argentine winger was transferred from Manchester United last month, he was seen as the player who would bring PSG up in Europe, and Marco Veratti's pass showed that it was not wrong for those who thought so when he ran behind the Malmö defense and sent Johan Wiland into the nets from the far corner.
However, everyone was disappointed while waiting for PSG to win a major victory.
Malmö, who eliminated Celtic on the playoffs to go on this tour, had nine international players lined up in the field, had a five-man defender and two midfield depth players, a heavy contender.
In the 34th minute, they made very few attacks, except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot, which grazed the pole of the corner that Kevin Trapp was guarding.
On the other hand, the PSG allowed them to slow down the game with unnecessary passes and inefficient last strokes, in the first half Ibrahimovic was unable to make a finishing move in at least five attacks, and when the second half began, he failed to keep up with Cavani's game, causing disappointment.
However, when he came to organize his colleagues, he showed that he was more adept, in the 52nd minute he was Ibrahimovic, who gave the pass of the falsified stroke that Di Maria sent to Wiland's castle.
The second goal came after a full hour, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan player recorded his sixth goal of the season with Maxwell's left-wing head after Ibrahimovic's pass.
Malmö had run out of ideas that he would return to the match, and after an uncounted goal by Ezequiel Lavezzi, who entered the game later, Wiland perfectly recovered David Luiz's shot in the vacant position and did not allow the score to change.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class-higher than his own team, the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December of last year."
Since then, we have only played ball in the Swedish League, which is not on the same level as him.
Teams in the qualifier are not enough.
A hat is removed to Paris.
It was a great match for them.
Glencore generates $2.5 billion in revenue from stock sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore was hit by falling prices of processed goods and sold its shares on Wednesday, as part of a plan to split its debts, earning $2.5 billion.
Glencore, listed in London, announced that it had sold a new stock worth $1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, was severely affected by falling goods prices due to China's economic slowdown causing an increase in demand and confusion in the markets.
The right issue caused Glencore's stock prices to rise on the London stock market early Wednesday morning.
The shares opened 0.69% higher in the FTSE 100 index, rising 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence.
Glencore announced its $2.5 billion share sales plan last week, part of plans to cut the $30 billion debt pile by a third.
The company sold its new stocks for 125 pence per share, which was a 2.4 percent discount as of Tuesday's close.
It sold 1.3 billion shares, equivalent to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns over China's long-standing growth cut iron ore prices roughly in half, while coal, copper and other goods fell between 20 and 40 percent.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
The White House confirmed on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi's first official trip to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a return visit to Barack Obama, who arrived in Beijing last November, the statement said.
Following the bilateral talks of the two heads of state, U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will give a dinner in honor of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan.
The statement also stressed that "President Xi's visit would expand U.S.-China cooperation on regional and global issues as well as the two countries' relations, and would allow President Obama and President Xi to constructively address disputes."
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle before Washington, meeting with some U.S. technology leaders, and then move to New York City to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are also expected to address some controversial issues, including Washington's concerns over allegations that China is conducting cyber espionage activities and China's claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon makes the diversity in filmmaking seem insignificant
Matt Damon opposed African-American filmmaker Effie Brown, saying it was not necessary to be behind the camera during an argument of interest in diversity.
In the HBO-aired Project Greenlight Sunday night episode, Brown interrupted the seasoned actor while stressing that alternative perspectives on the black main character in the project's selected script were needed.
Damon, when we talk about diversity, you don't do it in the cast of the show, you do it in the cast of the film, he claimed.
Shocked, Brown reacted with statements such as, "Wow! Okay, okay," as the Martian film's actor's comments continued.
Damon and Brown were brought together by the brothers Ben Affleck and Farrelly to discuss the show's finalists.
Brown said, "I wanted to make people think about how to treat the Adaptation character, no matter who the director is."
The only black character is a prostitute who was shot by a white conversationalist.
The publisher of Dear White People insisted on their rights to direct the film, asking for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio, who responded that their assignments "could result in the way we don't want to."
After the debate was published, there was an outburst of discontent with Damon's comments on social media.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at cutting, writing, "Since Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, he can explain his diversity about this person as BEYAZ ISE hurts."
After the tweet was posted, it received 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments came at the time when the right race expression was at the forefront of social debate in the media.
After being killed in 2014 by a young white police officer named Michael Brown, the Black Life Matters movement effectively encouraged lawmakers and authorities across the country to stop discrimination against people of color.
In February, singer Prince spoke top-down about the move while promoting Album of the Year nominations at the Grammy Awards.
Albums are still important, he said.
Albums such as books and black lives are still important.
The leaders of the Black Life Matter movement recently issued a statement in response to the question of whether Elisabeth Hasselbeck, a prominent figure in Fox News, should be considered a hate group of the group.
Leaders, the Black Life Matters Network is a love group, he said.
It was recently announced that Damon had been included in the list of show performers, producers and media bosses invited to visit the Pope to discuss the identification of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not yet clear whether he accepted the invitation or met with the Pope.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior program on Monday night, receiving a $1 million prize.
This competition, which entered its seventh season, had never seen a contestant who was able to complete all the stages on the obstacle course.
In the season finale, Caldiero and Geoff Britten made it to the final round.
The last task was to climb a rope of about 20 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete this course in his time, thus becoming the first athlete to complete the challenging 4th stage of the American Ninja Warrior; however, Caldiero finished this course three seconds before him, winning.
Following this tough win, Caldiero spoke to E!News in shock at winning the $1 million grand prize.
Isaac told E! about a huge increase in his salary, saying, "I think it's great to even think about it, I've never made more than $10,000 a year or made a living."
I mean, it just happened... I can't imagine how... the future is unknown.
Producer Kent Weed also discussed the final with The Hollywood Reporter and announced why no awards would be given, though Britten was the first contestant to finish the course.
According to the rules, money is given to the fastest.
"If anyone finishes more than one, they win the award that makes it the fastest," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and it changes lives, he has also won a huge jackpot.
I don't think he had a bad idea about it.
She's very happy that she did what she did.
He received tons of praise from his fans.
He's a great man and a family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff told me, "I'm glad it's Isaac if anyone's going to beat me."
I think Isaac would have thought the same thing if their roles had changed.
The American Ninja Warrior renewed the contract for the eighth season, and filming will begin in Spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season didn't have much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Tigers, once one of baseball's finest, are now the last in the Central League of America.
The Tigers, who reduced their game to mischief, managed to defeat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday by making an excellent game.
The Twins surpassed the half-point difference between the Houston Astros and lost the chance to advance to the American Second League wild-card.
For Detroit, the situation was a return to the good game, which was not seen much during most of the second half of the season, even for one night.
In the words of Brad Ausmus, the Tigers' manager, "no matter what form the victories are all enjoyable."
The Tigers' pitcher, Alfredo Simon, was able to score one point in the sixth and ninth innings, showing early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two strokes.
Simon (13-9) scored six 3/1 innings in a row, three of which were runs.
This was only the third quality start in the last nine rounds.
"I just want to close the year strong," Simon said.
It's hard to waste every game for the backup, so I wanted to dive deep into the game.
Victor Martinez, the Tigers' selected batter, made three hits, and two of them were runs, which was the first RBI he'd won since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hit night since four strikes against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He shook the bat tight," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in hit practice), he was already visibly better at BP, which he continued in the game as well.
At the end of the seventh batting row, the Twins, who had caught three runs, had the best chance to get back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton started the batting sequence by pairing up on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks was only able to make a slow hit, and Simon caught second baseman BrianDozier swinging for BlaineHardy, who was left-handed.
Mauer bravely advanced the only player who could oppose right winger Drew VerHagen in the two - runs against the batter Miguel Sano.
With a pair of runners in the tying run in the second, VerHagen managed to lure third baseman Trevor Plouffe into the double game.
Plouffe's hit on the DP was the 27th time this season in the major league.
After Detroit struggled to secure the ninth place, Mauer crossed the RBI and made a break with the Tigers and approached Bruce Rondon by 5-4.
However, he was captured by Sano in three launches for the right-handed fifth rescue.
Detroit took advantage with the early release of Phil Hughes, who had lost form.
The Tigers won three runs in their first two shots against experienced right-handed players who had been off the field for more than a month due to backburning and had just come out of injury.
"Obviously that's not the game I want to play," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable in the sequel, and I managed to do some pretty good throws in the third round."
When he had a successful shot at the first, Hushes took second baseman Ian Kinsler out of the game.
Right fielder J.D. Martinez was out of play twice, leaving Victor Martinez single in the first run of the match.
Victor Martinez competed with runners to cross the 0-21 band in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos watched with one shot to the right, winning another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out when he wanted to make the third, so the threats were over.
The Tigers added in the second, winning an outside pair from catcher James McCann and a two-out from midfielder Anthony Gose, making the situation 3-0.
Twins manager Paul Molitor said it was a "big hit".
He didn't hit very well, but he threw it in the right place.
The pitch counter made three non-pointing shots until Hughes was replaced by right-handed rescuer A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs and four unscathed hits in six hits.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was out of play due to the pain in his shoulder that he used to throw.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's shoulder surgery in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the disabled list since mid-August due to shoulder pain, was scheduled to begin work on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, he will start with LHP Daniel Norris DL in front of the Twins.
Since the July 30 match for the David Price transfer, Norris and the Tigers are in 1-1 in four games.
He hasn't played since August 20 due to the pain on the right side.
The Tigers and Twins will end their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will compete with Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open up the economy more to the world
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with managing reforms that the economy needed to open up more outside for growth to accelerate.
"China should improve its opening policies by attracting foreign investment expertise," he said at the 16th Central Leading Group meeting to Strengthen General Reforms.
Xi said that while encouraging opening, making new reforms will bring new energy and vitality, creating a new space for economic growth.
The leader group adopted a number of proposals, such as a negative list regulating market access, relaxation in border control policies, encouraging state-owned entities (SOE) to incorporate private capital, and a review of the resident's registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be prepared describing the banned sector and business branches for the investment.
The system will be phase-by-step tested and developed with trial programs.
This is an important move, as it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources and making the market more open by providing a law-based business environment.
The government will also ease their control over the companies, allowing the companies to run their own business.
This statement also states that China will study new models of cross-border economic co-operation in its border regions, and that new mechanisms will come into play to promote regional growth.
More space will be opened to private investment to open up state-controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment, and will offer them better services by protecting the interests of foreign-funded companies," the statement said.
In addition, the requirements for foreigners to receive permanent residential permits or "green cards" will be facilitated by optimizing and putting the application processes on a path.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the rights of lawyers to practice and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement released after the meeting.
Miniature bag now very fashionable-Time Newspaper Fridayertesi Supplement
In the fashion world, the roads turn around and come to the bags.
The recent trend has been that of miniatures...
It is possible to say that small bags attached to older ones are also noted.
They say the little one of everything is beautiful.
I think this view applies to bags as well.
With bags almost the size of a suitcase, the streets could not get enough to step, and suddenly the wind started to blow in the opposite direction, and the bags tended to shrink.
There were already small bags, but this time they came up with reduced cases of large handbags.
These tiny bags can only fit your phone, credit card, and key.
The current, which began with the C-line and the Herms, spread with the Prada.
The transformation of bag fandom into miniature curiosity also affected the emerging models.
Loewe presented the fun bags he prepared this season in two sizes.
Of the panda, polar bear, and elephant-shaped bags, the most elephant-looking ones stand out.
The mini-sizes of the large bags offered by luxury brands with phenomenon names again seem to attract the most red carpet celebrities.
Hermes' "Birkin" bag, which he made for Jane Birkin, is one of the most preferred.
Although Jane Birkin said she didn't want her name to be mentioned with a briefcase in a press release, but that's how she's in the memories now.
Fashion weeks, on the other hand, led to the massization of the mini-bag movement.
Mini bags are also featured on the podiums.
They're quite tiny, so you're unlikely to put them on your arm.
They can be used in cross-states with long straps.
But in the podiums, we've seen those long straps wrapped around the wrists of the models.
Fendi is one of those who took the mini-bag issue to an advanced point.
He has a suggestion for those who can't fit in the mini-bag, but can't give up on them either.
Friends mini-bags to big bags.
How?
By turning mini-bags into bags that can be attached to their elders.
This prominent presentation on the podiums has quickly come to fruition on the street.
Let's see what else we can see!
Skin change in denim
Turkey is at a level to compete with world brands on denim.
He now enriches his experience in production with design.
Loft is one of them.
We see that black models, which used to be a few, are now starting to take their place on the shelves every season.
During the season, when the blacks were so up, the denims found their best friend.
Leather parts and leather detailed designs stand out as the rebel friend of denims.
In general, short models with zippers called "motorbikes" are on the agenda.
The strong air of the skin is again complemented by black pieces; chiffon long blouses, sparkling sweats sports provide a stylish look.
Young people used to wear denim and wanted to get lost in the crowd.
It was thought to save the day.
Young people now want to carry a piece that emphasizes elegance as well as comfort.
In this respect, it is possible to say that Loft correctly understands his target audience with collections and complementary pieces prepared by him.
Small step for Banksy, big step for "global"
The world premiere of "The Art of Banksy" collection, which brings together the works of mysterious street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
The artist's first exhibition of the Global Karaköy building, the product of his 15 years of work, where 85 original works meet for the first time.
Mysterious street artist Bansky's first exhibition in Istanbul opened the previous day at Global Karaköy (Rıhtım Caddesi).
The world-famous artist, who disguised himself and used a smattering name, was of course not at the opening.
We also don't know if he's been to Istanbul.
But according to Steve Lazaridas, curator of the exhibition, Bansky is not even aware of the exhibit.
There's no reason to ask him for permission.
Because Bansky and Lazaridas, the old friend, left after 12 years.
Some of the exhibits were collected from Lazaridas and some from collectors.
But there are issues that Bansky followers are curious about.
What would Banksy think of the exhibition "The Art of Banksy", where 85 of his works were put together?
For example, how would he afford to enter the exhibition by ticket ($35)? What would he say if he saw the small store created at the end of 800 square meters of gallery space?
Would the Red Balloon Girl, the Cleaner, the Rose Now make a noise that their works, which point to the world's scars, are printed on cloth bags, wallets, necklaces?
The fact that the exhibition of an artist with an anarchist spirit, which conceals his identity, has become such a consumption material, is disappointing for Banksy followers.
It's not Banksy's style at all.
But you still get a limited number of tickets before they run out!
For Banksy, the large exhibition "The Art of Banksy" for the small, globalizing world can be seen until April.
They are vile and cruel.
Let them dig ditches.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued his reaction to academics signing the declaration.
Erdoğan said, "These are cruel, they are despicable."
Indeed, those who are with the wrong-doers are unjust.
"They committed the same crime because they were with those who committed the massacre," he said.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who replaced the explosion in Sultanahmet with a carnation, said, "In this action in Sultanahmet Square, which is almost a peace square that smells of history and civilization - and especially right near the German Fountain - I shared our regrets for the death of 10 German friends in such an area, both with the German President and with the German Chancellor.
I would like to extend my condolences to all the German people, first and foremost, to the families of those who died."
"Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination," he said.
Continuing his reaction to the academics who signed the declaration, Erdoğan said: "In the face of all these terrorist incidents, I particularly condemn and strongly condemn the academics who stood up and issued a black statement and signed it under those massacres."
It does not make anyone enlightened that our nation understands who is who much more closely, that is, that it is a professor, an associate professor in front of it.
These are dark people.
They are unjust, they are despicable.
They committed the same crime because they were with those who committed the massacre.
Here's where the incident in Çınar is going to put those puppies, the 3-year-old Mevlude, who was martyred with her father, where are these dark academics going to put him?
How do they fit in their consciences to stand by his murderers?
I invite all the judicial authorities, the senates of the universities, to take office on account of these actions contrary to our constitution and laws.
Yesterday, I said that the steps that had to be taken had to be taken quickly.
Let them do whatever they are going to do there.
Those who want to do politics should do politics in parliament.
But if they can't do it in parliament, they should go dig ditches or go up the mountain.
I speak so clearly and clearly.
TEOG results announced
The results of the Transition from Basic Education to Secondary Education (TEOG) exam, organized by the Ministry of National Education (MEB) for 8th graders, were announced.
The results of the test, held on 25-26 November, were finally revealed.
Weighted Common Exam Score: As part of the Common Exams, the scores taken from the courses that take the exam are multiplied by their weight coefficients.
The value derived from the sum of the multiplications is derived from the periodic weighted common test score for each semester, divided by the weight coefficients of the courses.
The arithmetic average of periodic weighted common exam scores constitutes the weighted common exam score.
The scoring is over 700 full points.
The score is based on placement: 6th, 7th and 8th grade year-end achievement points and 8th grade weighted joint exam points are collected.
The total obtained is divided into two points to the placement.
The score is made out of 500 full points.
Marking the doors of the faculty members
At the Faculty of Communication of Gazi University, a paper was hung on the room door of some of the faculty members saying, "We don't want it in our university that supports the PKK."
Under the paper, the phrase "Gazi Communications" was added.
1128 academics signed a statement entitled 'We will not be a partner in this crime' by the group called 'The Academics Initiative for Peace'; a large number of reaction statements had come to them, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and government officials.
The academics who were investigated because of their signature began to be detained and suspended.
At the Gazi University Faculty of Communication, papers were posted on the room door of some of the lecturers saying, "We don't want it in our university that supports the PKK."
Under the paper, the phrase "Gazi Communication..." was added.
At least 14 people were killed and 27 injured in the tour bus rolling down the rock in the mountainous region of Nagano, Japan.
Police officials said the tour bus, which was taken by young people aged 10-20 who went skiing, crashed near the famous resort town of Karuizawa.
It was recorded that the bus flew over a three-foot rock and overturned on its side.
A total of 41 people were reported on the bus, with the injured being taken to hospitals.

Celine Dion loses wife
The wife of Canadian-born singer Celine Dion, Rene Anglil, has died.
At the age of 12, Anglil discovered Dion's talent and the two married in Montreal in 1994.
Celine Dion had taken a break from her career after Angöllil was diagnosed with cancer in 1999.
'I found 26 people looking for two wrestlers'
Mete Gumurhan's second documentary "Young Pehlivans", 66.
It was the first Turkish documentary selected for the "Generation Lplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival (February 11-21).
Originally from Edirne, but with a production company in the Netherlands, Gumurhan described why and how he shot the documentary, which he completed in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Pehlivans" will compete in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival, which tells the story of six Amasian boarding school students who aim to become world champions in wrestling.
The Young Pehlivans, the first Turkish-made documentary selected for this section, are one of the candidates for the Crystal Bear award.
Although birth growth is Dutch, it was originally a director from Edirne, Mete Gümurhan.
As a child, he heard oil wrestling stories from his grandfather in Turkey, where he came on summer holidays, and watched the competitions.
"There are not just political problems in Turkey."
I wanted to tell the world what else happened in Anatolia.
"For example, wrestling from our ancestral sports is unfortunately not very well known," he wants to meet with six directors and prepare a documentary project.
This project is inconclusive, but one day the magazine news he reads on the plane opens the door to another project to Gümurhan.
'We stayed at the sugar factory'
Mete Gümurhan, who tracks down the writing, which mentions two younger brothers, a 10-11 year old wrestler, goes to Samsun, where the family lives.
The children's father does not allow filming for the documentary.
Gümürhan describes how he overcame this challenge: "I thought about what I could do all day.
Because support from the Ministry of Culture could be withdrawn."
The father was talking about a boarding school in Amasya where the children would go.
That's where I thought of going.
While I was looking for two kids, I ran into 26 kids at school who were interested in wrestling.
In one week, we started preparing for the shoot and finished the permits.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We lodged in the candy factory dormitory."
The biggest challenge the documentary, whose filming was completed in three weeks, brought to the director was language.
"I didn't know what I was going to encounter while I was filming," said Gumurhan, who said that three different languages were spoken on the set where the foreign cinematographer and voice actor worked.
"They didn't speak Turkish either," he says.
The young Pehlivans focus on the story of six of the 26 child wrestlers.
Raised by his grandfather and suffering from weight problems, Baran was unable to attend trainings because he broke his arm, Harun, ambitious but with health problems, Beytullah, the school's cute boy Ümit, the youngest champion Ahmet, and Muhammad who kept the group together...
Mete Gumurhan describes her work with children as: "I left them completely natural."
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
For the first week and a half, I shot in training.
I wanted the kids to pretend they didn't have a camera.
"Luckily they got used to it quickly."
Being elected to Berlin was a surprise.
"We had prepared, but it was a surprise that we were elected to Berlin," Mete Gümurhan said, noting that he did not expect the young Pehlivans to be elected to the Berlin Film Festival.
Young Pehlivans are not a sports documentary, but a production that narrates children's struggles and transmits cross-sections from their lives.
"I wanted to highlight stories of children with family problems being able to cope with their identity-finding efforts and problems," he says.
Support for academics from the art world
Following the declaration of the "Academy Initiative for Peace", the storm went on to investigate and detain academics yesterday, as well as successive statements of support.
The first support came from literary writers, including a large number of famous people.
The previous day, the filmmakers announced their support, and yesterday, the theatricalists announced their support.
"We stand by this honorable meeting of Academicians calling for peace as artists working in the field of theatre and stage-show arts, and we declare that we stand by freedom of expression, equality, right to life and unconditional peace."
"With our conscience and with all our heart, we are adding our voice to the call of academics for negotiation and peace".
More than 400 filmmakers, including Deniz Türkali, Atilla Özdemiroglu, Nadir Sarıbacak, Özcan Alper, Serra Yılmaz, Onur Ünlü, Yesim Ustaoglu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Karaçelik, said "We stand by free thought and art.
But without, but without, if: "We will not be complicit in this crime!"
We stand by the Academics Initiative for Peace," he said.
"We stand by the academics who have been made the target of the lynch campaign," the Film Writers Association (SIAD) said in a statement.
The Academics for Peace Initiative called for peace and negotiation with simultaneous statements they held in Ankara and Istanbul on 11 January, and issued a statement titled "We are not partners in this crime".
The text was signed by 1128 academics at 89 universities, as well as thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar, who had a worldwide reputation for their theories and books.
President Erdoğan and Prime Minister Davutoglu sharply criticized the academics' statement, describing it as "support for terrorism", and Erdoğan called on the institutions to "do their job".
Following this call, while some universities were shutting down academics, the prosecutor's office had launched a resen investigation.
Yesterday, several academics were detained.
I'm a fan, please help!
Hürrem Sultan's red hair, Beren's nose, Justin's hair...
Trying to look like celebrities is considered to be normal to some extent, but it is seen as a psychological disorder after the point where it begins to affect life in its entirety.
'Celebrity wrestling syndrome', aka 'Honoring syndrome', is a newly-spoken subject that has already become an academic subject in the world, while we have it.
It can be considered normal to run to the salons with famous photos of ladies.
But let's not forget the year of 'Hürrem Sultan', when all teenagers are walking around with Irish red hair.
It has already been reported that the 'Beren nose' was the head of the aesthetic operations we left behind in 2015.
The situation is no different on the gentlemen front either.
For a time, dressing up like Polat Alemdar was a jerk.
Now it's just the opposite of a wind blowing through the air.
The Justin Bieber copy was full of lads.
So much so that the unnecessary information we quoted has been read on the Internet thousands of times: "First of all, when you go to the barber, cut the sides of your hair, the over-the-ear and the surrounding area, towards the top of your head."
The lonely sides will be short.
After the cutting process is finished, you should shape your hair with light water.
After the shaping process is finished, fix your hair with the help of spray.
"Justin hair needs to be shaped when it's moist to get it."
All of this brings to mind the newly-spoken 'Celebrity wrestling syndrome', aka 'privileged worship syndrome', which has already become an academic subject in the world.
Fans of celebrities are seen as a ball of love in us.
Artists boast about their fan numbers, about the degree to which they affect them.
Fortunately, psychology doesn't see the situation as that simple.
In particular, it is debated that adolescents decide what to eat and drink, what to listen to, what to wear, according to celebrities.
Excessive adherence to names presented as unattainable is defined as role-modeling mental disorder.
Specialist psychologist Sumeyye Demir admits that Turkey is lagging behind in the work in this field.
However, he also does not miss that families are slowly becoming conscious: "One of the main issues of psychological science is that one is at peace with oneself, that one is at peace with oneself, that one is at peace within one's own identity."
At first, it would not have been taken very seriously if the children had filled their room with posters, dressed as one.
This is changing now.
Her parents feel the need to intervene.
"A passionate commitment to someone is a sign that something is wrong with the young man's life."
Fans riding the emotional roller coaster
Interest in celebrities is non-hazardous, provided it doesn't overdo it.
He proposes to pay attention to symptoms such as not wanting to marry, being jealous of his wife, preferring her clothing, Iron.
We're talking about famous people.
To wonder about them, to be relevant to their lives, is considered to be normal to some extent.
But young people who, in the opinion of the expert psychologist, miss the cantar's knob are in the majority: "When there are no names in the family or the environment to represent the child in the point of virtue, good behavior, that gap is sure to fill."
There aren't always good examples.
"He's copying the negatives, too, kid."
When we consult how to approach them, Sumeyye Demir begins by reminding the celebrity that passion syndrome is more common in adolescence.
Given that adolescents may be self-insecure, the problem is more easily inoculated.
While complaining about the limitations of their families on the one hand, we face young people who expect support and compassion on the other hand: "We are obliged to consider their emotional ups and downs."
New research reveals that they are struggling with changes in their brains.
"It is also natural for a teenager on an emotional roller coaster to be passionately attached to one, to be approached softly."
It is possible to change behavior
Specialist psychologist Sumeyye Demir reminds the parent of their duties to overcome the syndrome of celebrity worship:
Recognize her emotional distress, make sure you're calm before you go into the issue.
Never let him suppress his feelings.
State that you respect his admiration to encourage independence.
Instead of teaching by aggravating, show good example, argue over names that would be role models to him.
Try to take the place of celebrities in our everyday lives together.
Reading books about the real world of celebrities together will help.
Make sure to turn your communication into an adult adult form.
Remember that addiction and motivation use the same pathways in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are an opportunity for change, accept it as it is.
Be sure to get expert support in terms of fanfare.
He admires those who are angry and envied.
At the root of celebrity worship syndrome is the need to expect and seek help from someone else.
Unstoppable love is actually a cry for help.
But unfortunately, that's not how it's perceived.
Moreover, this problem is so widespread that it is not possible to limit it to a country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyaoglu points out that there are certain names in every country that occupy television.
The syndrome mostly manifests itself through attachment to these celebrities: "They are extraordinary."
The general majority does not have their means.
Those who have it don't live by pretending to be them.
Either because they didn't embrace it or because they didn't dare.
"But he continues to watch with anger, who is unable to live as they do, and who cannot."
Those who envy or snort at the nerve are actually no different.
They both have deep admiration.
They make effortless money, they make money on the magazine's agenda.
It's enough to know just to increase the fandom.
Another advice from Specialist Psychologist Sumeyye Demir is to question the reality of those lives at this point.
It should not be overlooked that artificial lives are at stake.
The support of the environment to the person who is passionate about fame, that's where it comes in.
However, the person insists on admitting that the celebrity he is a fan of has troubles like himself.

Should I have gallbladder surgery? - Family - Health News - Zaman Newspaper
Dr. Fevzi Özgönil answers questions in his column in the Square Journal..
I have stone in my gallbladder, and every morning when I wake up, I go to the bathroom 2 or more times a day with abdominal pain after meals.
Could that prevent me from losing weight?
I'm starting to take alkalan right now, but my desire to eat doesn't diminish, I can't lose any weight.
It's been like this since I was a kid.
What should I do?
Do you think I should have gallbladder surgery?
ANSWER: The gallbladder stone is often accompanied by an infection.
These abdominal pain complaints that develop immediately after eating are also a sign that when you eat, you contract the gallbladder and drain the inflamed bile into the intestines.
The intestines, which are disturbed by the inflamed bile, quickly try to expel this bile.
This is why you often go to the bathroom.
Since you often go to the bathroom, what you eat is discarded without digesting, and it's slow for you to lose weight.
I think you need to get it treated.
If you go to a gastro enterologist specialist and the condition I'm saying is detected, you can get rid of it using antibiotics.
But eventually you may also need to have gallbladder surgery.
Alkaline probiotics can reduce but not prevent these complaints.
Whatever happens, I say you keep on using the alkalan probiotic.
Because this is the probiotic powder that is the biggest help for you to weaken.
I eat a lot when I'm stressed.
Teacher, when I'm stressed and angry, I give myself to food and I gain weight.
How can I deal with this?
ANSWER: The desire to overeat actually means that the need for energy cannot be met.
This may be due to undereating or skipping meals in the morning and at noon.
Another reason is that you can't digest the nutrients you eat.
For this, your digestive system needs to work healthily.
If you do not have an ulcer, reflux, or similar problem, the easiest way is to use a good probiotic drug.
You'll see a lot of benefits.
I can't gain weight, doctors don't know why
There is usually information in your corner that is intended to weaken.
It all makes sense to me, too, but my situation is a little different.
I can't get any weight.
Most importantly, I don't know why.
The doctors don't say anything.
ANSWER: The techniques we apply are not just to weaken, but to restore the physiological work of the body to its ideal measures.
Fatness and weakness are the same kind of ailments.
Not being able to lose weight in fat is being treated with the same technique as not being able to gain weight in weakness.
You also become weaker when you eat sweet and pastry foods.
I think you've figured that out by now.
It is also possible for you to be stimulated by carboxypuncture and gain weight with a healthy diet.
So you have gone away from your ideal body by weakening.
Our other patients have also grown fat from their ideal bodies.
You will reach your ideal body by gaining weight, and they will reach you by losing weight.
If the system problem goes away, you gain weight, and they lose weight.
But first, the system needs to function properly.

The boy who feels unworthy gets stuck in 'hate'
There are certain emotions that are innate in the human sense world.
Fear, sadness, happiness, surprise, anger, anxiety...
However, feelings of hatred, hatred, revenge, etc. appear in children over time and as a result of some misbehavior.
Every person needs to be an individual, including childhood.
So whether the parent or his or her social circle respects his or her decisions, he or she wants to be asked about the issues that concern him or her and make him feel valued.
Providing them is the basis for a healthy personality structure.
For example, behaviors such as deciding on the child's place of interest (what to wear, what to eat), ignoring the child's wishes, and instead insisting on their own truth (the child who wants to go to football course is sent to the instrument course) mean not respecting the child's personality.
Since the child, whose self and existence are not respected, has lost his freedom to be 'self', the defense mechanism reveals a sense of anger and hatred to protect him.
"Because anger and hatred are actually the opposite of accepting," psychologist Hilal Arslan says, "the child does not accept what is done to him by hating him, but is trying to tell him and his environment that he is valuable.
The child's refusal to accept the situation and react in this way is a positive development in terms of his personality development, the expert psychologist said, "The hatred here means 'I'm in', it serves the child's purpose to maintain respect for him."
"If the child is allowed to become an individual, hatred will disappear," he says.
The child tries to protect his own self by taking refuge in anger and hatred.
At a young age, both physically and spiritually at the most vulnerable times, the children's parents say that exposure to verbal and emotional violence by their environment can cause negative emotions in the child, Arslan says, with neglect, it will give the child the feeling that his presence is not noticed, that he is invisible.
Arslan goes on to say, "Sometimes it can only be in the way that their emotional needs are not met (like touching your hair, hugging and kissing, not caring for your school or other needs), and sometimes your physical needs (such as food, drinking, housing, school needs, etc."
This is a nurturing attitude that opens the door to neither anger nor hate.
In emotional and verbal violence, there are behaviors such as insulting, insulting, contempt, scolding, giving unnecessary and severe punishments, feeling worthless, shouting.
These behaviors touch a deep place since they are directed towards the child's personality.
"The child either loses self-esteem by accepting them, and spends his life struggling with the feeling that he is worthless, unworthy to be loved, and inadequate, or tries to protect himself by taking refuge in anger and hatred."
His teacher gave Boyko to Beşiktaş!
Dnipro, which Beşiktaş wants to take his two footballers, is preparing for the second half in Antalya Belek.
Technical Director Myron Markevych spoke to the broadcaster about 27-year-old Denys Boyko, who was on the Black and White people's list.
"If two clubs agree, Boyko goes to Beşiktaş and makes him a champion, I will be happy," Markevych said, praising the national net keeper.
Addressing the situation of the 1990 Brazilian stopper Douglas Silva Bacelar, who President Fikret Forest and its staff planned to transfer, the 64-year-old trainer noted that his student, Stuttgart of the Bundesliga, was also interested.
Meanwhile, details of the official offer from River Plate were revealed to Argentine player Jose Sosa of the Black and Whites.
Club president Rodolfo D'Onofrio announced that they had offered $2 million for the seasoned midfield, but Beşiktaş wanted $9 million.
Kartal, who reached the top of the Turkish Cup Group C, turned his eye to the Super League.

Hope couldn't stop passengers from even storming

Attacks on journalists in Turkey become commonplace
Prior to Prime Minister Davutoglu's visit to London next week, 25 famous writers sent a Turkish letter to British Prime Minister Cameron, co-signed.
The PEN member authors asked Cameron to bring up the decline in press and freedom of expression in Turkey in his meeting with Davutoglu.
Britain's leading writers sent a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron asking his counterpart, Ahmet Davutoglu, to bring up the decline in press and freedom of expression issues in Turkey during his visit to London next week.
The 25 authors, including the presidents of the International Union of Writers (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, conveyed their serious concerns about "unprecedented pressures on freedom of expression in Turkey" in the letter.
Journalists, writers, and writers who stated that threats and physical attacks have now become commonplace; the attack on the offices of the Hürriyet Newspaper, the raid on the Koza Silk Media Group, and the seizure, cited as an example.
A letter from PEN-member writers, including Tom Stoppard, Ali Smith, Ian Rankin, as well as Elif Dawn, highlighted the arrests of 3 journalists working for the Vice News agency, the prosecution of other journalists, and the continued arrests against journalists.
The arrest of Can Dündar and Erdem Gül in the case of MIT TIRs has also caused concerns, the authors said, "It is vital that journalists in Turkey perform their original duties in the community, allowing them to limit the public and inform them without censorship."
He noted that attacks on journalists, writers and publishers erode the freedoms of the entire Turkish community.
Due to the widespread "culture of immunity", journalists and writers have been subjected to intimidation methods that lead to physical attacks.
The authors pointed out that the number of Turkish citizens who have been sued for "insulting the president" has increased, and after Erdogan was elected in 2014, he has filed more libel lawsuits than all of his predecessors combined.
Davutoğlu's words remained in the conversation
While it has been underlined that Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who is due to visit London next week, is one of the few government members to express his support for press freedom, these words did not turn into action.
"For this reason, Davutoglu's visit to London constitutes an important opportunity for a clear commitment to freedom of expression in Turkey".
The authors asked Cameron to call on Prime Minister Davutoglu to ensure that his government respects Turkey's obligations on freedom of expression.
25 authors with signatures in the letter:
Monica Ali, Alan Bissett, William Boyd, Chris Brookmyre, Gillian Clarke, Drew Campbell (President of Scotland PEN), Fflur Dafydd, Stevie Davies, Menna Elfyn (President of Wales PEN), Moris Farhi, Maureen Freely, Richard Gwyn, Mark K Haddon, David Hare, Eva Hoffmannoff,
