28-Year-Old Cook Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
The 28-year-old cook, who had recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother said he didn't think there might be someone who might want to hurt him: "Eventually things were going well for him."
The San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office announced Wednesday morning that the body found at Westfield Mall was identified as belonging to Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco Police Department reported that the cause of death was determined to be murder and that investigations were ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as the kitchen department chief in Boston, had taken up his dream job six months earlier and started working as the San Francisco Sons & Daughters kitchen department chief.
The Sons & Daughters official stated that this death had "disappointed" them and that they were "extremely sorry".
"We're a small team working here like a tight family, and he's going to be very missed," the spokesperson said.
In this difficult time, we would like to point out to Frank's family that they are not alone and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially stayed in hostels and said, "Eventually things were going well for him."
Louis Galicia told KGO, "He had hired an apartment and was dating a girl."
Louis Galicia said he didn't think there might be anyone who might want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
The way to bond with the family was always to prepare a plate for us, to cook for us," said Louis Galicia.
He didn't like to get into an argument.
My brother would adapt to any situation.
He said, "As everything else in the world went wrong, it was this unprocessed diamond that shines brightly every day."
People with information were asked to call the SFPD Alert Line at 415-575-4444.
Assistant doctors on strike: calls for new job slowdown
Representatives of assistant doctors asked that their union allow them to slow down work in relation to the dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Assistant Doctors Committee (JDC) called on the general council to support further work slowdown action from the beginning of September.
The JDC said the ministers were unable to address concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted against the contract agreement with BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the voting members.
In a post on Twitter Thursday night, JDC president Ellen McCourt stated that the government was "absolutely silent" about the problems that caused the contract to be rejected.
He said: "In light of this, the JDC Board voted to reject the proposed new contract altogether and called for a formal renegotiation on concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC administration made an official request for the BMA Board to allow a program to increase business slowdown from the beginning of September.
The dispute led assistant doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first total cut in NHS history.
The assistant doctor leader at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned following a rejection vote on the terms of the BMA's proposed contract.
During meetings before 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students voted, BMA told its members that this was a good deal to accept.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt stated that the contract would be implemented to be valid for doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: an 'alliance of incompatibles'?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war waged by words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the showy hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I had the obvious impression that Ankara was the one who wanted this compromise the most.
Handshake, yes.
However, Mr. Putin's smile was rather weak, and his own limited standards could not be said to emit any heat even against it.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly mentioned "good friend" Mr. Putin; five times, according to a report.
I was surprised by the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to the pre-crisis level, but will reach much higher levels.
The next day, in a newspaper here, it was stated that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his excitement showed the opposite.
However, the cold impression that Mr. Putin gave around showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his statement at the opening was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shooting down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Russia's reaction at the time was fierce.
Mr. Putin made a drastic exit, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The resentment was much greater, the opposing side being thought to be friends.
It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, for trust to be truly rebuilt.
Since November, the opinion of the Russian people has also changed.
State-controlled media have targeted Ankara for months, shockingly and aggressively.
Suddenly, the Turks are to blame for everything.
The most serious of these were accusations that senior officials had profited from the illegal oil trade of Mr. Erdogan's family in areas under the control of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
He denied it for sure.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
Ultimately, the reason this meeting took place was because Mr. Putin had received the apology he demanded from President Erdoğan.
Russia might see it as some sort of victory.
The benefits of calling for a ceasefire for Ankara are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs friends after the failed coup that took place last month and almost caused him to be overthrown.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey also affected him greatly.
Economic reasons are also effective.
The sanctions imposed by Russia have hit hard, especially the ban on private flights carrying several million Russian tourists to the coastal areas of Turkey each year.
This number has dropped by almost 90%.
Tour operators and rental companies in Russia were certainly relieved with the continued flights.
They rely on end-of-season density in the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicted a reduction in fruit and vegetable prices by allowing Turkish agricultural products imports again.
To quote a story in the Vedemosti newspaper, "Tourists there, tomatoes here".
However, the visit also had a distinct political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for not finding the response to the coup attempt sufficient.
When the long-suffering anger over the progress of talks on joining the United States is added, Mr. Putin, who wants to take advantage of Turkey's ties with the West and the coldness in between, comes into play.
The Russian leader certainly seems to have gathered sympathy from Ankara due to a call to support elected officials following the coup attempt.
It should not be forgotten that for Moscow itself, which had a radical fear of regime change, this was an inevitable attitude.
This summit, held at this lavish palace by the sea, represents an "alliance of incompatibles" as Russia and Turkey have explained to me by an analyst: the two countries that the West has rejected and behaved badly are joining forces.
Yet despite the appearance of this compromise on display, they are quite different from each other.
One of the most important of these is about Syria: Russia and Turkey support different sides, although Moscow portrays itself as a mediator.
After almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents' statement at a press conference that this was not addressed also supports this.
While Turkey's President clearly avoided answering a question about these differences, Mr. Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on how to determine common ground in Syria.
But after months of blatant hostility - and given the absolute catastrophic potential of NATO member Turkey shooting down and shooting down a Russian fighter - it is certainly a good development for the two leaders to at least start talking.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside Scotland
According to the statement of the chairman of the bank's executive board, the RBS brand will move to the back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be destroyed for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand is associated with the bank's global goals.
Since it almost sank eight years ago, he had to withdraw and give up on them.
During this time, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
This was supported by millions of pounds for sponsorships ranging from the Six Nations rugby championship to the Wimbledon Andy Murray champion.
However, it has now been decided that it would be right for more national brands to stand out.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but no new beginnings will be made.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS will be changed to NatWest, except when they are listed on the central and stock market.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands to take on a much more dominant task for individual banking; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview on a tour of Inverness-shire for customers and staff.
The BBC told Scotland: "Since we will be a bank of more brands from now on, the RBS brand will no longer be our investor brand and the brand in which our staff are employed."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying we have local goals, not global ones anymore.
Each of these brands will stand out in a slightly different way in the community in which it is located, and our staff will work with customers under the name of these brands.
RBS has announced that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations championship and is raising the profile of different brands on sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to move on to the understanding of the brand bank because (we were asking ourselves) how can we make it a better bank for customers?" he said.
If we had stated three years ago that we would be a great bank for our customers and present these brands, I would have found it cynical.
But I think you'll see a lot of changes with the work we're doing and focusing on the needs of customers, not ourselves.
We can reactivate these brands, so I think this is the right time.
Frankie Dettori wins 3,000 times in Newmarket victory with Predilection
Dettori detonated champagne after reaching his 3000th victory with double success at Newmarket
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3000th victory in England at Newmarket on Friday.
At his local track, he reached this milestone, winning his second victory of the night with Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the obstacle-free run.
He follows the footsteps of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
The jockey, who had previously won three titles in Gyayyar, said: "This is a special situation."
I'm so touched that my parents are here, too.
I'm really happy that this is happening in Newmarket, where I started 30 years ago.
It's not an important meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and relieved.
Dettori accepted the cheers by bringing Predilection after victory
In the disabled run, there were two jockeys who reached this milestone: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired jockey Sir Anthony McCoy, who had won 20 times and had over 4300 victories in his record-ridden career.
Lester Piggott, who won the Derby race nine times, has 4493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of our time, and it is not surprising that he reached a milestone that only a few people had reached before him.
A person of style and strength, but the element that makes him outweigh others on the scale is his tactical mindset.
He represents horse racing in an extraordinary way, attracting people to this sport for years with his excitement and charisma.
A few weeks ago, at Epsom, I told Frankie that he might have reached his 6000th victory if it wasn't just a jockey competing on weekends and big races.
To be serious, Frankie has spent most of his 30 years competing in the United Kingdom with victories, which is great to see.
He has a very excited character and this is a very good feature for British racing, but beyond that, he is an outstanding jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this milestone with a leaping, horse-to-horse stroke.
With many moves, from jumping-off races to jumping-downs, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British unhindered running for twenty years.
This was a road full of ups and downs.
In 1996, he survived a plane crash and was banned for failing to comply with the drug ban, although he won many major races, including his famous 'Big Seven' victory in Ascot.
Three years ago, during a return from this six-month suspension, he initially suffered from difficulties, but showed that he had a strong character in the way he needed to wrong those who suspected him and return to his best condition.
And it could go on for a while; Dettori had previously stated that he wanted to continue competing until he was at least 50 years old.
Russian president Putin dismisses private pen Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly sacked his private pen, Sergei Ivanov.
Mr. Ivanov was part of the close circle Mr. Putin had relied on for many years.
The 63-year-old was now commissioned as a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
In a statement from the Kremlin, Mr. Putin was quoted as saying that "Ivanov has decided to end his position as head of the Russian administration", but no reason has been given.
For this position, Mr. Ivanov was assigned Anton Vaino, who has been acting since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the Department of International Relations (MGIMO) of the well-known Moscow State Institute and served in the Tokyo embassy.
He was then interested in the presidential protocol and the administration of government personnel; this is how the statements on the Kremlin website are (in Russian).
Following his appointment, he told Mr. Putin: "Thank you for trusting me."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of the state in terms of law enforcement and oversight of the implementation of the instructions.
On Friday, Mr. Putin announced to the Russian television station that he had asked Mr. Ivanov to step down and recommended Mr. Vaino to succeed him.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a move that amazes Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov had long been working as one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies, and Soviet security forces such as him had served the KGB.
As a private pen, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, both expressed that the private pen had voluntarily withdrawn from office.
However, despite the smiling poses given to the cameras, few here are convinced of this, especially at this time when parliamentary elections are approaching.
Is this a dispute arising from some sort of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
However, the official statement that a person who could become president would suddenly want to direct Russia's environmental policy was met with great suspicion.
The Kremlin website quoted Mr. Ivanov as saying of Mr. Putin: "It is true that I asked you to trust me for four years for the task, in a conversation in early 2012.
Well, apparently I served four years, eight months as a presidential special.
Mr. Ivanov assumed this post in December 2011.
He had previously served as deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security forces, such as Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Mr. Putin was the head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), replacing the KGB, while Mr. Ivanov was acting for him.
When Mr. Putin took power, he cited Ivanov as one of his five most trusted.
Since it was unconstitutional for Mr. Putin to preside in the third term, it was thought that Mr. Ivanov could become president after Mr. Putin's second term.
However, this mission was handed over to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin became prime minister three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical fight last month on the show's set in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produced the series, announced in a joint statement that he had been laid off.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Tuesday, prior to the announcement of the termination.
There were differences and disagreements about creative issues on the set.
In a statement, he said, "I regret the occurrence of such an event."
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios' statement states that detailed information on how to remove Gibson's character from a program that monitors a group of FBI agents will be given at a future date.
The 54-year-old actor, who had previously appeared in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have worked for the past twelve years giving him my heart and soul," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I'd love to stay until the end, but that's not possible anymore.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team and, most importantly, the best supporters a program can have.
The show is expected to return to the screens on September 28 for the twelfth season.
The mystery of fish in the Banff garden
A resident of the Banff area applied for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that these 75 fish could be sandfish transported by sea hose.
Bain, who lives 500 m from the sea, posted the footage on Periscope in hopes that someone would shed light on the emergence of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Pass: Bridge now connected to Fife
The project, worth $1.35 billion, needs to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers combined the north and viaduct of the Queensferry Pass, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between "table fans" that are about to be completed around each of the bridge's three towers.
The cross section of the bridge from Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 46 support cables with 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete.
The project, worth $1.35 billion, needs to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown was one of the first people to visit the facilities today and walk from land to bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Pass.
We all witness engineering on a truly epic scale with this project, which uses over 30,000 tons of concrete to build only this part of the bridge.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge, which closes the gap between the viaduct and the bridge table, it is a delicate study that requires extremely sensitive tolerances for this fit.
Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge tabloid is settled, with concrete casting of the first cut of the tabloid to take place today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire tabloid will be ready to be lifted over the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Gateway and Bridge Contractors project, said: "In all bridge projects, the first closure is always an important milestone.
In this extraordinary project, this closure represents pioneering in civil engineering.
We had to close the gap on the north - or land - side after the final highway tabloid was also placed and connected to the expanding North Tower level.
This was done when the viaduct to the north was pulled south about 700 millimetres.
This was a very large but also very sensitive procedure.
The reason it was large was because the viaduct was 222 meters long, weighed almost 6000 tons, and had to be pulled at a slope of about 3%.
The reason it was sensitive was because the tolerance values the team needed to comply with were very low; only a few millimeters on both sides.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Moelfre Bay rescue team: Three men 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to survive" after falling off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station alerted the crew on Friday at 13:20 a.m. British summer time, after the crew saw the case in Moelfre Bay.
The three men were struggling to swim into a safe area while their boats continued on their own.
"We saw the boat circling them and we were worried," said Moelfre lifeboat control officer.
"Fortunately, he was away with strong winds until we set out for them," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third, 60-year-old man, exhausted, was found holding onto a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all taken to the lifeboat that was headed for shore and brought to the lifeboat station.
Mr Jones said: "The three men who fell into the water are lucky that they are alive and have never been injured.
There was an emergency stop cable on the boat engine, but when the boat capsized, it must have been severed from the person using the boat.
Someone was watching these three men today.
A valuable form of hunting for health and happiness, Pokemon Go
It's really amazing to see how the world has changed.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play games, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, was a situation that many felt sad about over the past decade.
Pokemon Go encourages people to move off the couch.
The time spent looking at screens spread over time to video games and finally smartphones, especially when it was limited to television.
Therefore, it's really great to see that technology and outdoor movement are not mutually exclusive elements.
Of course, in the 90s, I'm talking about Pokemon Go, an app primarily based on characters created for video game (which later turned into cartoons, game cards, and other by-products).
Like many other phenomena of popular culture, this new game had mixed up in early July when it was presented in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.
Subsequently, the presentation was postponed in other countries due to the intense interest that caused overloading on servers.
Over the days, Pokemon reached more users than Go Tinder, and almost the same number as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, players can take their smartphones and go out to look for Pokemon in a GPS-tracked way, and 'take a picture' of what they find (taking a screenshot on the phone) or 'catch' them.
He went off the couch in search of a generation who played the game at a younger age and participated in this madness.
In the United States, the game saw a significant increase in the number of steps a "average" person takes each day.
The Cardiogram, an app developed for the Apple Watch that monitors 35,000 users, recently stated that among the people it follows within two days of the game being presented to the Washington Post, the rate of people who exercise 30 days a day increased from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokemon Go; it can only see raw data at the exercise level.
Most public health campaigns that encouraged people to "take 30 minutes," "get off the couch" and "be active every day" were ignored because most public health messages were boring and were transmitted by people who looked distraught.
But still, the importance of exercise is understated, no matter how much.
People who exercise regularly are less likely to have cancer or depression.
It provides help with issues such as exercise, weight control, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and has a list of advantages that are too long to be listed here.
But the beauty of Pokemon Go is that it takes people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, all three essential elements of health are met: movement, fresh air, and fun with sunlight.
Some people can even make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, there are faceless gamblers who are looking for something to complain about.
And, of course, someone can hit the door when they walk.
What difference does it make?
A major innovation was presented.
Although smartphone apps like Fitbit monitor our movement, it does not offer us any reason to exercise like this game.
The impact of innovation will pass, and use will decrease over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, many games will be released that help people who go hunting through combining apps and virtual reality with real-world activities become more active, fit, and healthy.

Simone Biles wins gold medal in women's gymnastics overall assessment
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic with jumping.
Comfortable on the balance device.
It's amazing on the ground.
Downright perfection at first.
And he's an Olympic champion now.
The 19-year-old American gymnast also finished first in the overall assessment on Thursday, clearly demonstrating the difference between him and the rest of the world at the Olympics.
His total score was 62,198 points, far above Aly Raisman, a silver medalist and friend of the "Last Five" team, and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States performed on the balance instrument on Thursday in the women's artistic gymnastics general evaluation final at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil.
Biles became the fourth and fifth American woman to receive a back-to-back general evaluation award, and announced her name as the best of her generation and perhaps all-time.
When the last total was published, he burst into tears and his long journey to reach this moment was over.
This success has brought the sport to the same level as athletes like Michael Phelps, who can be seen once in every generation that leads to new levels:
Biles spent his last three years as one of the sport's most successful with 15 world championship medals, 10 of which were gold, and a mixture of ambition and precision that allowed 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton to call him "the best gymnast I've ever seen".
A final test was waiting for him in Brazil; this competition was between him and the others in the field rather than between him and the burden of great expectations.
His return to the family home in Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles of the United States, to the left, and Aly Raisman, after receiving gold and silver medals respectively in the general assessment of artistic gymnastics women at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles won on Tuesday, when Martha Karolyi, the national team coordinator who retired the first, served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party.
Although Biles insists on never looking forward in his long run towards the summit, this is not entirely true.
The part of the ground exercise routine, which includes the iconic flip pass, was prepared with Latin music that would fully adapt to the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a child and discovered by Boorman's mother on a trip to a gym where Aimee Boorman coached, became a force.
He hasn't lost any of the overall reviews since the summer of 2013; this is a winning streak that Biles must continue as long as he wants.
Although Mustafina took the lead in two rotations, this was temporary.
The balance instrument and ground exercises Biles had won the world championship had not yet been done.
He took the lead with 15,433 points in the balance instrument and crowned it with 15,933 points in ground exercise as well.
While Raisman waited for the final score, he graciously hugged her, and as Biles' vision for a scribbling notebook once came true, tears appeared around the glowing red, white and blue eye makeup.
Raisman's performance was like a rematch of the performance four years ago, when he shared fourth place but later lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans called "grandmother", had taken the lead.
From time to time, he sent a kiss to the crowd after an exercise where he overcame a seemingly suspicious comeback.
For the 19-year-old Bilis, his much-shared tweet earlier this week can now be said to have a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial killer case, listening to music in car
In Phoenix's first serial killer case in ten years, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot while talking in the car and listening to music, according to police reports released on Thursday.
Authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on a driveway on June 12.
The report states that the gunman fired eight shots with a pistol while standing on the passenger side of the car and drove away with another vehicle.
Police say these three murders did not appear to be robbery because the attacker did not receive the adult victims' handbags or $2,900 in cash.
Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Howard, a spokesman for the Phoenix police, said the shooting led investigators to examine whether this was linked to the previous four attacks.
In a four-month period, a total of seven people were killed and two injured in nine attacks in predominantly Spanish-origin neighborhoods.
Earlier this month, Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO, "This happened in the residential area in front of a house."
The suspect is thought to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in a model in the late 1990s, a black BMW in a model in the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers refused to disclose evidence that allowed them to conclude that the attacks were related to the same killer and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was hospitalized for his injuries and subsequently died.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for these people to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting that targeted an empty truck half an hour before the three murders.
Researchers found shell casings, pulled a bullet out of a seat, and also detected bullet particles in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old microcephaly patient: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, his toys, and, of course, his mother.
Unlike his peers, however, Edmund has microcephaly, a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did not know existed during her pregnancy.
When you first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't ask for that.
Of course that's not true, of course you want it."
He and his wife, Vincent, were told Edmund might never know them or even survive.
Some doctors went so far as to propose that he be admitted to the nursing home.
"My first reaction was to say that I didn't think people were doing it anymore," Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund was unable to sit or crawl upright until he was three years old and still cannot speak.
However, he himself is slowly reaching some turning points.
He can walk and ride a bicycle with help.
He also likes to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund made up to say, "Please sing to me."
Picciuto told CBS News, "We're teaching him sign language."
But it's not sign language as we know it, it says Edmund made up his own markings.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different conditions; a genetic condition such as Edmund may be present and may be caused by infections caused by viruses such as measles and Zika during pregnancy.
Symptoms and the course of the disease can vary greatly.
It's too early to tell how the lives of people with Zika infection will be affected.
Picciuto recalls the emotional burden created by the uncertainty of his future.
I was constantly asking what would happen.
What happens?
And he still doesn't know it.
In fact, I haven't asked a question about the course of the disease in quite a long time, since I didn't expect anyone to actually tell me.
However, Picciuto is in a position to offer hopeful advice for the mothers of babies who are born with a birth apology due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain and floods in Louisiana, Mississippi mobilize rescue teams
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected by Saturday.
The National Weather Services reported that flooding occurred in numerous rivers in northeastern Louisiana and south of Mississippi, which posed widespread flooding hazard following heavy rain flow.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and support for neighborhoods affected by the situation was on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests had been made for high water vehicles, boats and trenches.
Steele stated that a ton of trenches had been requested for the Tangipahoa Quarter alone.
A flood watch will be performed in most of southern Louisiana by Saturday.
Weather services stated that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rainfall could fall on the area in a statement.
In South Alabama, there was a flood watch on Saturday, as rain continued in the Mobile area.
Record levels are expected to be reached during the week in the Comete River near Baton Rouge, both in Louisiana, and the Amite River near Denham Springs.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also stated that the flooding in Ascension Neighborhood was a threat, as the hail rivers would be slow to flow into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, located just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, had already reached the highest level measured at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescuers continue to rescue people from flooding in the Amite and Wilkinson accidents in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the waters from Beaver Creek, normally 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly during the night.
He testified that another half-son, who was sitting nearby, had warned him.
"We woke up and the water kept coming," Hansford said.
It was coming all the way to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that it was the highest he had ever seen in the creek during the 48 years he lived here.
Hansford stated that he and his family members were disabled and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said he rescued all three of the emergency workers in a large, military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they took refuge on Friday.
Krautmann stated that as heavy rains continued, floods "spread rapidly" and authorities were considering issuing an evacuation order.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said the floor has been highly saturated since Wednesday.
Authorities said that heavy rains and flooded streets gave rise to the need for the rescue of Tangipahoa Neighborhood residents and for schools to be vacationed in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a female city councillor in Tangipahoa said 200 houses were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but these are now flooded.
Neighborhood Commissioner Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by rising waters.
Shelters were opened for evacuees in the town of Amite and in the city of Hammond.
"When the waters begin to retreat, they will be allowed to return home," he said.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa Neighborhood, almost two dozen streets were closed due to rising waters, and trenches were offered to be taken by residents trying to keep the water away from their homes and businesses.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's chief executive.
This seems to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison Accident Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said the rain was continuing steadily along the Gulf Coast.
Several homes were reported to have flooded on Tuesday, but there have been no reports so far for Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
Townson said, "I've seen water where I've never seen water before," and added, "and there's still rain."
Mahaj Brown, 6, whose body was pierced by bullets, survived the Philadelphia attack
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second incident in the city this week when a 6-year-old boy was shot.
CBS identified Mahaj Brown as his grandmother and grandfather for Philadelphia.
His grandmother and grandfather Brown stated that there were multiple gunshot wounds to his body in areas including the groin area, leg, arm, and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was brought to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, explained to the station, "She suffered so much, her tiny body was pierced with bullets."
I can't believe it.
He was listed among those who maintained his son's critical condition at the hospital and underwent some surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He would start freshman year at the local elementary school.
Brown was among the four people shot in the Germantown area.
Two men were shot, two at 29 and one at 32.
CBS Philadelphia said one of the 29-year-old men's condition was critical, while the other two victims' condition was stable.
The station reported that the child was found shot in the front seat of a car, along with one of the 29-year-old men who were in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured was an assailant.
Investigators have testified to CBS Philadelphia that multiple gunmen may have fired at each other.
The scene was full of shell casings in the style of assault weapons belonging to different assault weapons.
It looks like it was definitely a long-term shootout.
There were hives on the street and on both sides of the sidewalk.
This suggests that multiple gunmen were present and both were active," Philadelphia Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple homes and vehicles in the area were also damaged.
No arrests were made, and police were reported to have examined the security cameras.
A six-year-old girl was shot in the arm with an accident bullet while playing outside her home in the West Oak neighborhood on Tuesday.
He's in recovery, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
The reason we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie is because
That's what I called this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team, and there's more than one reason.
First of all, I have participated in all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been more dominant.
Second: This team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspire many girls of different ethnic backgrounds.
The structure of this team, brought together by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally showing a similar look to America.
It also strengthens the presence of black and Latino women at the top levels of this sport.
Over the past four years, the first female gymnast has always been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
It's a powerful thing.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America supported him.
Simone Biles, now the world's three World Championships, will be able to witness Douglas and Laurie Hernandez's extraordinary performances of their unexpected but ingenious gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win a gold medal in the women's overall assessment.
And his teammate Aly Raisman also won a silver medal.
We recognize the best times in this sport, but this does not seem to be the case in gymnastics courses across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison to take part in the Olympic teams.
The reason they are "The Last Five" is that there will only be four gymnasts on the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi will coach.
In reality, however, gymnastics is a fairly costly sport and gymnasts primarily work in private gymnastics clubs that are supported by the education, travel, jersey, competition, hotel fees (for teachers, gymnasts and families) and many other fees paid by parents.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburban neighborhoods that can support these businesses.
These clubs are the only place where gymnasts can be trained and require a costly and long-term commitment for the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's coach Maggie Haney have trained these athletes since they started gymnastics.
For countless young girls affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, we do not offer communities more affordable and accessible gymnastics training.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my establishments, we provided free and low-cost gymnastics training to over 15,000 youth (primarily black and Hispanic) in the city, based in Harlem, and coached both national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (where I grew up) to offer quality gymnastics training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this wonderful Olympic sport.
Gymnastics improves the strength, flexibility, and coordination of the body and provides mentally rigorous working, discipline, and determination characteristics.
This combination offers long-term advantages in terms of health, success at school and at work.
What will lead thousands of young girls to gymnastics will be the inspiration for this team, and it's a great thing.
Participation in sports activities is especially important for girls.
We're going through some really exciting times.
Thank you for bringing the gold medal to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison as an Olympic team, showing the "Power of Girls" clearly and motivating many young girls with different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected, assistant doctors decided to continue the strikes.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after consensus was reached on the improved contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors participating in the vote voted against.
In July, Mr Hunt announced his plans to impose sanctions on the contract, stating that the NHS was "no one's property" and that any further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first group of assistant doctors was put into the new contract, which included changes in their work practices at night and at weekends to improve care outside of normal hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA's assistant doctors committee, said in a statement last night: "Asistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract; in particular, they feel that this will trigger the current labor crisis and that there is no equal attitude towards all doctors."
Progress needs to be made in this process, which is only eight weeks before the first group of doctors can be transferred to the new contract, and time is running out.
BMA's efforts to resolve the dispute by talking were met with government reluctance to interact and, in some cases, deafening silence.
This is an improvement despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift sanctions, and listen to assistant doctors' concerns."
Assistant doctors make it clear that they are prepared to increase work slowdown actions if they do not.
In the final strike at the end of April, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were postponed, with nurses and counselors having to replace doctors on the strike line.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after an agreement was reached with the British Medical Association officials on the improved contract.
BMA wants improvement in weekend fees for 54,000 assistant doctors on the contract issue.
NHS Employers executive board executive Daniel Mortimer urged resident doctors not to implement any strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "The strike does not solve anything, but it does create pressure on teams and services that are already busy, causing anxiety, discomfort and distress for patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have continued our discussions with the Assistant Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other officials, have approached their concerns regarding the Watcher's Mission and Reporting in a positive manner.
Employers were hopeful that maintaining positive communication with regard to key issues – such as distribution, educational flexibility, additional education for those who are taking a break from their careers, educational costs, mutual understanding of the curriculum, educational reasoned leave, and gender pay gap in medicine – would be a sign that employers were taken seriously by the UK Ministry of Medical Education and Health in November, February, and May in line with the agreements reached with the BMA.
Medication that can eliminate the danger of a heart attack at a cost of 2 per day
Thousands of heart attack sufferers will be able to take advantage of a daily cost-effective drug, after authorities recommend giving it to more people for longer periods of time.
Preventing clotting, ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurring seizures for people with heart disease.
The drug was administered for 12 months following a heart attack and reduced the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS observer, NICE, recommended that it be given to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS observer, NICE, has suggested that it be given to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, around 140,000 people in the UK have a heart attack, with one-fourth of them having another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fatty substances to form plaques on the artery walls.
If your plaque breaks down, this can cause a heart attack by causing a blood clot and blocking blood to the heart.
And if the clot gets out of place, it will move forward in the blood stream, causing a stroke if it blocks the flow of blood to the brain.
People who have had a previous crisis are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, created by UK firm AstraZeneca under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by reducing the likelihood of clots.
The NICE manual draft, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticegrelor for 12 months and then administered 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology assessment center, said: "Although effective secondary prevention treatments are available, up to a quarter of those who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke, and often the consequences are devastating."
Fear of relapse can have a very negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that the use of ticagrelor in conjunction with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks and strokes in people who have previously had a heart attack.
With the temporary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased to have increased the treatment options available to the thousands who are waiting to take advantage of it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor is limited to more than three years – primarily the risk of bleeding – the manual draft does not recommend treatment after this period.
PC culture boosts vote corruption in Muslim regions
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was removed from office due to corruption following a government report last year.
As the devastating government report presented today shows, the culture of political correctness has caused widespread suffrage in Muslim communities to be ignored.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles rebuked the police, election observers, and municipal court for ignoring evidence of electoral misconduct due to "excessive sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former community secretary and today's anti-corruption tsar said that voters' intimidation on religious grounds is at such a bad level that police should be allowed to strip outside voting booths in order to protect frightened voters.
He suggested that voters keep their identities with them to prove their identity at the time of their vote.
In the current case, it is enough for the voter to say his name and address.
The report even recommends that permanent ink be applied to the finger during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said that those who report should be better protected.
He called for better access to the Press on board papers and decisions of informal committees or working groups.
"This aims not only to provide protection against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with this," he said.
The report was prepared under instructions from Downing Street following Tower Hamlets' vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that after repeated corruption and illegal practices, mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office.
The court found that Rahman "abstained shamelessly" the Muslim community's religious feelings and silenced those who criticized him on charges of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman "executed his campaign on the basis that it was a religious duty for Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 games were questionable, or the result of using fake IDs, i.e. voting as if it were someone else.
Sir Eric testified that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He specifically warned of corruption in voting by mail - where it was alleged that the older individuals of the Muslim community were putting pressure on the candidate of their choice to vote.
Sir Eric made some suggestions for the regulation of the voting system, including having identification with people to prove who they are.
His report included the following statements: "There has been evidence that some ethnic minority communities have been pressured to vote for their valued individuals, especially women and young people, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin, in accordance with the will of the elderly.
"There were concerns that state institutions were ignoring such behavior because of "political correctness" based on ethnic origin and extreme sensitivity to religion."
Sir Eric proposed 50 proposals for the regulation of the system, including preventing political activists from processing voting documents by mail for the purpose of "voting gathering".
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for tightening of registration controls to prevent the election register from being used for immigration and welfare fraud.
Consideration of the option of requiring voters to show identification before voting.
Permanent ink application to one's fingers after voting to prevent any person from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on a person's nationality to determine eligibility to vote.
Implementing a three-year limitation on requests for automatic mail voting.
Prohibition of political campaign officials and activists from processing ballots sent by completed mail and envelopes of ballots sent by mail.
Giving the police the authority to strip around voting booths.
Amendment of the law to facilitate the charge of scaring people under the Public Representation Act 1983.
Illegalization of taking photographs in voting booths.
In voting booths (except Wales), only English is required to be spoken.
Strengthening the training staff receive on the sanctioning of the rule that voters enter the cabinet alone.
Sir Eric harshly criticized the Police Service, saying it was "interesting" that no charges were made in the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court has ruled that there is no place to charge Lutfur Rahman and his representative with repeated corruption and illegal activities," he said.
On a series of grounds, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - according to the nature of the criminal evidence.
He also criticized the municipal palace's ineffectual "holy marking controls" in election registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Tower Hamlets' court order last year was a warning alert.
Although our nation has the pride of forming the mother of parliaments, the spread of these worrying and secret electoral corruption and rejection by some institutions can undermine this good reputation.
Being crazy for Kate's biker-like and other famous likes of the Rio Olympic Players
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is not the only athlete to stand out for his resemblance to celebrities as he competes for the gold medal this summer; at least that's what social media thinks.
Therefore, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces we've seen on our screens, FEMAIL has prepared a list of Olympic athletes who look more like Hollywood celebrities than like them.
Hunter and wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's likeness on the bike track, many in the online environment have shown that an archer can be as identical to Leonardo DiCaprio as a twin.
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison waved Twitter after his photos were revealed demonstrating his resemblance to the star of the film Money Hunter.
And the archer noticed this craze on social media and admitted that he had been told since childhood that he looked like Leo.
Brady told the Huffington Post: 'I don't think there's much resemblance except for hair and beard.'
'He's a handsome man, so I think that's a compliment.'
One of London 2012's most popular comparisons, and undoubtedly even more notable this year, is the incredible resemblance of British long jumper Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina was described as being one-of-a-kind to Cuban-American artist Gloria Estefan, with her large and meaningful looking eyes.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee's star Matthew Morrison for years.
Change: This user refers to Nathan's Start movie star as an 'athletic version'
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have long been compared to each other because of their lush eyebrows and the similarity of their lips.
While the Russian team's silver medal swimmer has the same bronze skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, fans say that Nathan Adrian of the US Team 'looks like an athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt'.
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter's star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not alone: A Twitter user was very pleased that other people noticed the similarity as well.
One theory left in the air: This user thinks there may be a reason behind this pair being similar in appearance.
A Twitter user carried his happiness to this site, "that the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are like twins."
In reality, the American football star and actress who plays for Dexter have similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's almost identical smile, with another gold medalist, Gabby Douglas, and the big smiles of Gabrielle Union, the star of the film Youth Fire.
CBC Olympic announcer apologises for Chinese swimmer's comment that he 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth in the 4x200 m free race angered those watching CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize for comments by one of its announcers that the 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer had 'disappeared like a bad smell' and 'died like a pig' in the race.
Spiker Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was turned off when the women began explaining their own ideas in the 4x200 m free relay final.
MacDonald, who had been included in the CBC's announcer team to add 'color', was heard saying: 'The 14-year-old little Chinese guy screwed up hard, baby'.
He was overexcited, wiped away like a bad smell, and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
China Swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) finished the second leg of the relay for 1:57.79, allowing the Canadian Taylor Rack to close the gap with China by 1.61 seconds.
Canadian audiences quickly moved after being stunned by the tone and language used.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say that the 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig?????'
Idiot, he didn't realize he was still on the air.'
China's Ai Yanhan was described in the 4 x 200 m Free Flag Race as: 'The 14-year-old little Chinese man is badly screwed, baby.'
On Twitter, criticisms were posted about Byron MacDonald quite harshly and quickly, and many of them were of a nature to report him.
Twitter users couldn't help themselves when they heard how insensitive Byron Macdonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all look racist. #midebunausea.
Shortly after, Scott Russel, who continued CBC's broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize for the comment given to the broadcast regarding the swim race.'
These were truly unfortunately chosen words, and we are sorry that such an event had taken place."
CBC has had to apologize at least 90 more times to people tweeting in response to the comment.
Scott Russel, another announcer, was forced to apologize on MacDonald's behalf.
CBC then copied and pasted this apology to over 90 Twitter users who reported complaints about MacDonald's comments.
The network issued a statement, quickly apologizing.
We would like to express our sincere regret that these statements have been made and that they have been published.
Last night, we quickly apologized to our followers on the air, on our viewers, on social media as well.
We would like to explain that Byron's comments were not about the swimmer's personality, but about his performance.
However, these were highly inappropriate and unfortunately chosen words, and Byron is deeply saddened by what he says.
On Thursday, in the afternoon, MacDonald also apologized on the air and attempted to defend his remarks, saying he did not want to commit a personal attack.
He said on CBC's Olympic broadcast, "I want to apologize for a comment I made last night after the women's flag race."
'I wasn't referring to the swimmer's personality, I was referring to his performance.'
'There's no need to say too much, I didn't mean to be disrespectful, and I'm very sorry.'
Primark client hurls anger at woman who tries desperate underwear in the middle of store
Customers didn't know what to do when a woman took off her clothes to try panties on the store floor in the middle of Primark.
Worse, she looked at how this looked in her own right, took it off and put it back on the shelf.
He continued to look and then tried four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The place where the woman tried the panties before putting them back on the shelf was the Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children who was in the store at the time, stated that after trying the mysterious woman's underwear, she was "redressed and left the store without buying anything".
He said: 'People couldn't believe their eyes.'
He stood in the middle of the store and took a pair of pantyhose from the window, took off his pantyhose and pants and put them on.
'He didn't try to look for a special place to do it, he stood in the middle with all his disrespect.'
'Everyone was looking at him when he was taking the powder out, and it seemed he didn't like the panties because he put them back on the shelf.'
She tried three more laundry until she decided she didn't like anything, and then re-dressed and left the store.
'He didn't seem to care who was watching him, and he didn't think about the person who would buy the panties he tried on later.'
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in the town, said: 'How disgusting to think that someone else is going to take a pair of uncleaned panties that someone else is wearing and go home.'
This happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: 'I think the staff took off the sale by finding the clothes after she came out, which is a good thing.'
'When I get a new pair of panties and go home, it would be really bad to think that someone else is wearing them and coming to me without washing them.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of what happened at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.'
The related product has been removed from the sale.
How to protect yourself against armed attacks with Krav Maga
The outside world is quite dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can help you be safer.
We met with Rhon Mizrachi, the chief master of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to learn how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the situation against the robber.
Mizrachi says that when you are approached from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn your face and see the attacker and 'empty the fire line'.
Then you will hold the gun between your forearm and your shoulder and hit it in the face with your empty elbow.
Then, when you kneel in his groin, the attacker's pain will double, and at this stage, he will turn the gun around and take it from his hand, and the gun will be pointed at him, with the barrel of the gun and the rear part remaining above, hitting him in the face.
When the gunman approaches from the front, a similar technique is applied; you pull your body from the line of fire, grasp the gun, and turn it in such a way that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, by putting your weight on the gun, you punch the attacker in the chest area, turn the gun around and take it from him, and point the gun at him.
Does that sound all-girl?
Check out the video to see how Mizrachi did it.
However, remember that if you are not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid every robbery is to give your money to the robber.
Traveler Ian Wright drove his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe for his travel guide
The British traveler licked some of the dirtiest and most disgusting parts of Europe, undergoing a serious test of his immune system and his gag reflex.
The presenter and travel writer, Ian Wright of Suffolk (51), drove his tongue to a Euro bill, a Piccadilly Circus handrail, a flush button of a train toilet, and a pay phone in Russia to prove the strength of the immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what kind of work he was involved in.
However, the experiment, which would be turned into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, yielded some surprising results.
Although the idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people is extremely disgusting, there are actually a lot more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his trip in Europe, Mr. Wright met with doctors and medical professionals regarding the increased health and health of stomach bacteria.
Fortunately, nothing he licked had an effect except the bad taste he left in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for traveling the world and testing the endurance of his stomach by eating strange and wonderful things.
This task, in a wide range from general handrails at train stations to toilet flush buttons, tested the immune system for sure.
In the film about this, he said: 'I haven't been a very attentive person to my health since I was a child, and I've put a lot of things in my mouth, from soil to worms and muddy water.'
During the course of the film, he firmly proved the reason for his reputation.
All he refused was a dirty public restroom in Russia.
The creep sample showed a luminometer count of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, in newly washed hands, this number should be below 60.
However, when the luminometer count went above 4,000 units in freshly washed hands, there was a Russian public toilet that he refused to lick.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
He said in the film, 'This is close to being one of the worst things I've ever smelled in a toilet.'
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was prepared with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, which help strengthen stomach bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio's Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juices and New Categories, said: "We really wanted to present something new to the consumers.
Something that is impressive to watch, and would also explain the benefits of probiotics.
We did a lot of crazy brainstorming where the idea of "let's call Ian" finally came up.
They claim that interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put products in a much larger context; the good and bad bacteria in our environment on a daily basis, the importance of stomach health, and its connection to the immune system.
Interest in stomach health is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we would be able to provide consumers with more information about this situation in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me tell you, if Ian had licked some of the things I wanted him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost respect for him."
Although licking things naturally was easy for Ian, some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we've recorded some of these nasty licking acts.'
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with stomach health, and 58 percent said they used products containing lactic acid bacteria at least intermittently.
Maganda family destroys Saltash, Cornwall social housing before eviction
A maganda family left 50,000 euros worth of damage in the social housing where they were evacuated for fear of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her wife Shaun Trebilcock were expelled from the residence in Saltash, Cornwall after many complaints.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, the housing association officials were surprised to see that the property was irreparable.
Large holes were present in the walls, floorboards were dismantled, trash was scattered on the floors, and graffiti was written on the walls.
The family is now suspended from housing and is thought to have taken advantage of private accommodation options
Donna McEvoy, the housing manager for Cornwall Housing, said she feared the situation would be unsavable.
He said: 'This is really a nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There is a lot to attend to because this property will now be known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and their name has a bad reputation.
The family had three sons living in the intermediate estate, and according to police, the family had adopted many frightening behaviors, including fighting with a baseball bat on the street, scaring nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing, and excessive yelling, arguing, and mold.
In June, antisocial behavior was decided for Skeldon (47), named in the lease.
Old trash was found in many rooms of the house, which was thought to be destroyed.
The floorboards of the property, which had been sold drugs in the past, had been dislodged.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and police were often called.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted him and his wife from the property this week after they had been extended for 11 weeks to move in voluntarily.
The evacuation was greeted with joy by relieved neighbors who said their lives had turned into nightmares.
One person said, 'No one cared.'
We've been living side by side with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You wouldn't believe how many times we've seen cops here.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We woke up because it was so quiet; we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, everything's gonna be great now.
Cornwall Housing's neighbouring sanctions officer, Adam Fitzpatrick, said the family did not cooperate with the local administration.
The family had lived in this house for 20 years, and the property was often called to police.
Garbage and old toys were dumped on the plant-covered side of the social housing.
He added: 'It is a real shame that he and his family did not take any responsibility for the evacuation; the evacuation has always been the last option Cornwall Housing has resorted to.
This was a very challenging case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions were frightening to the extent that neighbors should not bear witness to.
I greatly appreciate the efforts of my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, and the community members who bravely stood out to inform us.
I hope that this development will provide some relief for the neighbors and be understood as a message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said they had three sons who lived on property at different times, but they were in their 20s.
A dirty bed left on the floor in one of the house's bedrooms after the evacuation
Housing workers will need to clean up the piles of trash surrounding the house.
In 2014, police raided the property, finding over 70 grams of cannabis, scales, private items, and a cash sum of 1700 euros.
Skeldon was fined after he pleaded guilty to Class B drug possession with intent to sell it.
He claimed he would use the money to buy a tombstone for his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it became clear that Tanya and her wife were now living in a private residence in Plymouth.
Most of the house's rooms had graffiti on their walls.
Police say they will work towards evicting tenants who violate rent rules
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the evacuation was also a warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
He said, "This is also a message for those who think they can act as they please without facing any charges, and that their behavior will go to waste."
Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, who will continue to work with their partners to protect the community, will never tolerate crime and antisocial behavior.
Tourists in Portugal are horrified as low-flying military plane passes just over the beach
Tourists sunbathing in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
Portuguese air force flies its P-3C Orion extremely low
The air force said it was a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is when tourists start panicking as the low-flying jet passes over the full beach.
Dramatic images show military aircraft nearing the level of contact with those sunning on sand in Aveiro, north of Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up from their understandable concern over the noise created by jet engines before they could see what was coming towards them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationers who posted a video of the dramatic close flight on social media, said: 'He's been through it really low twice and at some point it seems like he's about to crash.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was driving and I swear I felt like the plane was going to fall on me.'
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane out of the darkness began flying at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify the fishing boats on the beach, and had to go so low that it was the only way to control them.
He said the jet flew lower than normal, as visibility was poor due to the smoke from the nearby extinguishing-hard fire, but the air force insisted that no one's safety had been compromised.
This summer, fire, which was difficult to extinguish, destroyed certain parts of the Portuguese mainland and caused the deaths of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today that the pilot must fly low due to conditions that make it difficult to see (severe fog and smoke from fires that are difficult to extinguish).
The plane was on a training flight and as part of the exercise the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats.
London schoolgirl joins ISIS, killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee testified that his family had received information about his death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that he is believed to have died in a Russian air raid on the Rakka region, where the group was strong in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and died while plotting to escape the war-torn country and return to Britain, according to her family.
"We hope that this situation emphasizes that it is really risky for others to go to war zones as a tombstone and testament, and that people will discourage them from making that choice."
In February 2015, two girls from Sultana and eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family were told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid said he would not give up Garland as a Supreme Court candidate if Clinton was elected.
In the Senate, Democratic Leader Harry Reid expressed confidence that Democrats would nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have been blocking Garland's approval process since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said the new president would elect the replacement of former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
In a video chat on Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would choose Garland and "had reasons for it".
Later, a spokesman for Reid said he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether he would nominate Garland, and speculated.
He praised Garland and stated that Clinton's team did not want to "disrupt the current situation" by making a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Columbia State.
Reid stated that the Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "assistants" and "neighbors".
He stated that Trump was not eligible for the post.
Treats said he favoured a nude calendar 'for women as well as for men'
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by the Pirelli of the 1970s for 2017.
Instead of famous and naked people, however, they are working to find a new generation of top models for the 2017 NU Inspirational Fairies calendar.
Steve Shaw, Treats' president, stated earlier this year that this magazine, which had a high rate of nudity, was different from the old Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
He obviously believes that's what the calendar is all about.
Shaw said in a press release about the calendar, "Like men, we need to go back to exhibiting classic nudity, which is not outdated, so that women can easily look at these images of the female body as inspiration."
Women will want to be part of this project, as it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can post photos online or participate in open talks in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl target: who are the people who actually buy records?
Middle-aged, lonely men love vinyl.
Let us say that this statement is based on actual data before going to the comment section to make spectacular insults under the noun.
According to YouGov, the return of records, which are a subject of much mention, is not a result of the millennial pursuit of innovation created by a physical object, but of middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who recently purchased vinyl albums are mostly between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely.
This is also not only due to the act of accumulating enthusiasts; it is of emotional importance; older vinyl buyers often like to keep their feelings to themselves (56% and 53%), and people who enjoy being alone (69% and 66%).
Are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog was a televised story, the camera would watch Soho walking down a crowded street in a modest grey suit, performing many gestures before stopping, and then putting my hands together and opening my hands, saying something as authoritative as this: "Then let's take a look."
Then, let's take a look.
As Soho's center gradually loses its magic and unusual air (the buildings where once independent vendors were now filled with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases), there are still a few specialist record stores.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next part; I'd try to learn about their age and emotional state through observation by standing near different men in some of these stores.
Stuart of Glasgow (55), who I followed from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) on his way to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, possibly a woman in her 20s), spends the afternoon in London for a meeting and browses the stores to fill in her spare hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
He says, "I think I am."
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, which are located above the picture (the picture sent me by e-mail, I did not follow him home) decorate the walls of the living room.
The reason he collects so many albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income; when he first comes out, he can buy records he can't afford and buy back what he sold in his young and penniless time.
"Most of the things I get are things I got in the late '60s and early '70s when I was 11 or 12; I'm too young to buy," he says.
He agrees with the idea that those who buy records are likely to be introverted people who like to be alone: "I don't smoke, I don't drink a lot of alcohol.
That's my bad habit.
Wez (25), who works at Sister Ray, also thinks that many of the customers he encounters fit into the YouGov profile.
However, he also realized that a new wave had formed that was influenced by exaggerated advertising in the media, that people who heard this fashion coming back needed to buy back old records.
In my interviews, I found that normally in 1998 or 1999, people were handing out their collections.
Customers who used to sell their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to get the records back."
This may explain the increase in people of a certain age who are reviving vinyl.
What about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It takes a few seconds to realize that record stores in a store like Phonica offer a comforting community of similar personalities.
According to Wez, some older customers were offended by the especially contactless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may want to seek refuge in the stability of familiar record covers that evoke memories of overwhelmed and calm youth from the digital world.
Wez says, "Sometimes this may be because of filling a gap or seeing material items as a form of comfort."
Since I'm a collector myself, I have this, and I think most people have it.
This is an easy way to fill your head.
"We're like social workers," says a co-worker, who sprang out of a stack of records.
A poll in April revealed that 50% of vinyl album buyers last month had not yet listened to the album.
The survey also found that 41% had a pickup that they never used, and 7% bought vinyl when they didn't have a record player.
At this stage of the news, I would probably make an extremely anxious appearance while reviewing a series of bossa nova compositions.
The "reward" aspect of this return is also noticed by Jonny (42), who works in the Sounds of Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
"Somebody came to me recently and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record to put it on our shelf.'"
While this does not represent a large percentage, it certainly reflects the current situation.
More products, less music.
There are people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are not the elderly, but the young, who are in their late teens, who are new to the subject.
By the time I get to Fopp, who has now reserved almost an entire solid for vinyl, I see that the audience is quite variable.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, young boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less serene than the stores mentioned above (the last piece of Wild Beast), and sex-content pop is spreading from the speakers instead of calming jazz, it is good to see diversity among customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to resolve the psychological traumas that disturb them by standing next to someone for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) has been wandering around Fopp for a few minutes and browsing the records at the discount.
Instead of spending, he just went out to look at the windows.
He says he doesn't have the option of collecting records because he doesn't earn much.
It's very costly.
It's easier to listen to music from the computer or in other ways, but the beauty of vinyl..." she sighs away like a loving person.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really nothing like it.
My last stop is a store that is said to inspire a new generation of vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Outfitters.
While pretending to study jeans, I observe a group of young girls gathered around Polaroid cameras for a while before a father and daughter argued about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairwell filled with records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac; essential records for an average collection; a mix of modern and classic.
No one is looking; perhaps these are just for decoration, some too high to be touched.
This is a purely "artificial vinyl".
However, curiosity about these items could mean that the industry will make more money and send fewer customers deep into Soho; there are not many issues to complain about.
It is not surprising that a demographic group that has more money and time than most spends more on luxury items such as vinyl.
My findings, however, show that YouGov's results are at least true in Soho record stores; they do not account for female collectors and vinyl enthusiasts who are outnumbered, in reality, in record stores or online forums.
These people are probably working pretty hard at school or offices.
These people certainly don't spend Thursday evenings wandering around record stores on Berwick Street, examining records and avoiding the gaze of a 30-year-old fake television host looking over the shoulders of middle-aged men who didn't know anything.
Greenland shark, world's longest-lived vertebrate animal - video news
Scientists have explained that the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan among vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, stated that the record belongs to a five-metre-long female, thought to be between the ages of 272 and 512.
French court rejects offer to demolish stores in Jungle refugee camp
A court in France rejected the offer made by Calais officials to demolish dozens of crack shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During this week's court hearing, Calais officials argued that a total of 72 makeshift stores should be demolished, where the state sells many products from cigarettes to energy drinks, haircuts, or sells from basic dishes for 50 cents (40p) for tea or a few euros.
The Governorship of Calais argued that these places should be demolished, as they create a parallel economy that is not taxed, and are at risk of fire and hygiene.
Benevolent groups have explained to the court that stores and restaurants are vital, and the free food offered by state-sponsored organizations and other groups is not enough for the growing population in the camp.
They argued that crack shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
A court in Lille stated that there was no legal basis for the deportation of the people who ran the 72-mint store, but that the concerns of the Governor of Calais were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Mullah stated that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants play a much greater role than simply feeding people who live in "extremely dangerous conditions".
These areas provide comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers, he said.
Book Cafe for non-profit Jungle Children, one of the places in danger of destruction, offers 200 meals a day, teaches English and French, and here, hundreds of underage refugees in the camp are given advice on asylum.
Over 170,000 people signed petitions to protect this cafe for children.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was stated that this closure would "be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the population in the Jungle camp rose to over 9,000 (the highest to date) after increasing arrivals during the summer period.
Following gold in the Fiji master class, Britain was satisfied with a silver medal in the rugby sevens championship.
Great Britain's impressive progress at the Rugby 7s Championship ended after a 43-7 defeat at Rio Deodoro Stadium in the final on Thursday with Fiji.
Fiji taught mastery in grip, rust, sidestep, support, running lines, and muscle strength to receive the gold medal, the first Olympic medal of any color.
Following the defeat, Britain received the third silver medal of the day as a not-so-bad consolation prize, and can now be proud of their efforts at the Olympic 7th opening tournament, where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
At the beginning of the day, the South African Team may have found them in the final after they beat them 7-5 in the semi-finals.
But still, a Fiji in such form could beat a team of 15.
While not very believable, perhaps Great Britain can find comfort in thinking that at least one Brit will wear a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, an Englishman from Wimbledon.
This has been a rather difficult journey for Great Britain.
Eight roads ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens Championship.
This time, they only lost one.
Although this defeat is painful, the progress shown is truly astonishing.
Fiji got off to a fascinating start, as players bounced over Great Britain's attempts to take the ball.
This was like running between a series of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and World Series champions took the 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisao moved out of the corner.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai faced another number with a fallout from the right wing.
The match was 12-0 and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great intervention prevented the mountain-like Leone Nakarawa from throwing out the third, but that was only to delay Fiji's number.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner and Great Britain fell 17-0.
With only a minute to go before the first half ended, Nakarawa came up from the beginning to score another point.
Vatemo Ravuvou then flew through some tough Great Britain interventions to the line for the number.
With this number, the score reached 29-0 between the half.
While Fiji was a team set up to play in the 7th championship, Great Britain seemed to be still trying to learn the basics of the job.
This is more or less the case.
Great Britain made major changes between the half and closed the Fiji dam; for exactly four minutes, which was a good improvement over the first half until Josua Tuisova came on stage with the perfect Fiji play.
Dan Norton made a try for Great Britain, and although he tried to score from the left corner to make the score 36-7, the game fans were in the hands of the singing, waving flags and dancing South Sea Islanders.
It was really hard not to admire Fiji's cheerful approach from start to finish.
Maa Viliame also adored the final additions to the game of Fiji, which did not need to be decorated in the last minutes.
When the whistle sounded, the Fijians began to celebrate, and Great Britain took the path of the dressing room, defiantly.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, while Great Britain faced South Africa in a tough semi-final match; Britain took the lead with a single point.
Kyle Brown led the South African team in the first half, but Dan Norton took the lead in the second half with dizzying foot movements.
With the wonderful intervention of Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who was in the top 15 in England, the victory and the silver medal were guaranteed.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning triumphed in the row, inspired by their coach's fight against cancer.
There will be no more emotional gold medal in these games, and that means something important.
After 220 painful breaths from the first move to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they won the gold at Estacio da Lagoa could mean a lot more.
Although there were two people who rowed, there were three voices on the boat; the women's double race echoed the sound of their coach Robin Williams on the boat as they progressed to the second consecutive gold Olympic medal as the first women to reach such a level in England this year.
Their dominance was quite clear; this was the 39th race in their unprecedented, unbeaten series.
Although we see two great athletes floating on the surface in swan grace, this image does not accurately reflect the quality of victory.
Behind every rowing gold medal is a battalion of willing hands that provide the incremental gains that make this difference, and no hand was as effective as their coach, who did not know if he would live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
As he said, they touched and left.
I had the type of bladder cancer that could be operated on, and they did.
If they don't, it goes everywhere.
That would be a pretty bad situation.
This slightly changes the way you look at life.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
He was very lucky to be able to start treatment outside of the season, at the beginning of 2014, in such cases it is not known if there is a correct expression, but this way the distraction will be minimized.
I had to get paid, so I had to recover quickly.
It was an incentive for me.
I was in the hospital, and although they said it was enough to take a few steps, I was walking about 6, 9, 15 meters in the garden.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey on its own, but it makes it a little bigger.
After the victory, their minds were at Williams, who had had a nervous morning, who spoke a little more than usual to overcome his own concerns.
"I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it really means a lot," said Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Association and had previously been to Afghanistan.
This once again highlights what this means to me and how hard Helen, me and Robin work.
I had a great three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be either, so I'd like to give him my biggest thanks for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find a better person or a better coach to work with.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the race in five years.
The two have achieved a challenging rhythm that their opponents can't reach.
Stanning and Glover's power had not yet been exhausted, even in the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Danish teams were closing in.
We had lost ourselves to that moment.
Helen was calling 'watch the process, watch the process'.
It's really important not to get caught up in it.
We had a good start, and we weren't trying to do anything amazing.
We weren't expecting the fireworks to explode today, we just wanted to win the race where we rowed well, which we did.
The two will take a year off before deciding what to do in the future.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month; his and television adventurer Steve Backshall's.
For now, he just wants to enjoy this moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
This would create a lot of pressure.
It took me six months to realize I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was so new and I was so stressed.
Here, it took about four minutes.
It's a much better feeling."

Bulgaria Announces Inflation Values for First Time in 8 Months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria in June was at 1%.
This is the highest value seen in years (since June 2012), but the first seen above zero since October, after a positive 0.2% value last year.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 – July 2016) was 0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 – July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0 percent compared to June 2016, meaning monthly inflation was at 1.0 percent.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate (July 2016 to December 2015 comparison) was -0.2%, and the monthly inflation gap from July 2016 to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, price growth was observed in the following consumer product groups: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in groups of clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, home equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), and health (0.1%).
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; prices remained the same in communication and training groups.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Criticised as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says it is inspired by anime for this filter, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Snapchat allows around 150 million users every day to play with their absurd level of identity by changing reality with the lens tool.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character who has been ejected from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Lenses are reckless, feature-shifting tools that create over 30 million improved selfies each day.
The missteps are rapidly being dug into the public's memory.
Snapchat lenses have faced accusations in the past that the app supports black classification or offers bleached skin tones as an ideal for beauty.
Therefore, due to the lens they presented this week, which made users slant-eyed, broken-toothed, and bloated cheeks, some critics criticized the company for being a "Asian mask" that caricatures Asians.
And they wondered if these recurring conflicts pointed to a larger problem with the company's diversity.
News and anger spread with the news of The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday, and the day after, Snapchat announced it had removed the feature.
The company made a statement: The lens was not prepared for the caricature of Asians, but in homage to anime characters.
For observers with experience of racism, however, this lens reminded them of the heartbreaking stereotypes.
Others generally rejected the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student and tweeting about photographs, said in an email that the lens was "painful and uncomfortable in the lightest terms".
"It's hard to argue when it comes to comparing the effects of the filter side-by-side with the bad Asian cartoon.
This suggests that the filter is not only an Asian mask, but also an Asian mask on a derogatory level.
Snapchat is not the only company that has gone beyond cultural trigger mechanisms.
American culture appears to be in an endless conflict over diversity and inclusiveness in many areas, from the meeting rooms of institutions to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And what Snapchat is appealing to is that they may also be expecting a higher sensitivity, with a wide range of young people more likely to be racially diverse than any other opponent.
In an interview Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates a humiliating image for a user, it is "much harder not to notice such movements as they used to be."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and called for everyone to do so.
In his article for Medium and in an interview with the phone, he said he believed that racial conflicts reflected shortcomings in diversity in recruitment practices on Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's leading team of mostly white men, ending her article with a tag: #SnapchatiSilin.
Ms Zhu, a Chinese-American, said, "Either because different races among their staff are not sufficiently diverse, they can make such decisions, or even though there are people who work there and belong to different races, they don't feel safe or comfortable enough to talk about themselves."
Other observers share his views on this complaint, which Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not share figures on the diversity among its staff, highlighting the private company situation.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to share its staff's racial origins, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently incorporated a hiring officer in an effort to focus on populations that were not adequately represented and to increase inclusion internally.
Ms. Zhu stated, in her own way, that she would keep her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us who can say that's not true."
Congress Panel Says Military Officials Evacuated ISIS Intelligence
In a report released on Thursday, a congressional panel reported that the United States Central Command Officials were falsifying intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than in the field.
An interim report by a branch of the Palace's Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Defense Grant Subcommittee formed by Republican board presidents found that there was "common dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said their superiors had altered the assessments of the Islamic State of America's forces.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters located in Tampa, Fla., overseeing American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A newsletter on the report stated: "The intelligence results approved by senior Centcom leaders typically paint a more positive picture of the U.S. anti-terrorism efforts than the facts in the field show, and consistently provide much more positive results than the analysis of other elements of the intelligence community."
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said, "What happens at Centcom is unacceptable; our fighter troops are suffering as bad analyses are being presented to senior decision-makers."
Leadership failures at Centcom have reached the top levels of the organization.
The 10-page report also details the permanent problems in 2014 and 2015, which were included in the Central Command's statement and analysis of America's efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be changed, it is explained that analysts feel pressure from Centcom leaders to offer a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional statements were significantly more positive than actual events," the report says.
For example, a Centcom official stated that a major military attack for the revocation of Mosul publicly could be carried out as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Kansas's Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement, "After months of research, this matter has been fairly clearly understood."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the most senior intelligence leaders of the Central Command of the United States manipulated the commander's intelligence results to make the threat posed by ISIS seem trivial in Iraq.
Republicans formed a working arm after they learned that analysts expressed concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State had been manipulated.
As the reviews continue, the report, published on Thursday, will follow much more comprehensive findings.
Another Centcom intelligence review is also available, which is being conducted by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee also published their own findings on Thursday, which participated in some of the conclusions reached by the Republican working arm.
Representative Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the committee, said in a statement that "between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an extremely narrow-minded process in intelligence assessments of ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces."
According to Mr. Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results", leading to demoralization among analysts, and "not enough room for opposing views."
However, Mr. Schiff and the Democrats have not found any evidence that the White House has pressured Centcom analysts to fabricate "a predetermined or political narrative" of their results.
Preliminary results of the congressional review were announced by the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector general review was available after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Senior Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, as a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report in the process of the general inspector's examination.
However, he said that "experts may disagree on the interpretation of complex data in some cases, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense support healthy dialogue regarding these important national security issues."
The research will resonate beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria is ongoing (this is an argument raised by more and more Defence officials).
However, last year's accusations raised the question of how much President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations at Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Critics of the reflection of Islamic State intelligence began when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article in which the administration of President George W. Bush argued for the possession of a small force in Iraq despite the objections of many analysts, and did not think enough about the aftermath of the 2003 invasion, and it has been debated for more than a decade.
Mr. Hooker also played an important role in the rebellion against Islamic State intelligence.
Officials said Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements in the opposite direction last year, air strikes against refineries held by the Islamic State did not significantly affect the terrorist group's financial resources, as they had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
However, as The Times noted in September, this finding did not go outside the Central Command.
Centcom's then-commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, last year's statement in the Senate was criticized by many legislators for being viewed as an extremely positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Women's Grass Hockey Team Prepares to Face Britain Wins 4th Backward Victory
Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the United States women's field hockey team in Thursday's match against India, a day after she scored three goals in a 6-1 win against Japan.
Although five goals in two games seem to require a catchy mastery, Bam 27, said he was unsure if he had done the same before.
He said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
What he knows is that the Americans are 4-0 ahead in the Olympic tournament and share the first place in the group with Britain, who continues to be undefeated after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face off on Saturday for the final game of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals, and the match will determine who will finish first and who will finish second in the six-team group's matches.
The team, which finished first in the group matches, will not face another group's leader, the strong Dutch team, for a slightly longer period of time when the quarterfinals begin.
However, following Saturday's match, the Americans made a surprising progress here after the London Olympics, where they came last out of 12 teams.
Bam was on this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa.; he was 3 years old when he first picked up the field hockey bat (two of his older sisters were interested in this sport at Drexel), and he joined the national team at the age of 16 to become the team's youngest player.
He missed the 2008 Olympics because he couldn't make the final squad.
Then came 2012 when most things didn't work out for him and his teammates.
The following year, a British coach, Craig Parnham, was appointed and things began to change.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam says.
We don't work like we do in London anymore.
We've been completely transformed.
On Thursday night, Bam received the first issue of the first half with a close reverse kick.
India had not yet won a win in the tournament, but the team was able to maintain the score at 1-0 until the third quarter, when Bam stepped in.
He took a long run with the ball from the left of the field and then curled up and threw the ball into the fort and put the Americans up to 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first match in which United States goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who allowed one goal in the first three victories, did not score in the tournament.
He got lucky.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but how good this place is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The Restlessness of Trampoline in the Middle of Olympic Ambition
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics continue.
The events in Rio de Janeiro represent an ambitious competition and work, and as if it would never end or be avoided.
The Olympic torch itself is like a flaming baton transmitted from the swimmer to the gymnast from there to the triathlonist.
Simone Biles can't watch television, read newspapers, or listen to what your neighbor says in a cafe without hearing anything about the contention between Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, who participated in the Olympics for the first time, may be one of the names shown during prime time hours, among the sponsorships and TV commercials that advise you to feel good about yourself, a dimpled heart rate ball like a swimmer, gymnast or fencer.
Mr. Dooley of Lake Forest, California, however, is fighting for the gold medal in the trampoline at the Olympics (28).
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equally.
Away from the centre, partly in the shade, there are spores that are not universally recognized: air rifle shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.
Frogging will always be with us, wishing it were for a long time.
However, I would like to point out my personal favorite, the hidden magic of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been known as an Olympic event since it was introduced in the Sydney games in 2000, few people I have asked in the 16 years between had realized it was an Olympic sport.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to compete, it never won a medal in the trampoline, and had no contestants who reached the finals until 2012.
In men, the awards were tended to be shared by Chinese and Russians, and in women by Chinese and Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan will try to protect the gold medals they received in London this year.
The trampoline, however, is noted as an underprivileged event, partly because it is thought to be worthy of clown school instead of Olympics in unconscious ears.
I have to admit I'm not an expert here, I'm just interested in the subject.
It has a funny potential (like the cartoon-like flicker created by the never-ending leap), but it also reflects the elegance of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it basically combines.
The word "trambolin" comes from the Spanish word el trampolin, which means "tramplen".
Champion candidates leap almost 30 feet above the air in a large trampoline, and are asked to perform a series of moves (burk, pike and salto) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are assessed based on execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes will compete in Rio, including 16 men and 16 women from 17 countries.
The most frequent advance at the Olympics is the direct advance.
Those who hope to receive medals should go further, faster, and higher in their quest for gold, in some cases to the finish point, and in some cases back and forth, and up and down.
Not only are they after the finish line or the starting wall, but there is another challenging line on television; the world or the Olympic record.
This tenacious effort is noble, enamoured, and even at extreme levels; enough to tear even an audience into tears.
This, however, is just one of the features I find slightly exhausting when watching the Games.
Trampoline allows you to take a break from all this.
The trampolines move upwards.
Their goal is not to move forward.
It jumps up, looks weightless like an astronaut, goes up, goes down, and goes up effortlessly again.
Of course it can't be said that there is no competition or difficulty, but during the course of the routine there is no feverish study to reach the conclusion, no disappearance at a distance, only the imagined, elegant suspension of time and gravity.
The more serene an Olympic race can be.
The women's rankings and subsequent finals will be held Friday afternoon at 13.00 Eastern time; the men again on Saturday at 13.
NBC will broadcast the finals on both days starting at 2:00 p.m. as a block in the afternoon.
In the midst of the Olympic frenzy, they promise a quiet and wonderful moment that can be ignored in the general riot.
And if consciousness is to increase by offering male athletes just to browse and objectify, as the United States male gymnasts have recently suggested, we can say that Mr. Dooley is waiting for new fans.
"A Generation in Protest" in Ethiopia, a long-time U.S. ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia faced fierce resistance from the government.
Witnesses say a large number of protesters received fatal gunshots in a shootout with police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable nations and a solid ally for the West with its fast-growing economy.
However, anti-government protests in recent months have spread to more and more regions, shaking the country.
Just last week, thousands took to the streets to demand fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response to this was rather brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed a large number of unarmed demonstrators.
Protest footage, thought to be from late last year or early this year, shows security officials lashing out young people who had to lay their hands on a wall.
The top United Nations human rights official is now requesting a thorough review.
Rashid Abdi, project director for the Somali Peninsula of the International Crisis Group, a research group, said, "It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to move forward."
Ethiopia is one of Africa's highest-populated nations after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly Somalia, and there are very few countries in Africa that have received such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing impressively.
Its infrastructure has been effectively improved; a new commuter train is even available in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although the best example of democracy was not displayed in Ethiopia (human rights groups consistently refer to the repressive attitude of the government), domestic opposition was highly limited, with opponents effectively silenced.
Most were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or exiled to the farthest corners of the desert.
However, this may be about to change.
Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from central Ethiopia, said, "If you drown people and offer them no choice but to protest, these events will occur."
Youth is in full protest.
A generation in protest.
There are many complaints from land use to the pressures exerted by the ruling coalition on power.
After last year's highly criticized election, the ruling party and its allies have also taken the last seat filled by opponents and are now able to control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions at the border with Eritrea, the pointed and controversial line that led to the war in June, in which hundreds of people died.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have disappeared in recent years, will be re-armed by exploiting this turbulence.
There are several factors that explain why the bitter feelings that have been boiling beneath the surface for years now are exploding.
The first one seems innocent: smartphones.
As cheap smartphones became common and internet services were provided, only a few years ago, large numbers of Ethiopians began communicating using social media.
Even when the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during times of protest, most people were able to communicate through internet proxy servers that hid their location.
Several young Ethiopians said they were gathering in this way for protests.
Secondly, solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's two major ethnic groups, also increased.
The Oromos and Amharas are not normally allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian mountainous areas have stood out in politics and business, exploiting Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live on flat land.
However, this situation is also changing.
Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader, said, "We are moving towards getting together and cooperating under an umbrella."
The largest protests were seen in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Most Amhara and Oromo think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and dominate the military, intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third reason behind the unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Mr. Meles served as prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012 from an undisclosed illness.
It was thought to be a tactical genius, seeing what not everyone could see.
Analysts say he is particularly adept at detecting the first signs of unrest and at easing and disabling opponents.
"The current regime does not have this basic knowledge," said conflict analyst Mr. Abdi.
Hailemariam Desalegn, the new prime minister of Ethiopia, was elected in relative uncertainty to replace Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is southern.
Analysts say he failed to gain the confidence of security services controlled by Tigrayans.
As a result, more blood was shed with more fear.
Ethiopia's last experience with such a mix-up was in 2005 when thousands of people protested after the thefts by analysts after a sloppy election by the government.
In the measures that followed, though less than last month, many protesters were killed, and this period of confusion also passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and significant progress on fighting poverty.
However, it is clear that this did not stop the increase in grudge against the Ethiopian government.
And it's becoming dangerous and ethnic.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and Tigrayan hatred has also increased on social media.
Analysts say the protests left other allies in the United States and the West in a strange situation.
The U.S. government was using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighbouring Somalia; however, it was recently said that this base had been shut down.
Although the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want this ally in an already fragile region to be torn apart.
Mr. Abdi said, "It's like walking on a very thin rope."
Donald Trump Explains Obama's Claim in the Way He Formed ISIS as "Singularism"
Donald J. Trump tried to eliminate the recent conflict around his campaign Friday, insisting several times last week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not serious when claiming to be the "founders" of the Islamic State terror group.
This statement raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate openly with the American public.
At the same time, he put a strange position in the process in which they tried to explain the statement that this was not what he meant by his deputies doing their best to defend him in the process that created this turmoil.
Mr. Trump insisted that after making this suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night, he really implied that the president and Mrs. Clinton had founded ISIS in the interviews, further strengthening his thesis on Thursday.
However, in a post on Twitter early on Friday morning, Mr Trump said he had only made a cynical statement.
The post showed that Mr. Trump had completely backed down from the day before, when he stated in a series of interviews that he was serious about this accusation.
When conservative radio programmer Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften this comment, reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate said he did not believe it.
Mr. Trump, as he tried to change the focus of his campaign following the fall in the polls, the final confusion ensued.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave conflicting talks about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to get back on the subject.
He also spoke on Twitter, saying that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and find her speech boring.
Mr. Trump had used the sarcasm defense before.
Towards the end of July, after making an appearance suggesting that the Russians attack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails pirated, she explained these comments by saying, "Of course I said it in a sarcastic way."
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the boundaries of political speech and step back where necessary.
Ruth Sherman, a communications expert following the language used by both candidates, said, "It's a pattern that tests how certain messages are reacted by those who support it, allowing it to somehow "explain", depending on the response.
But at the same time, he makes these statements on purpose and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered when viewed through different lenses.
After a recent decline in polls, Mr. Trump took a much more aggressive stance, rather than softening the mood for the general election audience.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll published on Friday showed that Mr. Trump was well behind Mrs. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia, and Colorado, and that there was a tight race in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump generally avoids apologizing for the provocative things he says, he accuses his critics of deflecting his words or of not understanding his humor.
However, Mr. Trump's jokes, which were subject to much more scrutiny during the last months of his presidential campaign, leave his loyal supporters in a difficult position, who, however provocative his comments may be, have to support him in public.
Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, as one of Mr. Trump's most prominent supporters, did his best to defend the island in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
When asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump's thesis that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton have established the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, "I think he is making a legitimate, political criticism."
From a point of view, before Obama, ISIS was an unknown, small organization, the ones who found them adorable were all wrong, and that was because the soldiers withdrew from Iraq.
Most prominent Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Mrs. Clinton is the foreign ministry, has failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East and has caused ISIS to grow.
Prior to Friday's rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to accuse the news media on Twitter of distorting every word and acting biasedly towards him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television experts who were trying to resolve him, saying, "They can't do this!"
Some Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's excuse, saying it was evidence that he was not eligible for the presidency.
Cafe Greenpoint Once Unable to Handle Prices With Us Again
Verb Cafe, a former cash-only place in Williamsburg, did not offer a Wi-Fi connection, but offered great coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, he couldn't handle the prices at his store on Bedford Avenue.
The store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells Soap Cherie cup cake-shaped soaps.
Residents were close, expressing that this was the final loss of the decent city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote to Twitter, "New York is change, I know that, but I still can't believe that the CBGB is gone and the Chelsea Hotel has been vacated and that Verb is now a soap store."
But New York is a city of reinvention as much as change.
Last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location, a renovated Verb Cafe opened in the north.
The new Verb Cafe has a Wi-Fi connection and accepts credit cards, but retains some of its former employees and similar simple air.
Coffee's still good.
The head of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the former cafe, who also owns and manages the new location.
He joined Verb in 2001 and remained until the end.
He said he would be thrilled to do so when a customer offered him financing for this new place.
Mr. Rodriguez (36) left most things the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
In fact, the lights of the old Verb were reused here.
Mr. Rodriguez, however, said he wanted to offer some different experiences.
He added new materials.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are available on the menu, and ingredients such as capers and sauteed onions are also offered.
They have brown-rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer but offers fresh juices.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed that former regulars were beginning to arrive decisively.
He said, "Many of our former customers were also unable to cope with the prices in Williamsburg."
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and frequented Verb.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he didn't stop moving on that path.
Verb said he took a break from drinking coffee for a while after it closed.
"I realized that what I loved was coffee and culture in Verb," he said.
He now started drinking coffee again, but the other day he chose a new add-on, dew mix instead of his usual iced coffee.
Another regular, Tom Rosenthal, went to Verb on a regular basis from 2003.
He went there before work and always ordered the same thing.
"Every day, at quarter past seven, I would go in without fail and they would make my daily order of buttered bagels," he said.
Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to make changes and added new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Mr. Rosenthal is still taking his usual order, but sometimes he makes some changes by adding bacon, eggs and cheese to his daily bagel order.
Mr. Rodriguez said he was not upset with the soap store, which replaced the old place.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the cafe's cold brewed coffee.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer."
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also adopted this cafe.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said that he would soon find a space to showcase this menu so that his new neighbors would feel good about themselves as well.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice shop wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee.
There is a possibility that the cafe will be expanded by spreading to the building next door.
For most customers, it is enough to have a new Verb available where they can find their old favourites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and was very upset after the place was closed.
When the new venue opened, Mr. Whitt said that it made him feel at home to be able to come in and get coffee.
He said, "I had to smell it."
The Depressive Food of Crisis Time in the book "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, just after his seat as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, who was fond of his throat, loved fancy Fifth Avenue foods like foie liver paste and Maryland turtle soup.
The menu on that day was much more modest: boiled eggs with tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and pudding with prunes as dessert.
Jane Ziegelman said, "This was an act to build solidarity with those who were in distress about food."
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple who live in Brooklyn Heights, a food historian.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Mrs. Ziegelman, in her book "97 Orchard", described the lives of slums in the Lower East Region through food.
The new book they work with, "A Square Meal", which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, tells the history of American food during the Great Depression.
They also met with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet in the Flatiron area, which had been in existence since 1929, the year the crisis began, by demonstrating solidarity with food.
Mrs. Ziegelman (54) ordered a sandwich with cream cheese and olives, while Mr. Coe (57) chose to sit turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter's order of meatloaf appropriate for discussion of crisis-era food.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "Societies were very popular."
He had peanut nuts, liver nuts, dry beans nuts.
These were made from something cheap that spreads the material with a material.
Imagine if you ate enough peanuts for dinner.
Mr. Coe, he frowned.
He said, "He must have sat in a man's stomach like a bullet."
In the years before the crisis, especially in rural areas, the tables in America were like buffets.
Women were cooking for men working on the farm, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Americans were sending food to Europeans who starved in World War I. "A Square Meal" explains the history of the way the nation dealt with its sudden failure to become a center of abundance.
Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it, saying, "This was a time when food became a central, worrying issue for Americans."
The new budget regime was equally worrisome: mysterious foods such as nuts and casseroles became staple consumer products, as Mrs. Ziegelman notes, "the casseroles were a great way to evaluate the remaining dishes" so that cooks could hide the appetite-receptive ingredients below with a creamy sauce coating.
Fresh fruits were replaced by dried fruits, which were cheaper.
Over the years, meat at the center of American food has become a frugally divided luxury.
Interesting mixtures were tried for calorie and nutritional value, and the sense of satisfaction presided over taste or general understanding of cuisine.
While Ms. Ziegelman was researching for her book, which included recipes, she prepared onion dinner in the peanut butter-filled oven of that period.
"This was not a well-liked addition to the dinner table," Mr Coe said.
Mrs. Ziegelman supported this: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing in common with onions in the oven.
This was a prominent feature in most home economics recipes.
Home economics experts, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, conducted the country's eating habits between 1923 and 1943 as never before.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be "savvy" and popularized the struggle to turn slurps like carrot cream spaghetti into delicious food.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historic delicious delicacies.
The government's responses to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's attitude to let me eat cake, are highly appetizing.
On the one hand, he was praising the simple Iowa farmer's food in his childhood, while on the other hand, he was eating food like the millionaire intellectual he had become.
"He liked to eat European culinary delicacies like fish with cucumber sauce," said Mr. Coe.
He was eating his meals in a dining room almost entirely covered in gold, wearing jackets suitable for dinner.
It was extremely far from the truth.
If his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
According to the book's account, with Mrs. Roosevelt hiring an aide who cared nothing about flavor, the White House began to offer not only the "worst food ever prepared, but also the bleakest prepared dishes".
After the country was back on its feet, many of its cooking methods during the crisis were put aside.
According to Ms. Ziegelman, understanding of calories and nutrition and the way science is applied to cooking continues.
The couple stated that while writing the book, Mrs. Ziegelman learned a lot from her mother's eating habits - for example, she could never throw the food away.
Mr. Coe said, "The waste of food really scared him."
Ms. Ziegelman spoke of her old memories: "It really did make people sick."
There was a case of creme doughnuts.
After the plates were collected at Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe took out a dessert they had prepared at home: a pruned dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten at lunch.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "It's called scrambled prunes," and added that the most frequently referenced trick was to give these modest recipes a cool name.
There was no whipped cream; just prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone hesitantly dipped the spoon of brown sticky slur.
Surprisingly, it wasn't so bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third spoon.
He said to his wife, like someone who might be saving money, "A bit of chopped walnuts would be nice."
Merck to receive Gilead lawyer fees in battle for Hepatitis C patent
According to the U.S. district judge's decision, Gilead Sciences Inc. has been entitled to attorney fees for the hepatitis C patent case conducted with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
After the U.S. judge found that Merck had committed a series of misbehaviors, including perjury and other unethical practices, Gilead had been denied $200 million in damages for violations of two Merck patents relating to Gilead's highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, in June.
At Thursday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman testified that Gilead was entitled to compensation for fees incurred during the case defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, the market's judge, with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed forces have expressed complete control of Membic from the Islamic State.
On Friday, a group spokesman, US-backed forces, said the last Islamic State fighters inside the city had also taken full control of the northern city of Membic, near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) are also in the process of clearing the city, following the departure of a group of militants who remain hidden in the city.
Sharfan Dervis, of the Membic Military Council in alliance with the SDF, informed the Routers that they had released over 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants.
He told Routers, "The city is now completely under our control, but we are conducting cleanup work."
The Clinton family earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax of 34.2%.
Hillary Clinton announced on Friday a 2015 tax statement showing that Democrats' presidential candidate and wife earned $10.75 million last year and paid a federal tax of 34.2% in effect.
In 2015, the Clinton family contributed $1 million to charities, most of them to the Clinton Foundation, former president Bill Clinton made about $5.3 million in speech fees, and the former foreign minister declared $3 million in revenue for his book, which came out of Simon & Schuster's publishing house in relation to his time in the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, the U.S. Senator, Tim Kaine of Virginia, issued a 10-year tax statement with his wife, Anne Holton.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax of 20.3%.
Clinton campaign official Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement, "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency."
In contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses for his promises to disclose his tax statements first and backs down.
Although it does not require laws, it is a tradition for U.S. presidential candidates to publicly submit their tax statements.
Trump and his lawyers, a New York businessman, testified that the reason for the rejection of the release of the statements was an audit conducted by the Revenues Administration.
In connection with the Democratic candidate's statements, Clinton campaign official Ian Sams tweeted "You're next".
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were complete.
Criticizing Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans in 2012, the group expressed that this refusal posed questions about his own self-worth, contributions to charities, business deals, and many other connections, including those with Russia.
Clinton went over it on Friday by posting an online video showing senior Republicans pressuring Trump to disclose his taxes.
On Thursday, in an economic speech in Michigan, he voiced this problem.
He told the crowd, "For decades, he refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done, to issue tax statements."
Politico reported that Trump paid almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, the New York Times division of business columnist shared statements by a number of tax lawyers and accountants that the situation may still be going on like this.
Federal tax rates have become a major issue in the presidential election.
Clinton offered a rule bid named after billionaire investor Warren Buffet, which would allow those who have earned over $1 million a year to pay taxes at least 30 percent.
President Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Berkshire Hathaway group operating there, Buffett challenged him to come to Trump and submit his tax declaration.
Buffett stated that he himself was going through IRS supervision, and that Trump "feared" voters, not the tax collection agency.
Clinton issued tax statements in his campaign until 2007.
The Clinton family, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate reaches about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton family statement for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only about $100 of their income comes from fees.
Their main investment is a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clinton family has declared dividends and interest revenues to be $109,000.

Powdered red pepper condoms, chestnut flares support elephant protection in Tanzania
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from entering human settlements; they throw condoms full of powdered red peppers at them.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation and the U.S.-based Union for Conservation of Nature, which came up with the idea a few years ago, stepped in to introduce it; it began training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use the non-violent, four-step method of protecting their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, most people used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
Damian Bell, executive director of Honeyguide, said in a statement, "We have seen a change in attitude in these communities since we developed the set of vehicles; they are now more confident that they can keep elephants off their land without harming elephants."
The first two steps involve holding a passing elephant lantern and honking a horn.
When this is not possible, what is called the "red pepper cloud" is discarded.
The powdered red pepper mixed with soil is put into the condome with a chestnut cartridge, closing the tip so that only the detonator is exposed.
When burned, the condom opens with a banging sound and scatters powdered red peppers into the air.
One breath is enough to send the elephants in the opposite direction.
The last resort is to use a catapult that fires fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker slams hotel in Berlin, removing Israel's phone code over Arab "want" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin caused a sensation in the media after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone code and that the employee had put forward the "demands" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, one of the authors of the "Shoah" documentary on genocide, expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German broadcaster FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel during his recent stay.
However, the country was not among the states that could be searched directly from the room.
In 2016, how can Israel be eliminated and destroyed in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
The filmmaker reported the situation to the hotel's reception for a statement.
Lanzmann wrote that his response "shocked him".
The hotel's secretary stated that this measure was taken by "a deliberate decision of the Kempinski-Hotels administration".
The underlying reason for this move caused the filmmaker to become much more angry.
According to Lanzmann, the employee said, "Most of our guests wanted the code of Arab and Israeli to be deleted."
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the situation as "a great shame".
We were appalled and surprised by this.
It's a real shame.
It's a much bigger disgrace that this has happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain.
That doesn't need to be explained.
We expect the hotel to draw the necessary conclusions from this," the official said.
The incident sparked a major reaction online; people described it as a scandal.
Some have accused the Kempinski Hotel of "beloving down" to the so-called demands of Arab customers.
Another post noted that the hotel was located on Kurfurstendamm street near a synagogue, stating "You should be ashamed".
Der Spiegel reported that the Hotel quickly dismissed these charges, saying that the incident was a result of "disregardlessness" and "excusing" Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung said one of Kempinski's representatives had said "there has never been a direct order not to be included in Israel's fast-tracking list."
And he stated that they have now added the code.
Police use pepper spray and plastic bullets against Brazilian protesting students
Students gathered in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Thursday to demonstrate against the government's reforms to the public education system clashed with police.
Police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against protesters.
The problem began when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to police using plastic bullets and pepper spray.
Hundreds of students attended the show to express their displeasure with the plans.
Under the proposal of the governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools will be closed for savings and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools.
Some of the people who participated in the protest were seen writing against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest protest took place a few days after protesters took to the streets in crowds in support of the deposed removed President Dilma Rousseff by the vote of the country's senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran rises to 71% - RT Business
According to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9% year-on-year with the lifting of sanctions.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies doing business in the country have been greatly increased in interest, the ambassador said.
As new companies prepare to gain access to the market, Russian companies maintain existing ties with Iran.
Of course, the further increase in trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, reaching $856 million, he said.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
This increase in trade was achieved by supplies for machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the envoy said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to come to Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran granted Iranian citizens 35,000 visas, most for travel.
Also, Iran was among the top 20 countries in the number of tourists visiting Russia for the first time.
We can say that the Iranian tourist record for last year's visit to Russia will be broken."
At the same time, relatively fewer Russians visit Iran; this is a matter that the envoy hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are well preserved," he said.
FETÖ cash from Izmir - Economy News
Interesting details about Kavuklar Group Chairman Abdullah Kavuk, who was detained for providing financial support to FETÖ, and Ahmet Küçükbay, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Küçükbay Group began to emerge.
FETÖ's financial resources 1 and 2 in Izmir were determined that Küçükbay and Kavuk's FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization regularly sent a large amount of money to the ringleader Fetullah Gulen with the courier each month.
It was determined that the money sent to Gulen was not deposited through banks, but sent through the organization's member courier.
On the other hand, 9 people were arrested in Amasya as part of an investigation into the FETÖ coup attempt, including Merzifon Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Fatih Altınay, and seven were released on the condition of judicial control.
30 thousand lira in pocket over 10 years
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's call to "take down interest" prompted the banks.
The campaign attack, which was first initiated by Real Estate Housing and then attended by GYODER, was proposed to include banks.
The proposal to lower the housing loan interest rates to less than 1 percent, which is considered a psychological limit, was also made by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
13 banks cut their mortgage interest to less than 1 percent.
It was the public banks that started the discount furia.
With the latest arrangement, based on monthly interest rates previously ranging from 1.12 percent to 1.29 percent, the consumer using a 10-year term mortgage will pay between $15 and $30 billion less interest.
TERCİH 5 İLA 10 YEARS
And how much advantage will interest reductions give to home buyers?
A person using a 10-year-term loan of 100,000 liras will have an advantage over the decline in interest of 30,000 liras.
The vast majority of housing lenders choose a 5-10 year term payment plan.
Interest rates are expected to drop further in the coming days.
Interest reductions will also have a positive impact on sales.
In 2015, housing sales increased by 10.6 percent from the previous year, to 1 million 289 thousand.
Sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million this year with a reduction in interest.
GYODER President Aziz Torun: Must be reduced to below 9 per cent per year
It's an important step for public banks to go on interest reductions.
They listened to our president's call and lowered interest rates.
However, this rate should be below 9 per cent per year.
If this discount process continues, we are also considering extending the $0.70 monthly interest campaign that we started for a few months.
Lamb Group YKU Özen Kuzu: Our campaign may take 3 months
The participation of banks in this initiative to bring vitality to the economy that we limit as a month may raise the issue of extending the duration of this historic campaign for at least another 3-4 months.
However, loan interest needs to go below 9% on an annual basis.
And with the positive psychology and unprecedented solidarity that this will create only in the housing sector and the real market, it is gratifying to see that every sector sacrifices in the purchase of housing for citizens.
Polat Holding YKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from banks
It's a good step for the president to go on interest reduction on his call to the banks.
Apart from that, there are a number of steps taken to bring the economy back to life in all sectors.
Campaigns by NGOs, the decision taken by the Central Bank, and all steps taken in this direction are for the country...
All banks need to put their hands under the stone.
Come to them as well, you join this mobilization, walk along the same path with us, together, we say let's give life to the economy by hand.
$5.5 billion investment from Sabancı in 1.5 years
In the first 6 months of this year, Sabancı Holding increased its net profit by 11 per cent compared to the same period last year to $1 billion 353 million, while its sales rose by 22 per cent to $17 billion 166 million.
Sabanci Holding Senior Manager (CEO) Zafer Kurtul reported that they invested $1.8 billion in the first six months of the year and about $5.5 billion from the beginning of 2015.
Kurtul said, "As a country, we have been through a difficult turn in the recent past."
"From now on, it's time to work and produce more for our country," he said.
2 year break from Kabatas to ferry enjoyment
Due to the "Kabataş Square Regulation, Transfer Center and Reconstruction of Piers" carried out by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IB), Kabataş ferry docks were closed to sea traffic for about two years.
A modern transfer center will be built on the coast of Kabatas to integrate sea, rail system and road transport.
Traffic will be submerged, ensuring uninterrupted footflow along the coast.
The tram and funicular systems will continue to operate for some time.
Ring flights will be launched to provide citizens access to Taksim, Eminönü, Beşiktaş districts.
The interest fell, the house increased
My friend, the manager of a public bank, texted.
It's always the same thing.
Interest is falling, house prices are rising.
Interest is rising, house prices are falling.
"That's what happened again," he says.
He describes the sensations that come to him because his work is about individual loans.
Contractors entering the 0.70 interest rate campaign organized by Real Estate Housing say they have increased prices in many housing projects.
I looked to see if there was any truth in it.
There's a lack of status, there's nothing more...
Meanwhile, I had a conversation with a contractor who attended the construction summit of our newspaper a week after the coup attempt of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization on July 15th.
The boss of a big firm...
When I heard from the contractor that I wasn't going to name it, I said, "Well, you're actually going to have to raise the prices by 10 percent," I said, "Are you going to be a coup opportunist?"
Following the coup attempt, with the campaign led by Real Estate Housing, the builders launched a massive sales campaign with an interest of 0.70 and a maturity of 120 months.
I admit, he put his hand under the rock before the banks, took the risk.
But since we are moving in the spirit of unity and solidarity to keep Turkey at pace.
The banks also backed your one-month campaign by lowering interest.
Then no one should be a raise opportunist.
And warn those among you who do.
President Erdoğan accepts Omar Koç and Ali Koç
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accepted Ömer Mehmet Koç, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Koç Holding, and Ali Koç, Acting Chairman of the Board of Directors of Koç Holding and Ford Otosan.
Erdoğan's admission to the press in the Presidential Complex took 40 minutes.
Call from BDDK: Complain to those banks
Mehmet Ali Akben, President of the Banking Regulatory and Supervisory Authority (BDDK), made a statement regarding President Erdoğan's "credit recall" warning against banks.
"If banks turn credit recall into an opportunism due to the conditions of the market and do it with different motives, we will certainly not allow it," Akben said.
We say to those who bring us such complaints and information, 'By naming them on the basis of the bank and the company, apply to the BDDK complaint line'.
In a statement yesterday, President Tayyip Erdoğan warned banks: "I say that when interest falls and loan opportunities are expanded, a new era will be opened in front of both our country's investors and our banks."
To refrain from lending at this time in our country means that banks that call back loans under false pretexts have set a line for themselves, and I want to announce that.
During the period when interest rates were 7-8 percent per year, banks made money from these jobs.
More than 500,000 Russian tourists expected
Ali Kızıldağ, President of the Association of Professional Hotel Managers (POYD), stated that Turkey-Russia relations had taken a positive route ahead of the July 15 coup attempt at the EXPO 2016 Antalya exhibition site, scheduled flights from Russia to Antalya started and a certain revival in tourism.
Stating that the meeting of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin excited the tourism sector as well as the sectors that trade between the two countries, "I expect that there will be very positive developments from both tourism and agriculture to food, from construction to textiles for all sectors."
Turkey and Russia are two very close countries, we have traditional relations based on years.
"I think that if we, as sectors, make very fast progress on this road opened by the leaders of the two countries, we can close the distances and go towards the targets as soon as possible," he said.
Kızıldağ, who stated that they estimate that the number of Russian tourists coming to Turkey would exceed 1 million if it were not for the coup attempt, continued:
But we lost a month in what we call the high season, so there's a shrinking of the target.
I still think that if charter flights start, we'll exceed 500,000.
It could also be the end of the season, or even the middle of November.
In such a case, additional flights may be placed towards New Year's.
I expect that this positive weather will be very well judged by the Russian people as well.
They also have a longing for Turkey.
With this momentum, I think maybe we'll push the 700,000.
Reddağ expressed hope for 2017 in terms of the Russian market, saying that if the two countries' relations as well as the Russian economy were to recover, the number of Russian tourists could rise again to over 3 million next year.
POYD President Kızıldağ stated that domestic reservations started small with the removal of the ban on public personnel, "There are returns on the cancelled reservations, new reservations are also being received."
"We have a hopeful expectation of a sacrificial holiday," he said.
"It would be great if we could bring 100 to 200,000 people from Iran in 1.2 to 2 months," Kızıldağ said, adding that the removal of the tour ticket sales ban placed by Iran on travel agencies after the coup attempt was also a very positive development.
Renew with existing credit?
First, find out how the new interest conditions that arise by meeting with the bank where you have received a loan affect your loan.
Calculate the cost of using a new loan from your bank at a lower interest along with an early closing fee (generally 1.5-2 percent of the fee used).
If you still have the advantage when you include all costs, you can apply for low-interest loan use.
No breathing for the lion!
The final champion Beşiktaş aims to enter the new season with morale by winning the Super Cup challenge he will play with Galatasaray.
Technical Director Şenol Güneş, who built all his plans on winning, said in a meeting with his students, "We have to play tempolu and aggressively."
"I expect a high pass percentage and 90 minutes of ball control from you," he said.
It was learned that the Şenol Sun, which did not intend to drive the players who kidnapped the training, especially Sosa, was uncertain about Adriano and Quaresma.
The experienced trainer has tried Necip on the stopper during the week, but if Adriano plays on the left back, Tosic will serve on the stopper.
The Sun, which would also make a choice between Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei, also had his students work a ball that stopped after a long hiatus.
Tolga will explode - Sports News
Galatasaray President Dursun Özbek answered the questions of the media members at the dinner held the previous evening by NEF, which sponsored Galatasaray, and his transfer also supported expatriate footballer Tolga Ciğirci, whose annual fee was also the subject of debate.
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK TO THE FOOTBALLERS
Stating that the football team has become much better than last year, Dursun Özbek said, "It's still not about me, it's about football players who need to talk on the field," and added, "I can't say anything."
Let me see the teams for two or three weeks, then I can say we have a chance to win the championship.
Waiting for an explosion from Tolga.
You'll see Tolga with her posture, her physique, she's going to explode this year, everyone will be watching with admiration.
Galatasaray President emphasized that they had contacted Mehmet Topal during the transfer period but would step in if he did not agree with his club and said: "We were not meant to be burdened so that our opponent would increase the price."
Mehmet Topal is a gentleman, a master athlete.
If he didn't agree with his club, we'd want to transfer him to Galatasaray.
REVIEW WITH BANK BORCHES
"We wanted to build a hall of 13,000 people," Uzbek said, noting that they would soon start building the hall next to TT Arena.
However, our President said, 'Make a hall of 15,000 people.'
We changed the project.
With the money from Riva, we'll close down the bank debt.
MAYES FOR US
Galatasaray President Dursun Özbek expressed his belief that his team, which closed last season by taking the Turkish Cup, would reveal its quality against Beşiktaş in the Super Cup final that he would play tomorrow, made his claim with a slogan in the yellow-red club.
"May is ours," said President Uzbek, who expressed his belief that Galatasaray would be the champion again after a year's absence.
The away ban has been lifted.
The Association of Clubs Foundation made a historic decision at its meeting yesterday.
At the meeting on the agenda of the July 15 coup attempt, consensus was reached to lift the away ban.
As of the new season, guest team fans will be able to take their places in the stands in the matches and the Beşiktaş-Bursaspor matches that 4 elders will play among them.
Göksel Gümüşdağ, the Chairman of the Foundation, said, "We have decided to abolish away bans in order to continue the unity and tie formed after July 15."
"We believe that this unity and solidarity is of much more importance after the July 15 Martyrs of Democracy," he said.
On the other hand, as a result of the vote at the Clubs Association Foundation, it was stated that the current board of directors would continue to function.
Galatasaray Club President Dursun Özbek was elected president of the divan.
Unlike previous meetings, it was noted that club streamers were not included at the table.
In order to emphasize Turkey's unity and unity, the table was equipped with Turkish flags.
"WE'LL CLEAN OUR OWN STORY"
"We do not have the luxury of underestimating FETÖ formation," said Club Association President Göksel Gümüşdağ, who stated that those who tried a treacherous attack against Turkey's indivisible integrity found the great Turkish nation in front of them.
"As a football family, we have to clean and tidy up our own garden," he said.
Gümüşdağ said, "Do you think of an organization under the name of the July 15th Cup of Democracy?" and added, "There is a general opinion of friends, especially regarding the name of the Cup of Turkey."
"We will share this offer with TFF".
Target 25 thousand combined
Trabzonspor will compete in its new stadium in the new season.
Muharrem Usta, the president of the bordomavians counting the days to move to Akyazı, set their combined prices with his survey on social media.

F. Bahçe sent Pereira, a two-year signing on June 11, 2015, at the end of the first year.
President Aziz Yıldırım and the board held a meeting, including the club's Financial Affairs Coordinator Tamer Yelkovan.
The economic dimension of the event was discussed at the meeting.
As part of the agreement with UEFA, Yıldırım, who was sensitive to keeping "annuity damage" at a level, reportedly received help from Yelkovan on financial matters.
Representatives of Pereira have been contacted.
He was notified that his mission would be terminated.
2-2.5 MILLION ON EURO AGREEMENTS
There are still some unresolved points in financial matters, so the official statement will be made today or tomorrow.
Pereira and his team went to practice with the team yesterday because there was no official announcement.
The total cost of this operation was around 4 million euros.
However, it was stated that F. Bahçe would agree to a figure below that price for termination.
If F. Bahçe pays Pereira's fee in advance, he will finish the job at a figure of between 2 and 2.5 million euros.
If Pereira doesn't agree, his salary will be paid monthly.
If he makes a deal with a team, this payment will be waived.
Yes, in the end Pereira left, and the Fenerbahçe fan had a major revolution.
In the battle with Vitor Pereira, Caner Erkin, Luis Nani was martyred.
Robin van Persie was rescued slightly injured.
I'll be glad that Vitor Pereira is gone, I think our administration will go and find something worse.
My joy stays on my course.
Now that Pereira is gone, the champion is Fenerbahçe.
Vitor Pereira, you can go with your suitcase now with 3-5-2.
Pereira goes to Kadıköy on the 18th.
Serdar Çakır dismissed
It was learned that Serdar Çakır, a top ranking referee observer at the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), was dismissed.
Serdar Çakır, the father of our referee FIFA referee Cüneyt Çakır, who currently plays at the Rio Olympic Games, had been controversial in the referee community last year...
In the TFF recently, under FETÖ, the Central Arbitration Board (MHK), the Arbitration Board, and the representatives and observers' boards had been re-established.
The smiling face icon from Van Persie
In the minutes when Pereira's claim was made that his post had been terminated, Dutch star Robin van Persie posted a fabricated post on his Facebook account.
Robin van Persie, who shared photos of himself from Fenerbahçe practice, put the smile icon in a row with a football.
This sharing was interpreted as "happy with Pereira's departure".
The first independent gold in history was Al-Deehani's
Fehaid al-Deehani, who won first place in the double trap category in the 2016 Rio Olympics shooting major, brought his first gold medal to independent athletes in the history of the games.

I opened a door for the headscarves
Doaa Elghobashy of Egypt, who competed in women's beach volleyball at the 2016 Rio Olympics, said, "I respect those who played in bikinis, and my opponents are the headscarves."
Elghobashy stated that he wanted to break the perception about the Islamic religion that had settled in the West in recent years, "I have not had any problems with my chief coach at the Olympics."
Here athletes struggle with their abilities.
I get positive messages from many countries in the Islamic world via social media.
In particular, women say, 'You're encouraging us, we're proud of you.'
I opened a door for women with headscarves," he said.
Elghobashy, a 20-year-old Egyptian who sometimes comes to him and tells him why he wears a covered dress, said, "They understand when I tell them that I'm going out in this dress because of my religion."

FETÖ chief Gulen's assets confiscated
The indictment prepared by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic of Adana to provide financing to the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization by increasing the value of the immovable property belonging to the persons and organizations connected with FETÖ/PDY in an irregular manner in the zoning plans was filed against 17 suspects in the Adana 2nd High Criminal Court.
In the case where Fetullah Gulen, the No. 1 defendant, was tried for the crime of 'Trying to Eliminate the Constitutional Order', the tribunal issued a warrant for the arrest of the fugitives Omar Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu.
However, the court has decided to conduct fugitive proceedings for four escaped defendants who have not been caught so far and have not come to trial.
The Adana 2nd Heavy Penal Court then decided that all assets of Fetullah Gulen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were in the foreign country in order to ensure that the case against them was inconclusive and therefore could not reach him, should be confiscated "in accordance with Article 278/1 of the Criminal Procedures Act (CMK).
With this decision of the court, the defectors in Turkey, land-sea and air transport vehicles, all rights and receivables, valuable documents, company shares with which the partner was located, safe deposit boxes available and bank accounts frozen.
Hussain Gulerce: Gulen's fall hinges on the collapse of 3 feet
Commenting on FETÖ's coup attempt, Huseyin Gulerce made striking statements.
From Hussain Gülerce's statements, the heads of the lines are as follows:
As I had it in my mind that they would attempt a coup, I wrote about it in my writings for the past 5-6 months, "They can but they can't do it within the chain of command."
I didn't know two things; the first was that it was widespread and profound in this scale, for example, the eight-year commanding officer of the General Commander of the Gendarmerie, and the aides of the President of the Republic.
Mr. President is the most struggling person, who knows how he paid attention when choosing his sidekicks, but the most important feature of them is unprecedented secrecy.
They're so hypocritical.
One of the most important evidence for the statement, "This is not what a retired preacher like FETÖ can do" is that it is such a deep conspiracy.
He's definitely getting support from the CIA.
The CIA, this person, came in too early.
Mahmut Övür says in 2014 that they met Fuat East with Fetullah Gülen at Vehbi Koç's house in 1971.
The people who were most interested in these jobs at the time say that the relations between the MIT and the CIA were the closest.
The U.S. paid the salaries of our armed forces personnel, and one man came out after he didn't remember them.
When do we learn that, in 2014.
After this article by Mahmut Bey, there was no explanation to deny it.
Like the Fair Orphan, he got caught on the base, right?
Wondering who that is.
The man went to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the coup, returning two days ago.
The Fair Orphan has been abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you put all of this together, it has to be investigated which ones have gone to the United States under an excuse since March 1999, when all those who have fled now went to the United States.
It will be seen that they went to Pennsylvania on an occasion.
But their actual contact with the CIA can be identified here; there have been many people sent to the United States in safety, especially from people who need to be raised from within the law enforcement.
It's in the Wikileaks documents; it's setting up a laughing association, and it's having joint meetings with the CIA.
15 years before that, there was work to make those connections with the CIA official.
I told you Fuat Avni was an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The man who works for the Prime Minister works for Fuat Avni.
But the bad thing is that this information fell to the CIA as well as Pennsylvania.
Gulen's destruction depends on the collapse of three legs; one of which we call the base, which is a friendly ring, which is deeply hypnotized, they say that even this coup attempt is still Erdogan's film.
As I was saying, three feet, a base support.
The theft of questions, the theft, the defeat of the right to serve, shook this grassroots support very much.
The other two feet; political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing that would break political support is the documentation that tapes of Baykal and MHP executives were taken by FETÖ.
After July 15, "FETÖ" was also used by Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu, who opened everyone's eyes.
Laughing is a trickster who says, "I'm not doing it, I'm doing it."
He says on my side, "Yahu Huseyin Bey, these girl students have very different dreams, they send them to me, I have banned them now, because it is not right to act with dreams".
A recording had fallen, and the person speaking on that audio recording was Barbaros Kocakurt: My teacher friends had dreams, double the tweets of our Prophet.
1 police martyr in Nusaybin
According to information received, the armored vehicle in Saladin Eyyyubi Neighborhood, where police were stationed on patrol, was fired on by terrorists with long-barreled weapons.
A policeman was martyred in the first fire, a police officer was injured.
Two terrorists were neutralized in a shootout after the police responded.
The injured police were taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
Operations are underway in the area.
He stalled the hitters, TV broadcasts were not interrupted.
Private televisions, which had a significant share in preventing the coup attempt on the night of July 15, continued broadcasting in Turksat thanks to a technical staff who heroically resisted the coup plotters.
That's the hero Asim Akkaya...
Stating that they entered the psychology of resistance with the instruction to cut off the broadcast during the reading of the report in TRT, Akkaya said, "I risked everything by thinking that my friends were martyrs in the fire from the helicopter."
They wanted me to put a gun to my head and cut off the broadcasts.
I just turned off the local TVs.
Then I got them to walk away from the building, saying we had to go to the dish antennas.
I spent about 20 minutes in the section where the antennas were located.
"I cut some wires here again, but I didn't touch the broadcasts," he said.
When the coup plotters failed to cut the broadcast in Turksat, the Milky Way brought in the experts of TV.
These terrorists were captured by police who arrived at the scene three minutes ago.
When the coup plotters returned to the building, Akkaya said that he understood that TV broadcasts were continuing on the phone, which came to them about an hour later, and that he was at that moment confronted with death.
That night, I took over the evening shift at 8 o'clock.
We were entrusted with it.
One of my friends was on call for the e-government and the electrical system.
As we met for tea around 9:00 a.m., helicopters flew over us, flying low.
Around the helicopter there were again a few other aircraft flying quietly from below.
We saw their light.
It was probably unmanned aerial vehicles that could take images.
They were flying in front of the Helipkopters.
I've been there for 11 years, the first time I've seen such a close flight, so I called the order.
Then a movement began.
As we looked at the news, we learned that the bridge was closed.
At the time, our general manager instructed friends who were not on duty at the time of security to come to the building.
As we went to the courthouse for information, we learned that the packages of all their broadcasts on TRT had fallen.
For 5 minutes, TRT broadcasts were cut off.
I called TRT main control, but I couldn't reach it.
Our control station said that TRT broadcasts had returned and the statement had begun to be read.
Our Deputy General Manager Halil Yeşilçimen requested that TRT broadcasts be cut immediately on the direction of the general manager.
Since TRT broadcasts extensively on 3 channels, we started to work to cut the broadcast.
We've just heard Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım say, 'There's an upswing.'
Our principal's order to 'cut RT' got us into some resistance psychology.
We cut TRT off, and after a while we heard a helicopter.
We went out, the helicopter went down to the courthouse, shot everywhere, everyone scattered.
We hid in a building in the back.
There were 12 of us in total.
When we got in the back, the soldiers came in from the helicopter.
Soldiers caught a few of our friends.
We showed up so we wouldn't leave them alone.
At the time, I saw them catch our deputy general manager and bring him to his knees.
The soldiers were talking amongst themselves.
'Let's shoot one of them, let them be afraid' said one.
Then they put us all inside.
His commanders began to shout, 'Who's in charge here, I won't ask again.'
When we heard speeches like 'Let's shoot somebody', we thought, "We don't know about the country, but we got a directive, 'Stop RT.'"
So there's a resistance.
At that moment, I felt like I was giving up my own life.
I said 'it's mine'.
I stood up in that moment, not knowing what to do.
At that moment, all I could think about was having a shot at my friends at the station from the helicopter.
I thought 10-15 friends were martyrs in the order, and when I thought, 'They're going to kill us, too,' a comfort fell on me.
The commander in charge said, 'You will cut off all broadcasts except RT.'
We have the system section where we monitor local channels as they go to the satellite.
We are broadcasting 80 of the 200 local channels from the room in question.
I came up with this room.
There was no national broadcast between them.
If I cut these and I say they're all cut, at least by then, support will come and help from outside.
Or it'll go where it goes.
After all, we accepted that we couldn't get out of there.
I said, 'OK, I'll cut it.'
I cut off the antenna output of one of the local channel packages.
I cut the power switch to monitors that we can monitor national channels.
So all the screens would say no signal.
I told him I had to go to the antennas so it could be completely cut off.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, one of the soldiers said, 'Stop there.'
He put the gun on my forehead.
He said, 'You'll cut them all except RT, there won't be any left, I'll shoot one of you eventually, it'll be you.'
So now that I'm gone, he's comfortable saying, 'You'll see when you go, they'll all be frozen,' I didn't say anything else.
We entered the station, stalled and cut off local broadcasts.
We switched to the other antenna.
At the time, I had a system that would correspond to nearly 20 national channels.
About 20 monitors were wasted when they cut off the local channels.
Our Lord has helped us so much that we did not have any difficulty in answering it, and He has made their vision clear.
They believed our answers.
They couldn't handle it.
That's a relief.
After exiting the antenna, they asked about the location of the transformer.
I said, 'I don't know, I'm a TV broadcaster,' and he asked, 'Are there any electricians among you?'
I said, 'No electricians after the night shift, if there's a malfunction, the team will come.'
In fact, there was an electrician at the time.
It occurred to me that I didn't cut Cyprus publications.
I was thinking of cutting them off to stall the soldiers.
They were a little relieved that they thought the broadcasts had been cut off.
They couldn't reason to look at the publications.
Now the group is on hold.
About an hour later, when he turned on the TV in the waiting room, they saw the A News broadcast.
He went in, soldier.
'My Commander A News did not interrupt the broadcast', he said.
We were eye-to-eye with the commander.
He said, 'Stand up.'
I'm up.
At that moment, a soldier said, 'there are still publications going on.'
'There are channels broadcasting in Cyprus,' he said.
I said, 'They're broadcasting through Cyprus, we can't do anything to them.'
"Then he put us all on our feet after we had a conversation with someone," he said.
The coup plotters fled Turksat by van.
I saw from the photos that the soldier who took me to the bathroom and gave me water was executed in the seat of that van.
They shot him three times, shot him in the forehead and cheeks.
My friends confirmed that he was the same soldier.
They called that soldier 'son' with us.
Probably one who served in the military.
They may have executed him to get rid of him.
According to Asim Akkaya's statements, the first police team to Turksat came from Gölbaşı.
When police teams found out that there were helicopters in the vicinity, security guards were being scanned, they returned to the district to pick up ammunition.
They returned 40 minutes later.
When police teams arrived, Türksat was unable to see anyone in his foreign order.
"They called us from inside, we are Turksat personnel, we need to enter urgently," Akkaya said, noting that the so-called experts who were sent from Samanyolu TV only 3-4 minutes after the police arrived at the building.
"When the police asked for an ID, four of them rushed into their phones and told them we were 'caught' inside," he said.
The spirit of Dağkapı after Yenikapı
The AK Party will make an extraction to Diyarbakir, Van and Mardin in early September with a large delegation, including businessmen, artists, athletes and opinion leaders, to establish "volunteer bridges" with citizens in the region.
Following the bloody coup attempt of the FETÖ/ PDYci junta, the AK Party is preparing to move the "Newkapı spirit" formed by the bouts of democracy to Diyarbakir.
Prior to the Feast of Sacrifice, the CHP and MHP provincial heads will also be invited to the relief campaign in the Eastern and Southeast Anatolian regions.
The AK Party, which will give the message to the people of the region "State and nation are with you", will provide assistance to poor families and those in need.
At the AK Party's last MYK meeting, the Gönül Bridge Project, which was held for the first time in Ramadan, was discussed.
At the meeting, which evaluated the positive results of the project on terror-affected families, especially young people and children, the decision was made to continue the Gönül Bridge on the Feast of Sacrifice.
Works were started under the chairmanship of Vice President, Civil Society Public Relations President Mehmet Müezzinoglu.
Accordingly, 12 provinces in the East and Southeast will convene in Diyarbakir, Mardin and Van.
Meetings will be held before the holiday in these 3 provinces, which are accepted as centers.
The events will be attended by businessmen, artists, athletes and opinion leaders.
In these meetings, the organization of aid and work will be discussed.
On the Feast of Sacrifice, delegations of famous names will deliver the aid to the citizens themselves.
Children and young people will be given holiday allowance, and school needs will be addressed in this way as schools are opened after the holiday.
Victim meat will be distributed to those in need.
Following 15 July, the air of national unity between the AK Party, CHP and MHP against the coup will also reflect on this project.
CHP and MHP heads of 12 provinces will also be invited to the organizations, including the project.
Three parties will be provided to carry out the relief activities together.
It is considered that the HDP should not be invited to the events as in Yenikapı.
Fair Orphan's father-in-law spoke
FETÖ's father-in-law, along with Adil Öksüz's father-in-law, who was cited as number 1 of the July 15 coup attempt, had been taken into custody and referred to the courthouse.
His father-in-law Cevat Yıldırım and his mother-in-law Hatice Yıldırım were released by the court where they were removed on the condition of judicial control and a ban on going abroad.
Speaking at the courthouse exit, Cevat Yıldırım called on his son-in-law to surrender, saying: "I am on the side of the state."
God damn the coup plotters.
What I know is that I didn't really recognize the Fair Orphan that I've known for 18 years.
I don't have a son-in-law named Fair Orphan.
I want him caught as soon as possible.
In this way, he can neither live in Turkey nor live in the world.
Let him come, let him trust in Turkish justice.
If he made a mistake, he'll pay for it.
It bothers us to run away.
Shame on the police, shame on the state.
For 20 to 25 days, the police have not dealt with anything else.
Noting that Turkey does not want to return to Syria, Yıldırım said, "We do not need a coup, we need work."
We don't want Turkey to go and be like Syria.
Syria had a neighbour like Turkey.
There is a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He said, "What are we going to do with the coup?"
On the other hand, the last time the TEM Highway was seen passing through the Akyazı toll booths around 3 a.m. on 19 July, Öksüz had disappeared after leaving his 'SIR' license plate vehicle in the garage of his father-in-law's house in Akyazı.
FETÖ operation on university: 30 detentions
As part of the investigation in İzmir into the university structure of the Fetullahçi terrorist organization, the button was pressed for operation this morning.
In the operation carried out by İzmir Financial Crimes Department to İzmir Katip Çelebi University, 30 of the 40 suspects who had been detained were detained at their addresses.
Among the names detained in the operation carried out with the instruction of the Izmir Public Prosecutor's Office are professors.
The names taken into custody were questioned in the Directorate of the Division for Combating Financial Crimes.
The search for other names is ongoing.
Detained prosecutor attempted suicide
According to the information received, the District Police Department's teams wanted to detain the Viranşehir Public Prosecutor Ahmet Fishne in his office as part of the investigation.
Fishne then claimed that he would commit suicide by putting his gun on his head.
The receipt was persuaded by his colleagues and his wife who came to the courthouse to stop committing suicide.
Detained, the Fishne was taken to the County Police Department.
Smoking ban in parks and sports
Bilecik Mayor Selim Yağcı said at the signing ceremony held at the Sheikh Edebali Cultural and Congress Center that they added a clause to the police regulations to avoid smoking in parks, sports and playgrounds by the decision of the City Council.
Yağcı recalled that they met with all relevant public institution administrators to sign protocols for the future of new generations, wishing the protocol was good for children and young people.
Provincial Health Director Yasin Yilmaz also reported that protocol aims to get people to stop smoking and remove young people from bad habits.
Following the speeches, Mayor Yağcı, Sheikh Edebali University Rector Prof. Dr. İbrahim Taş, Provincial Director of National Education Facilit Durmuş, Provincial Director of Health Yılmaz, Provincial Director of Public Health Omar Balcı, Deputy Secretary General of Public Hospitals Serkan Kadir Keskin and Greenay Association Bilecik Branch Vice President Hilal Savran signed the protocol.
He saw the trapper in Ergenekon, killed FETÖ
Ankara's Chief Prosecutor's Office is investigating FETÖ's role in the mysterious death of Special Operations Director Behçet Oktay, whose file was closed in 2009 as "He committed suicide".
Ramazan Akyurek, former Chief of Security Intelligence, who stayed in the same quarters as Oktay and listened to Oktay under a false name six days before his death as a suspect in the Hezbollah Terrorist Organization, is the prime suspect in the investigation.
Some of the munitions seized as part of the Ergenekon investigation are alleged to have been stolen and buried by the FETÖ team in safety from the Special Operations Agency, which Oktay has identified.
The death of Behçet Oktay, then Head of Special Operations, who was found shot in the head in Ankara on February 25, 2009, was called a "suicide".
However, there were many question marks in the incident.
Two years later, a murder investigation was opened, this time as a result of the legal struggle and evidence presented by his family and family lawyers.
The pistol, said to have shot the left-handed Oktay himself, was in his right hand.
There were also fractures to the rib bones and traces of battering in his body.
The case for the murder investigation was filed in May 2012.
In the murder case, only Halil Cutter, who was with him at the time of his death and had a gunpowder trail, was tried.
The cutting trial was eventually acquitted.
Nurhan Önder, who was in prison for another crime and sent a letter to the prosecutor's office saying he was involved in Oktay's death, was sentenced to six months in prison for "accusing and misleading judicial authorities".
Those SAVCIS ARE ASKED
Meanwhile, prosecutor Hüseyin Yalçın, who called the incident a "suicide", retired while Mustafa Düzik, who conducted the murder investigation, was promoted to the Supreme Court.
The Oktay family, along with these prosecutors, want the autopsy prosecutor, Nihat Yıldırım, to be investigated.
Family lawyers with Behçet Oktay's sister Shule Oktay and his brother Nezih Oktay made many demands during the trial process.
The family, who said it was not possible for Halil Cutter to kill specially trained Oktay alone, wanted the investigation expanded.
The family said that the incident was covered, and prosecutors Hüseyin Yalçın and Mustafa Eğil and the police officers who wanted to close the Behçet Oktay case as suicides wanted to be identified and tried.
While all of the family's demands were denied, it was revealed that Oktay had been heard by the pseudonym "Abdurrahman Right" six days before his death as a member of the Hezbollah Terrorist Organization.
It was determined that the person who made the listening was Ramazan Akyurek, the then head of the Security Intelligence Department.
Upon this development, the Ankara Public Prosecutor's Office, which re-examined the Behçet Oktay case, began examining the finger of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization (FETÖ) in the murder.
The lawsuit against Oktay's illegal rest in Ankara's High Criminal Court will begin on 19 September.
THE BETWEEN IT IS THE FETÖ
The Oktay family, interviewed by SABAH, is hopeful of the current investigation being conducted.
Family members say the FETÖ finger in the murder was covered up during a previous show-off investigation and trial.
Sister Shule Oktay said, "This murder actually came to show off."
We didn't get it.
My brother said 'They'll eat me' before he was killed.
I said 'Who.'
That's when he pointed to FETÖ.
I was thinking he'd be dismissed.
I never thought of death.
There is, of course, FETÖ behind this.
"The administration at that time was in their hands," he said.
Martyr calls young man's family, joins his prayer
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan also called the family of Omar Can Açıkgöz, a democratic martyr university, through the AK Party Sinop MP Nazim Maviş, after addressing citizens in the garden of the Presidential Complex, during the last watch of the previous evening, when democracy vigils were interrupted.
At 1:30 a.m., when they prayed for his son, father Fahrettin Açıkgöz said, "Mr. President also attended with his prayers."
"I said that the health of our country and itself is important to us," he said.
'Your health is important to us'
President Erdoğan addressed the citizens in front of the Presidential Complex the previous evening.
Erdoğan met with some citizens in Külliye after his speech, which ended in the middle of the night.
Tayyip Erdoğan, walking along with an old aunt who was on a democracy watch, had a one-on-one conversation with the citizens, took care of the children, and thanked the citizens for their sacrifice.
Erdoğan then called Fahrettin Açıkgöz, the father of July 15 martyr Omar Can Açıkgöz, through AK Party Sinop MP Nazim Maviş.
Fahrettin Açıkgöz, the father of 21-year-old Omar Can, a student of TOBB University Law School, who was shot in front of the Presidential Complex, said that President Erdoğan called while praying for his son and martyrs at home at 1:30 a.m. "When I said we were praying for my son, Mr. President also attended with his prayers."
So I said that the health of our country and itself is very important to us.
"We are very pleased that Mr. President called and prayed on the phone," he said.
FETÖ's pyramid has fallen to the ground
26 FETÖ members were arrested in İzmir Urla.
Among those arrested is the Salvation Regent Hepyalçin, who, in line with the victims' statements, is referred to within the organization as the "integrate" i.e. the bully and threatens those who wish to end the Zaman newspaper subscription.
20 of FETÖ's elder sisters were arrested in Uşak.
In Bursa, 24 people, including former Bursa Police Commissioner Ali Osman Kahya, were referred to the courthouse.
DOCTOR IMMAMI HAPPENED
Aydin Tunbel, the organization's imam in charge of doctors, was arrested in Edirne.
14 of them were taken into custody at Denizli Pamukkale University, 30 of them were professors, 19 at Alanya Aladdin Keykubat University, 2 academics at Karabük University, and FETÖ lieutenant colonel Hilmi Sandal in Rize.
Eight judges and prosecutors and two deputy governors were detained in Diyarbakir.
It was learned that one of the judges was detained in the courtroom.
In Batman, deputy governor Şener Çağlar was suspended.
Two police chiefs were arrested from 465 police officers who were exposed at the Istanbul Police Department.
51 in Konya, 14 in Kayseri, 14 in Malatya, 10 in Siirt, and Naim S., the provincial imam in Adana, were arrested.
The traitor who shot the people was protecting the PKK.
Turkey, which has been fighting relentlessly to end PKK terror for more than forty years, has begun to emerge on the day of its failure to destroy the leaders of the organization in this struggle.
FETÖ militants infiltrated Turkey's critical institutions, working to tie Turkey's hand on all four sides.
At this point today, serious doubts and evidence have come to light that FETÖ is behind critical events such as the Hrant Dink Murder, the Uludere incident, the downing of the Russian plane.
THE SIGHS OF THE TRUTH ARE VERY WIREFUL
During the July 15 coup attempt, it was revealed that the record of FETÖ's Brigadier General Gökhan Şahin Sönmezateş, who led the raid and assassination operation on President Tayyip Erdoğan's hotel in Marmaris, was quite fluffy.
It had previously been determined that Sönmezateş had informed terrorists of the air operations to the PKK as the planes were taking off.
Investigations by intelligence units also determined that Gökhan Sönmezateş's record was puffy.
TERORISTS PROTECTION
In addition to leaking intelligence to the PKK, it was also raised that Turkish warplanes did not exactly hit the designated targets.
The MIT's point on the Kandil foothills regarding the leader squad of the terrorist organization PKK was claimed to have been deflected by Gökhan Sönmezateş, preventing the shooting of targets.
With the change of coordinates, it was determined that the fighters, which took off to destroy the PKK's leadership staff, hit the locations on the side of the targets, and the leaders of the terrorist organization were thus saved.
The intelligence review revealed that Sönmezateş played a key role in both deflecting targets and escaping from the location of PKK terrorists before the F-16s took off.
Opening file of 37,000 officers
After the suppression of the coup attempt by members of FETÖ under the direction of terrorist head Fetullah Gülen, the reconstruction process was initiated in the TSK and in the Ministry of National Defense.
Especially when it was discovered that questions of entry into military high schools were stolen by FETÖ, and that non-organizational military students were intimidated and sent from schools, a thorough cleaning process was initiated.
With the recent expulsions, about 37,000 officers from 39,287 officers will remain, while the cleanup for the general and admirals will also be carried out for these officers.
For this, promotions will be frozen, especially in cadres from lieutenants to the rank of colonel.
A thorough investigation will be completed before the promotion.
The files of 37,000 officers began to open one by one.
The FETÖ member soldiers will be revealed with a forty-shit study.
Officers who are not affiliated with FETÖ will continue their duties.
It is stated that the fight will continue until the last FETÖ member of the army is cleared, while the promotion of the officers will only be raised after the investigation.
The MIT, the Security Intelligence and the State Supervisory Board are conducting the investigation together.
As part of the investigation, the officers whose files have been filed are being investigated whether they rank as civilians or by finishing the war school, the promotions they receive, the places where they serve, and their commanders.
It will also be investigated by a hair-sharp study of whether or not they were FETÖ members even through their set-up.
Any measures will also be taken to ensure that officers with no ties to FETÖ are not adversely affected by the process.
If the slightest suspicion is found, that officer will be immediately suspended and referred to the judiciary.
Those who are identified with the FETÖ link, those who have information and documents about them, will immediately be cut off from the military.
While promotions are frozen during all these procedures, the review will be deepened.
The necessary measures will also be taken to ensure that there are no gaps in the post-export cadres.
Those who are expelled from the TSK with the FETÖ hoop and forcibly retired will be able to return to their professions with the same rights of ownership as their equivalent staff and circuit mates after passing the security investigation if they wish.
2 BİN 133 SUBAY REQUIRED
The Chief of Staff announced the number of personnel of the TSK as 39,287 officers on 1 July.
The majority of 32,289 officers in the officer class, consisting of lieutenants, lieutenants, captains, majors, lieutenants and colonels, were stationed in the Land, Air and Naval forces.
However, in the first wave of exports on 27 July, 1,99 officers had been sacked, including 726 in Kara, 314 in Air and 59 in Marines.
On 31 July, the decree cut off another 1,304 officers, including 125 from Kara and 909 from Gendarmerie General Command.
Pehlivanoglu: FETÖ poisoned Türkeş
Retired from the protections of Alparslan Türkeş, the founder and first chairman of the MHP, Tahsin Pehlivanoglu suggested that Türkeş was killed by poisoning and that someone in the family had done so in collaboration with FETÖ.
Pehlivanoglu, who was with Turkes at all times from 1977 until 1997, said, "I haven't told anyone yet, but I had to talk after watching that image of that soldier ripping pieces out of Muhsin Yazıçıoğlu's helicopter and seeing that the same soldier was inside the coup plotters tasked to kill our President."
Here's what Turkesh's bodyguard said:
We went to Germany in 1997.
We had a check-up with the headman three days before he arrived.
Check-up 33-year-old Burdur doctor Fikret said, "You're like an 18-year-old."
He said, "You've got nothing."
For some reason, this doctor died of a heart attack a month later.
We returned to Ankara on April 3.
My brother-in-law went to Amasya.
They called me on the way back and went to an engagement in Ankara Hilton.
After exiting the engagement, Türkesh tells driver Alparslan "Open the rear window".
He wouldn't have opened windows in life.
When you open the window, there's a sound called skunk.
First they did CPR, electrocution at the Çankaya Medical Center, but it was over.
We took it to the Bayındır Medical Center together, but it was too late.
I think someone in the family poisoned it in Amasya.
There was no autopsy on Turkesh.
His ex-wife Seval Türkeş will have heard my discomfort and rhetoric, which he made statements that went out to defend "Turkeş was killed" and so on.
A man makes a grave, he makes a grave.
They called it a heart attack.
The tomb of Turkesh must be reopened.
Was Alparslan Turkesh killed?
They were arrested while smuggling gold to Pennsylvania!
The operation aimed at the construction of businessmen of FETÖ/PDY in İzmir was confiscated during the shipment of 1.5 kilos of has gold to Pennsylvania.
In the operation, it was learned that there was another 30 kilos of gold that had been kept waiting to be smuggled to Pennsylvania in the searches conducted at work.
Following gold prepared to be sent to Pennsylvania in Eldem Kuyumcıluk, the workplace of businessman Mehmet Eldem, 3 people detained were arrested and sent to prison.
In addition, in the operation held within the framework of the investigation in İzmir, detained businessmen Mustafa Özkara, Ezel Elected and the Messenger Elected were arrested.
Mustafa Özkara, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Aegean and Western Mediterranean Federation of Industry and Businessmen (ESIDEF) and the owners of Batınak Transit Transportation Petrol and Tur. Tic. Ltd. (BALPET) had taken Ezel Elected and Elected custody in the operation organized by the İzmir Provincial Police Department's Financial Crimes Branch Directorate teams on 29 July.
While attempting to flee to Kyrgyzstan, it was determined that Özkara, the President of ESIDEF, who was captured at Izmir Adnan Menderes Airport, was the son of Osman Gürbüz Özkara, who was among the first trustees of Fetullah Gülen, and was one of the most important figures in the Aegean Region of FETÖ.
It was reported that all five fuel stations owned by Ezel and the Messenger Elect, other businessmen detained for allegedly funding FETÖ, had also been seized.
They stole a car in an hour and robbed three gas stations.
The incident occurred last night in the Eagle.
The two suspects, who arrived at the Eagle in the van they had hijacked, first robbed another gas station 300 metres ahead of a gas station located on the side road, then another station on the side road with a gun.
After the robberies were alarmed, Eagle police quickly identified the suspects and began a capture effort.
Police teams tracked down the vehicle used by the indictees, C.S. and U.A.
The suspects, who started to escape from the vehicle they were driving in the direction of Eagle Square, also fired at the police.
After a foot chase, one of the indictees was caught on Sovereignty Avenue.
Police quickly apprehended the second suspect, according to information from C.Ş.
The suspects were arrested and sent to prison following their proceedings at the Eagle Asayish Bureau.
On the other hand, the masked robbery was recorded by the cameras.
In the footage reflected on the gas station's security cameras, the suspect first enters the gas station, makes a discovery, then re-enters the market in the outside vehicle wearing masks and taking their weapons.
There is a struggle between the first suspect to enter the market and the market employee.
Following the suspect who went out with the attack by the market employee, the other person who was with him walks in with a mask and a gun to his head.
After disarming the suspected employees who pulled his gun, he escapes by taking $6,200 from the vault.
The top searches of the accused seized about 15,000 liras, an unlicensed weapon, and another vehicle that they had hijacked from three stations.
7.2 magnitude earthquake in the Pacific Ocean
The U.S. Geological Research Center (USGS) announced that the earthquake, whose epicenter is 109 kilometers east of New Caledonia Island, was recorded 10 kilometers deep in the seabed.
The tsunami warning after the earthquake, which did not cause loss of life and property, was soon cancelled.
Earthquakes often occur in Vanuatu, which is in the "Pacific Ring of Fire" earthquake belt.
He prayed for the unbeknownst to the coup.
The relatives of Çetin Can, 38, who was martyred on the Bosphorus Bridge on the night of July 15, are protecting their fortunes.
His wife, Fatma Can, said that she learned about the martyrdom prayer in a conversation that was held in the month of Shevval when they were not aware of the coup attempt that night, so she performed martyrdom prayer in the house and advised him to perform it.
After the prayer, Fatma Can said that they watched the news from television in the evening and learned about the coup attempt:
We got ready and went out together.
When we went to the bridge, there were people waiting there.
As soon as we entered the bridge, the tank opened fire on us twice.
We took cover, then we kept walking when the tank was gone.
There was a stop on the bridge where a large bus stopped.
It was crowded there.
We stood there for a while, waiting.
When we couldn't move forward, we thought, what should we do?
And Çetin wanted us to go to the side lane.
Once we got to the side lane, I'm guessing a sniper, we were a clear target, and he was shot there.
After four hours of praying, Çetin performed that prayer and became a martyr.
He didn't know about the coup.
The Wisdom of God.
God the Giver, God the Taker.
My wife once said, "If I die, plant a tree that bears fruit to my grave."
I made this wish by planting a plum tree at the head of his grave.
Fatma Can noted that they also owe thanks to President Erdoğan for visiting them, saying, "God bless him."
Skull and bone fragments were found in the plumbing excavation!
According to the information obtained, bone fragments came out of the soil at around 8:00 p.m. at Çankaya near the railway line at the intersection of Faculties Neighborhood New Ankara Street and Coşkunlar Street.
The employees and residents reported the situation to the police.
Police teams were dispatched to the scene on notice.
Seeing the 3 skulls and bone fragments that came out during the work of the work machines, the police notified the crime scene investigators.
Following the work of crime scene investigators, bone fragments were put in bags and taken to the forensic institution.
Residents claimed that an old cemetery was found where fragments of the bones were removed, squatters were built on top of the cemetery in the 1960s, and then squatters were demolished.
The investigation into the incident has been initiated.
The return of Rita's killer could take four months.
German hairdresser Rita Darı Winkler (39), whose body was found in Izmit Gölcük 34 days after she disappeared in Istanbul, said her boyfriend, a suspected murderer who was captured in Germany 4 months later, could take 4 months to return to Turkey.
Winkler arrived in Turkey on Thursday (March 3rd) to meet with his boyfriend Ali Kemal S. (46).
After meeting Ali Kemal S. in Istanbul Pendik, he disappeared on Wednesday morning, March 9, when he was expected to return to Germany.
As a result of research carried out by the Istanbul Police on the missing report of his family, suspicions focused on Winkler's married boyfriend, Ali Kemal S.
On 13 April, the report of Ali Kemal S. to the Sweet Hard Program with Müge Anli, which was broadcast on the atv screens, was reported to have excavated at the workplace, which belonged to his brother Hussein S., located in Gölcük.
A search was conducted at work on the notice.
Winkler's body was found buried on the floor of his workplace.
His brother Hussain S. (42), who was considered to have helped Ali Kemal S. with the murder and gave conflicting statements at the police, had been arrested.
Ali Kemal S., the suspect, was missing in Germany, where he lived following the discovery of Winkler's body.
The Hamm Attorney General reported that Ali Kemal S., wanted by Interpol in 190 countries, was caught walking down the street and did not resist the police.
The German Attorney General has announced that they have yet to determine where the suspect has been hiding, and that the extradition process to Turkey could also take four months.
On the night of July 15, it was revealed that the FETÖ coup plotters fired at the mosque to silence the sala read from the mosque near Akıncı Base.
SABAH reached its testimony during the mosque's imam's complaint "in the name of the holy ones" with images of the attack on the TAI TUSAŞ Mosque, the nearest mosque to Akıncı Base.
According to the information received, the coup plotters began shooting at the speaker directly from a distance of about 50 meters soon after the raft was read in the mosque.
One of the bullets hit the edge of the speaker with four cheers.
When the hitters failed to hit the speaker, the raft from the central system was read to the end.
According to the crime scene reports, the coup plotters who broke the door of the mosque and entered, with the intention of killing the imam, walked in with their mail.
Mosque Imam Mustafa Şeker said in his statement, "I am not hurt personally, but I want these villains who can even shoot at the mosque and martyr the people of Kazan to be punished in the most severe way."
Drug kills young people at festival
Two of the 5 people who were hospitalized at the youth festival in Istanbul Sarıyer last week were killed.
According to the information received, 5 of those attending a youth festival in Bahçeköy on 6 August were hospitalized.
The treated Brigade Ergin (19) and Gökhan Alataş (19) died.
The treatment of three people is ongoing.
Police have detained 5 people who are alleged to have sold drug pills to youths attending the festival.
Three of the five suspects who were transferred to the courthouse following their proceedings at the police station were arrested, and two were released for trial without arrest.
Research into the cause of death of young people is also ongoing.
In Burhaniye district of Balıkesir, two of the six youths who camped and used drugs by setting up a tent by the beach also deteriorated.
B.D., who was hospitalized, and G.C., died.
The other four youths were taken to the police department for their testimony following their treatment.
He detonated a bomb outside his estranged wife's house.
The 41-year-old M.Y., who lives in Bursa, detonated the homemade bomb, which he made in his own effort in front of the house rented by his wife, who left the house about 8-9 months ago due to severe incongruity, and increased the impact force by filling it with a marble nail.
Due to the explosion last evening, citizens experienced fear and panic, while the pieces of marble and nails in the apparatus were scattered around, causing the windows of many houses to break.
Anti-terror teams began work to capture the M.Y., who fled after the incident and was said to be unemployed.
Residents said the woman left the house about a month ago due to pressure from her husband and moved into the shelter.
Explosion in prison in Philippines: 10 killed
Senior inspector Xavier Solda, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prison Management and Penology, said 10 prisoners, two Chinese nationals, were killed in an undetermined explosion at Paranaque Prison in Manila.
Expressing that a guard was badly injured in the explosion, Solda said, "We have confirmed that there was an explosion inside in the initial inspections."
"Research on the cause of the explosion is ongoing," he said.
Before the incident, reports were examined that the prisoners wanted to meet with the guard when they found out they were being sent to another building, Solda said, saying investigators were investigating whether the explosion was part of an escape attempt.
Police official Jose Carumba told local media that the guard fired at the prisoners after hearing a gunshot, after which a nearby grenade exploded.
Curumba noted that authorities are investigating how prisoners who shot the guard put the gun in prison.
Explosions in Thailand
Three people were killed in explosions in four cities in southern Thailand.
The explosions in Trang, Hua Hin, Surat Thani and Phuket killed 3 people and injured 35 others, including tourists, officials said.
Police Spokesman Piyapan Phingmuang announced at a press conference that the bombings were not linked to terrorism.
"Tayland has no regional or religious issues with anyone."
"We think this is an act of internal sabotage," he said.
Cunta leader Prayut Çan-oça also told reporters that he did not want to comment on who was behind the explosions.
"We must focus on ensuring calm, peace and trust," he said.
Last year, on August 17, a bomb attack near Erawan Temple in Rajprasong, the commercial center of the capital Bangkok, killed 20 people and injured 120.
"Sleeping Cruel" to be executed by lethal injection
Lonnie David Franklin, 63, nicknamed "Grim Sleeper" (The Sleeping Cruel), was sentenced to death in the United States for committing at least 10 murders over many years.
Franklin, a former cleaning worker, was targeting prostitutes and drug addicts in their murders.
Franklin's judge, Kathleen Kennedy, told the suspect, "I've never seen anyone like you commit such monstrous and so many cruel crimes in my life."
Franklin is listed as one of the bloodiest killers in California's history.
It was learned that Franklin, who was convicted of deliberately killing 10 people and attempting to murder one person, would be executed with a lethal injection.
Precaution against FETÖ in Macedonia
Macedonian Minister of State Furkan Cakao said that they have taken steps to bring the extensions of FETÖ in their countries to justice as well as to initiate the investigations needed.
Recalling that the organization also has activities in Macedonia in the media and business world, "All this is known to the public."
The Turks here no longer give their children to FETÖ schools.
So we call on our people to no longer send their children here.
"This structure, which had previously benefited from the hospitality and exclusivity of the people, is well known to the public."
The sky will be the scene of meteor showers
TÜBİTAK National Observatory Researcher and Istanbul University Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences Assoc. Dr. Hasan Esenoğlu told AA correspondent that Perseid will reach the highest level on the night connecting Friday, August 12, to Saturday, August 13.
Esenoğlu stated that thousands of pieces were separated from the comet "Swift - tuttle" by the effects of sunlight and gravity and formed the Perseid celestial stone rain, adding that this would almost turn into a natural visual feast.
Esenoğlu stated that the Perseid meteorite was first discovered in 1862, and began to appear again on Earth from the 1990s.
"We need to watch such a visual feast from space, we need to take care of it," Esenoğlu said, voicing that Perseid celestial rain can be seen in July and August.
After all, this is a natural visual feast.
"It will help us to get to know the universe better," he said.
They'll shine white when it's cold, red when it's hot
Esenoğlu noted that some of the fragments that broke off during the meteor shower would fall on the earth the size of lentils, and continued:
Perseid temperatures can reach up to 2,000 degrees Celsius.
Because of the warming and friction in the atmosphere, Perseids produce red when cold in the natural environment, and white when hot.
Science can be contributed by writing down how many meteorites are seen on the website of the International Meteor Organization.
This data is of information value as it is collected from all over the world.
It can be watched all night.
Recalling that the meteor shower was moving at a speed of about 60 kilometers per second, Esenoglu said that this visual feast in the sky could be well watched all night long from places with little light in the northeast direction.
Stating that more than 100 meteor showers occur annually, Esenoglu noted that after the Perseid meteor shower, the Geminid meteor shower on December 4-17 was a nature event worth watching.
Little-educated, former footballer Erdoğan
Disrupting this balance was the winning alliance of the populist Islamists led by the undereducated former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the highly educated followers of Fetullah Gülen, a largely religious entrepreneur, who founded more than a thousand schools, dozens of universities and educational institutes from Texas to Tashkent.
The above is a translation of a sentence in an article published in Foreign Policy last week.
Erdoğan, a college graduate, is an undereducated and former football player; Gulen, a primary school graduate, is described as a wide entrepreneur, and these and similar articles, in which Gulen's followers are openly praised, are frequently featured in the Western press.
After that, they try to explain in their article "Why is anti-American and/or anti-Western sentiment rising in Turkey?" with sentences beginning with 'Because Erdoğan...'.
It is possible to think that analysts who view the anti-Western situation in Turkey as a nevzuhur situation in Erdoğan's time are unaware of Turkey's history.
In fact, according to statistics, the first decade of the Erdoğan period can be read as a period in which Western anti-Semitism in Turkey has declined or remained on average.
Because within this decade, there were good relations with the European Union and with the United States in sync.
Why Erdoğan's 'one-minute' and the PKK-like bombing of the Kurdistan Workers' Party of the Kurdistan Workers' Party of the Kurdistan Workers' Party of Turkey, the PKK-like bombing of the Kurdistan Workers' Party of the Kurdistan Workers' Party of Turkey, the PKK-like bombing of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, the PKK's failure to establish a clear policy and leave Turkey alone in the refugee crisis, the European Parliament's President Schulz's stance as "Erdoğan is not our interlocutor".
Let's say that while we lost 247 people as a result of the bloody coup, no support came to our democracy until the failure of the coup from our so-called ally, the EU countries and the United States, in Kerry's relevant first speech, they expected that 'peace and stability in Turkey' would be built, we forgot that there was no emphasis on democracy and the elected government.
So how will it be forgotten that many leaders from around the world, including Turkey, participated in the protest march because 11 Charlie Hebdo employees were killed in Paris, but that no president from any Western country that was 'allies' to Turkey, even though it was a month after the coup attempt in which 247 people were killed who resisted tanks for democracy?
What do we say when presidents or high-level representatives who come several times a year for the refugee issue send lower-level representatives?
How do we assess all EU and U.S. ambassadors not going to visit past because the window of the Hurriyet newspaper has been broken and not visiting a solidarity visit to the bombed-out Turkish Grand National Assembly?
If it is remembered that the EU shook hands with the coup leader Sisi in the first two weeks of the coup, sending high-level representatives to Egypt, and glorifying the coup administration by saying 'democracy is being rebuilt' in Kerry's visit after the coup, is it too abnormal that Western countries who have refused to support Turkey in its resistance to democracy are not sincere in Turkey to express their concern for Turkish democracy at every opportunity?
However, even allowing Gulen to live freely in the United States, which 95% of the people consider to be responsible for the coup, is now enough to infuriate the Turkish people.
If the background I have listed above is added to this, I think it is clear that the rising West/American opposition is simply a situation that cannot be explained by Erdogan.
Moreover, Erdoğan did not even say that he still thought there was a U.S. influence in the coup...
So the crate was never a referendum.
Can the Gezi intelligentsia, who despise their own people, who say, "The Ark is the Referruat," who despise voters who do not think like themselves, and who insult them as "the ignorant who scratch their stomachs" play from the same wire after the night of July 15th?
After seeing how these people have embraced the state and democracy, have they sought the answer to the question, "Where were we wrong?"
But there are so many questions that need to be answered.
Being a traitor Until yesterday, officers who served at various levels and were given the right to use the state's weapons suddenly agreed to enter the status of "traitor" and sought asylum from foreign states.
We need to see how we live in an environment of mental distortion, and how obsessions with individuals lead people to behavior that would be characterized as perversion.
As for the watered-up brains coup attempt...
For those who participated in this action, was there any point of view beyond comparing Turkey's cities to Syria's?
Why would an officer bomb his own country's parliament?
We should not have fallen into the illusion of expecting reasonable behavior from the brains irrigated by FETÖ's curses.
Other responsible, but let's know that FETÖ is not the only one responsible for everything.
The cadres, who present politics as the profession of fighting, grudges and hatred, have also made necessary contributions to the tragedies experienced.
They who present themselves as "the light" have also led the masses to believe that all kinds of irregular behavior and even impudence are natural.
We've even seen how those who hate their own people end up shooting at them when they're handed a gun.
The way of democracy, the way we know it
I say something very simple: on the evening of July 15, in Turkey, the people gave 250 martyrs to the FETÖ's tufeyli, the hachi, the sergerde, and more than saved democracy.
But there are three periods behind July 15, 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and beyond.
There are three changes drawn up in these three periods: economic, social, political.
Social change prepared two major phenomena: the migration from the rural area to the metropolis and the transport of these migrations to the centre after being kept around the cities for a very long time.
I stated on Wednesday that this move was via the subway.
I also emphasized that whether you call it a subway or not is the most important element of social change.
The second major change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
The contribution of road and bridge to modernization is more easily understood.
The road comes, the economic and social structure changes.
In us, it has changed so much political structure.
I have identified this history with bridges thrown over the Bosphorus in Istanbul since then.
Demirel built the Bosphorus Bridge.
This was the height of the post-1950 peasant movement in the 1960s.
Özal continued his progress in the same direction with the second bridge, which we now change its name to the July 15 Martyrs' Bridge.
Even the road routes of these show the relationship established between the environment-center.
It is also a sign of what kind of social change course is being followed.
The purpose of Demirel and Özal was to dissolve large masses in the center.
It was to adopt the ideology of the centre to them.
The AK Party did not build the third bridge for many years.
Because migration was driving at full speed.
The incoming people were placed in satellite cities.
A somewhat closed system was created in those areas.
Local governments with the AK Party have given people transcendence, jobs, social status, and they vote for the AK Party.
Thus, they were not asked to melt in the center of the masses, but to acquire political consciousness in the environment, and to come to the center 'as themselves' after that.
This formation was related to the ongoing headscarf debates before the AK Party (1992-2002).
These discussions made the masses accept the necessity of conservative, conservative and provincial people standing side by side, not integrating with the centre.
The AK Party politicized the masses, incorporated them into politics, matured them, acting in the way I stated after 2002.
After that, notice now, with the construction of the 3rd Bridge, the democratic struggle on July 15 is concurrent.
Thus, history and sociology overlap.
Let me add another dimension to this: the AK Party's move, which I am talking about, is not limited to Istanbul bridges alone.
Something more interesting is happening: the AK Party now integrates surrounding cities with central cities.
This is provided through two bridges.
One, Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, the Çanakkale 1915 bridge.
Add to that the paths.
Turkey will now reach Izmir from Thrace via another route.
Do you know what this means, Izmir will be a different city from now on.
Let's say that the AK Party will take 'out' Izmir, which it can no longer get from 'inside'.
Bursa, now Çanakkale, now Thrace cities will become other human beings and social geographies.
That's it!
The martyrs of July 15 are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie in Fenerbahçe and a jolly workout
Fenerbahçe continued his preparations for the Grasshoppers match with his morning training.
The training, which started at 10:00 a.m. under manager Vitor Pereira at Can Bartu Facilities, lasted a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of core training in the hall, the players went out on the field, doing 5 to 2 ball grabs and passes with running and warm-up movements.
The training was completed by double-fortification matches in the narrow area.
Fenerbahçe will continue its preparations with his training this evening.
That person who complained to St. Lightning to Gulen...
New developments are underway regarding Operation Shikee against Fenerbahçe.
"A name from the sports world has raised Aziz Yıldırım's words about himself to Fethullah Gülen."
"One day on the plane, this person said, 'What are you doing with your Fethullah Gülen?'"
When this person quoted these words to Gulen, Fethullah Gulen attached them to Aziz Yıldırım.
Why did he put it on St. Lightning?
If the president of the club, which is the most fan of Turkey, is in this mindset, he can hurt himself.
He used the phrase, "The case of the bottle was to liquidate St. Lightning."
Following these remarks, a statement came from Faik Işık, one of the key lawyers in the case of the Shike.
He appeared in the Counter-Visibility program published in Işık Habertürk and explained the person who complained to FETÖ leader Fethullah Gülen.
Here are the words of the Faik Light:
Aziz Yıldırım says something to Ihsan Kalkavan about Fethullah Gülen.
Coming from Azerbaijan, on a private plane.
Aziz Bey is a witty man, who also sings in westernist sentences when criticizing someone.
Maybe those westernist phrases will bleed a little.
Some may react to those sentences.
These sentences are being raised somewhere.
The towels, the ummets, the fact that so many businessmen go there as if they were going to Hajj, Umrah, is not something to be tolerated with that kind of tolerance.
What they say is business, he criticizes it very heavily.
That's not the only problem, of course.
In the meantime, they also have a football team tryout.
The direct links of some footballers and managers from Galatasaray Club and Hakan Grateful...
Muharrem Usta: The subject of the match is different
Trabzonspor President Muharrem Usta extended his hand of friendship to Fenerbahçe.
Stating that Turkey's issue is the issue of all clubs, Usta said, "We are on the side of this country with 79 million."
We need to take a firm stance.
If Fenerbahçe has a problem with FETÖ, if it is unfair, I will stand behind Fenerbahçe.
"However, the issue of the match between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe is different," he said.
Victim prices announced
Karabulut said: "As a unit, we set the kilogram price of live sacrificial veal at 18 liras."
"We have also determined the price of the cow, which we refer to as the living kilogram, as 17 lira, and the living kilogram price of the cow, which we call the second class, as 15 lira," he said.
Noting that animals that would not be victims were also put on sale last year, Karabulut described what citizens should pay attention to when taking victims:
In animals in particular, earring should be noted.
It is also very important that the animal is healthy.
For this, they can check the vaccinations on the animal's passport while our citizens are taking victims.
In appearance, the victim must be alive and alive, and must have fluffed his feathers off.
And you shouldn't have any symptoms like saliva or snot on your face.
In recent years, we have also seen non-victim animals being sold and sold.
The animal, which is a sacrificial animal, needs to be 2 years old.
We can also understand this by looking at the teeth of the animal.
An animal over the age of 2 has teeth that we refer to as 'caps'.
But animals younger in age have not had these teeth removed.
As an image, the animal can be seen as large, but the valve teeth may not have come out.
Cover teeth are also noticed immediately, as they are already large compared to others.
Rize Airport to be built at sea
The second airport to be built in Turkey with sea fill will be Rize Airport.
Rize Airport will be built on a 266-hectare area between the Sunday district of Yeşilköy Village and the Girl's Tower location, on sea fill 26 to 32 metres from the coast.
Due to the excess depth in the construction of Rize airport, about 3 times more filling material will be used than used at Ordu - Giresun Airport.
As part of the project, an apron will be built with 45 metres wide and 3,000 meters long runway where 36 planes per hour can take off.
Rize Airport, which will generally serve passenger and cargo aircraft, is also expected to serve aircraft with composition class D, turbulence class heavy, takeoff weight of more than 150,000 kilograms.
The Rize Airport project, which will be tendered on 8 September by the Ministry of Transport Maritime and Communications General Directorate of Substructure Investments, will be held in the first stage for marine filling, runway, apron, taxiway, safety wire mesh, mendırek, PAT fields and environmental lighting works.
These jobs will cost $600 million.
After the infrastructure works, there will be superstructure works covering terminal buildings, with an expenditure of 150 million liras.
The construction of Rize Airport will be completed in 2 years and 9 months.
An 8 cents increase to your engine
Fuel distribution companies raised an average of 8 cents per litre of their engine, effective from midnight tonight.
According to information from the Petroleum Products Employers' Union (PÜIS), there will be an average price increase of 8 cents per litre of its engine starting on August 13, 2016.
Accordingly, the price of its engine, which is an average of $3.68 per litre in Ankara, will rise to $3.76.
The price of its engine will increase from an average of 3.63 liras to 3.71 liras in Istanbul, and from an average of 3.66 liras to 3.74 liras in Izmir.
The prices set by the distribution firms can vary in size according to companies and cities due to competition and freedom.
Fuel distribution companies had raised four cents to the litre price of their engine on Friday last week.
Here are the Galatasaray footballers in Gulen's conversation
It was revealed that Galatasaray and national footballers, who once had a stigma for Turkish football, were involved in the conversation of FETÖ leader Fetullah Gulen in 1996.
Among the football players who listened to Fetullah Gulen's conversation in 1996, Hakan Ünsal, Mert Korkmaz, Okan Buruk, Arif Erdem, Ismail Demiriz, Uğur Tübakeker and Yusuf Tepekule are clearly visible.
In the conversation, Gulen mentioned Galatasaray, saying "We scored four goals and won".
Said Alpsoy, known as FETÖ's former football imam, also recently told the daily SABAH that "the team was given a bonus when Turkey became the third in the world in 2002."
Emre, Okan, Hakan Grateful, Hakan Ünsal and Arif raised money from these premiums.
The money collected was $250,000 or $500,000.
Arif Erdem took this money to Pennsylvania.
"Laughing later, the eulogy to Arif was flat," he explained.
The national football players participated in Gulen's conversation!

Very striking statements about FETÖ from Robert Amsterdam!
Robert Amsterdam, an official of the Amsterdam&Partners law firm, who has legally investigated the international illegal activities of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization (FETÖ), wrote an article to the US magazine Forbes, sharing information on how FETÖ is organized.
Stating that FETÖ leader Fetullah Gulen led the organization from his Pennsylvania mansion, Amsterdam said that "when we look closely at how Gulen operates about 150 charter schools in the United States, it would be clear that the organization has a hidden advanced organizational capability underground."
Amsterdam said it had been tasked by Turkey seven months ago to investigate Gulen-linked companies and schools, stressing that what it has found so far is "shocking".
Amsterdam, in its article, gave the following views:
According to the information given to us by the expositors, the Gulen organization has a strict hierarchy in which instructions are conveyed.
These instructions are usually delivered at face-to-face meetings in Poconos with Gulen.
There is a management group (consulting group) of seven people on the hill.
This group transfers instructions to the advisory committee.
The instructions go from here to the imams of the region, the imams of the country, the imams of the region within the country, the imams of the region within the provinces, the imams of the neighborhood, the imams of the student houses (light houses) and the students.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers work at varying levels, depending on their positions and support within the organization.
Amsterdam reported that the organization opened 55,000 jobs worldwide, having the largest network of charter schools in the United States, with millions of dollars being given to these schools each year from taxes paid by American taxpayers.
Amsterdam wrote that much of this money was directed among the members of the organization and transferred to "chosen" subcontractors.
Amsterdam explained this process with the following examples:
Magnolia schools, based in California, were caught giving $700,000 for an annual service contract to the company, which was linked to Gulen and shared the same office.
Amsterdam cited the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma as another example.
Amsterdam noted that this school also paid the property owner an extra $3.1 million, as well as that the administrations of the school and the property-owning company were found to be made up of the same people associated with Gulen.
Noting that similar situations exist in the 46 branch Harmony schools that hold the largest place in the Gulen network, Amsterdam said that smaller companies connected to FETÖ were paid with software licenses, curricula, etc.
"These examples I have given show that about $28 million of American taxpayers have been abused," Amsterdam underlined that the work done within FETO has enriched each other.
"Moreover, this is just the visible part of what we've found so far," he said.
Pointing out that nothing has been done to prevent such incidents so far, Amsterdam recalled that the situation has worsened over the past period of time, with the Texas Department of Education beginning to investigate irregularities over all of this.
Amsterdam stressed that schools operate normally in sight, with many employees having no knowledge of what kind of corruption they are.
"But in fact, these schools work like snow machines for Gulen."
"Laughing then uses huge amounts of money for political donations in order to conceal their illegal activities," he commented.
Amsterdam, a former American teacher who worked in these schools, said that some employees in Gulen schools held separate meetings, transferring a certain portion of their salaries to the organization, "It is believed that Gulen members in the Turkish Armed Forces are working in the same operation."
The coup instigators were strengthening their positions over the years.
"But apparently a parallel force was gathering power behind the scenes while the army was functioning normally," he wrote.
Amsterdam finished her article as follows:
Policy makers in the United States have questions on their minds about the events of July 15-16 and beyond, and that's expected.
However, as the two allies address their situation at a diplomatic level, those in the state authorities individually must wake up to the fact that U.S. laws have been serially violated in Gulen's operations.
22 members of the judiciary in Istanbul on the run!
It was learned that 22 of the 648 judges and prosecutors who had been suspended by the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) on 10 August 2016 and who had been investigated by the Ankara Public Prosecutor's Office on charges of being members of the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization had fled Istanbul.
A detention and search warrant was issued by the Istanbul Public Prosecutor's Office on 11 August 2016 for 67 of the 648 judges and prosecutors who were suspended by HSYK.
45 of the members of the judiciary who had been searched by the prosecutor's office in their homes and workplaces were detained.
Twenty-two judicial members, who were not found at their addresses in the searches, were found to have escaped.
It was learned that the arrest warrant would be issued against these members of the judiciary.
Of the 45 suspects detained, 18 were reported to have been referred to the Justice of Peace on request of their arrest following their testimony at the prosecution's office.
The search process for 22 judges and prosecutors who were not found in their addresses is ongoing.

The Islamic way of cutting and sending DVDs to donors is through Kızılay's "Kızılay Model in Sacrifice" in which benefactors will be able to easily perform their sacrificial worship in accordance with their purpose and rule.
Thanks to this contemporary model, carefully selected sacrifices will be selected by the veterinarians of the Meat and Milk Institution, reading the names of the guardians according to Islamic procedures in the institution's modern combinas, and cutting off the first three days of the Feast of Sacrifice.
Religious officials, veterinarians and notaries will also be present in the sections to be carried out in accordance with Islamic conditions.

In 30 countries, the proxy slaughter of the Red Crescent knows no bounds, and the meat of the victims will be delivered to the poor around the world this year, as it is every year.
This year's victim organization will be held in about 30 countries, Dr. Kınık said, adding that there will be events in the Balkans, 7 in Africa, 11 in South Asia and the Caucasus, and 4 in the Middle East.
Kınık stated that they predicted a 50 percent increase in their foreign activities this year compared to last year, "The fees for our citizens who will give their power of attorney to the Turkish Red Crescent were set at $740 domestically and $475 abroad."
We aimed to cut in 5 kombinas belonging to the Meat and Milk Institution in Turkey.
We carry out these sections by fulfilling the necessary Islamic conditions in Turkey and abroad, with the methods proposed by the Diyanet.

Pay attention to this habit of children
Faculty of Dentistry Assoc. Dr. Bilgin Giray said that children are relieved with this reflex by making sucking a necessity because they cannot perform chewing at an early age.
Dr. Giray, who listed the reasons for the habit of finger sucking in children, said, "finger sucking is an event that occurs from birth to the age of 3-4."
Most babies suck their thumbs.
The child who sucks his finger to satisfy his or her need for sucking in his or her infancy will suck his or her finger to relieve and relieve the mother's breast longing after the age of 1-1.5.
"He can get bored and distract himself, when his sleep comes, when he is nervous, and when he leaves the mother, he can do finger-sucking behavior," she said.
Stressing that the lack of a mother-child relationship and the lack of confidence in the child at the root of the finger-sucking behavior seen at an advanced age lies in the fact that Dr. Bilgin Giray described the effects of this behavior on dental health with the following words:
Finger sucking behavior has a negative effect on the shaping of a child's tooth structure.
As a result of the pressures generated during suction, the upper teeth are pushed forward, while the lower teeth are pushed back.
This leads to the position of the lower jaw behind, disrupting the balance of the palate and tooth structure.
The physiological reflection of this is that speech impairment and closure appear aesthetically poor.
Dr. Giray pointed out that if there is no early solution, permanent teeth start to emerge in the 6-7 year period, a much more complex treatment process may occur. "We can protect our children from closing and joint problems before jaw development is complete."
"For this reason, the oral structure of children today, such as eye and hearing controls, needs to be kept under control," he concluded.
New pale in close vision treatment: Trifocal Lenses
Patients after cataract treatment naturally do not want to wear glasses.
For many years, multi-focus lenses have already been used to solve this problem in our patients.
It has taken the success of treatment in this area a step further with the recently started trifocal lenses.
The difference of trifocal lenses from other lenses is the ability to provide a clear view not only of the distance or near, but also at distances defined as intermediate distances.
Treatment of distant, near or intermediate vision disorders
The intermediate distance in visual impairments represents a point we often use in our daily lives.
For example, the dashboard of cars, the portable computers we hold in our laps, or the distance we define as 60-70 cm arm length are intermediate distances.
Thanks to the fact that trifocal lenses also fix intermediate distances, our patients do not need to wear glasses in any way, whether near or far.
Another advantage that trifocal lenses provide is that they also reduce nighttime complaints.
Eye Diseases Specialist Assoc. Dr. Volkan Hürmeric "The treatment of trifocal lenses for every distance vision treatment is no different from the treatment of normal cataracts."
Our patients who receive trifocal treatment will be able to recover from eye health with a 7- to 10-minute procedure.
And the next day, our patients can go back to their normal lives.
It is an operation that improves quality of life, especially for people who drive, have a lot of computer use, love to read, and live a more active life.
You can also apply to an ophthalmologist to find out if this procedure is suitable for you, which can be applied to any patient who has turned 18 years of age.
The varicose vein is not used for heart surgery!
The heir is a fairly frequent disease in recent years.
In the varice, where genetic affinity is a primary factor; long working hours, long standing jobs, and prolonged sitting causes increased complaints of heirs.
Are veins used for heart surgery?
I have an heir, questions like what to do if I have a heart attack in the future are also often wondered by people.
Here are the answers to these questions.
There are two types of veins in the leg:
1.The leg has a deep veins system, which we call the main pathway that takes dirty blood to the lungs and collects the actual dirty blood of the leg.
These are called deep femoral vein and superficial femoral vein.
Problems in these veins are more rare, the vein cannot be closed in their disease, and drug treatments are administered to keep these vessels open.
There is a superficial system of veins in the leg that leads dirty blood to the lungs and what we call the side pathway that combines with the deep veins system in the groin.
This system consists of veins, which we call two large and two small pure veins.
All four of these vessels may develop insufficiency and heirs.
The veins that can be used in heart surgery are superficial veins called large pure vein.
The absence of these vessels does no harm to the body, and they can therefore be used in heart surgery.
However, in order for these vessels to be used for heart surgery, the veins must be healthy.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
The process of surgical removal of varicose veins, or burning them by laser, also reduces the workload of deep veins and makes the leg healthier.
One misconception among the public is that veins, even if inherited, can be used as a substitute.
The varicose vein is never and never used in heart surgery!
There are other vessels that can be used in heart surgery.
Backup vascular systems that can be used in heart surgery are located under the rib cage, around the stomach, and in the arm.
Thus, it is inadmissible to hold the varicose vein to use it for the heart and to worry about it.

Uzbek's meaningful pre-Super Cup message
Galatasaray Sports Club President Dursun Özbek issued a statement ahead of the Super Cup Final to be played between Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.
Here are the words of Dursun Özbek, who pointed out the unity and draw in Turkish football:
Galatasaray and Beşiktaş, two long-established and two-favorite clubs of Turkish sport, will face each other for the Super Cup at Konya Metropolitan Torku Arena on Saturday evening, August 13.
This is not the first, nor the last, match in the competition of our two favourite clubs, which has left a century behind.
But it's a very vital encounter in timing.
As we all know, our country suffered a great deal on the night of July 15.
The coup attempt of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization/Parallel State Structure (FETÖ/PDY), which refers to our democracy, was overcome by the unity and togetherness of all sections of society.
That night, as a nation, we paid a heavy price.
We gave martyrs.
We have a lot of gas.
This bitter price once again reminded us of the virtue of democracy, the necessity and importance of the domination of peace and not of fighting in these lands.
That night, representatives of the Turkish sport also opposed the coup as one voice, one heart; together they were on the side of democracy.
In these critical days, we need the unifying feature of the sport more than ever.
I wish that this match, which coincided just before the new football season named after the legendary captain of our club Turgay Sheren, will be the starting match for the environment of love and peace in Turkish sport.
Regardless of the score at the end of the match, which will be played in front of the stands where Galatasaray and Beşiktaş fans will share in half, I wish that the winner would be our country and Turkish sport.

Scot Callum Skinner flies home as Britain closes gold
Team Great Britain trio 2012 retained their title from London, while Callum Skinner of Scotland won last night's men's race at the Rio racetrack.
Glasgower, 23-year-old racer, took the lead role adopted by Sir Chris Hoy of Scotland, and this young man prided himself on the legend as he returned home victorious in his acclaimed New Zealand suit.
At the event four years before Hoy took five of the six Olympic gold, Britain had taken a shock victory.
And despite Hoy's retirement, they repeated this by finishing sixth in the Race World Championship in London in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of expert starter Jamie Staff.
They did it just when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement also created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
He had already seen the potential that Scot had now realized, and the British coaches had not given up on Skinner.
Although Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who were champions with Hoy four years ago, broke the Olympic record in the qualifying round, New Zealand set that record again in the first round.
And the British trio fought a duel for gold.
Although Hindes was a little behind on his own tour, Kenny brought the team forward, and Skinner endured it.
Using a larger tool to slow Hindes itself down, Kenny and most of the transformation that allowed Skinner to keep pace was this strategy change.
Hoy watched them as expert commentators for the BBC, and when they got on the podium, Skinner caught the eye of Kenny and Hindes.
Skinner, 23, of Glasgow, said: "This is an honorary comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and announce my name.
We broke the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was really amazing.
There's no better way to win that.
Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a bad start after London triumphed with Kenny and Hoy in 2012.
He then reacted to this interpretation, and there was no way to make demands from Britain's rivals.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
Hindes said: "It was as if we were in London with all the flags of Great Britain in the station."
We're just a team that was formed three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world races, so it's really incredible to have won again at the Olympics.
This is just one event, one medal, for a nation that has won seven out of 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of progress we've made in the last five months, we have five more days ahead of us that will be successful on the racetrack.
Kenny's attitude shows that Hoy's dream of a repeat of three gold winning records in a single Olympics is not impossible.
This would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and himself was born on March 23rd (also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister, a British sports past sacred history), would reach six gold medals and one silver medal.
That's the same level as Hoy.
Kenny will be in the sprint race from now on; the race will start today and last for three days.
Bolton, 28, said: "For now, I'm just enjoying it.
Team events are always the best events.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, when you win alone, you feel lonely.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be given the title of knight."
Although this is only the event of today's medal, there is a lot of good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished first in the four-man, four-kilometer team race.
They completed the track in 3:51,943.
The world record set by the gold medal winner in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (22:42) will be set in the second episode today, and it is certain that Wiggins will draw all the attention.
Before the qualifying round yesterday, authorities had a dispute with the officials when they called on him to measure his height.
At the women's event, which will continue and be completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record for 4:13,260.
The Great Britain Team relies on the strong cycling team to take the reins and win many medals during the middle period of the Olympic Games.
After great dominance in Beijing and London, expectations were greatly reduced in Rio.
There have been many bad developments in the background, including manager Shane Sutton's resignation in April for sexism and bullying charges and the retirement of notable figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, the first night after the races on the track shows that Great Britain's epic reputation for finishing in perfect time could be re-proven this time around.
With the cancellation of the energy contract, the future of the Portland construction furnace is doubtful.
The future of the Portland aluminum construction furnace in Victoria and the work of hundreds of workers fell into obscurity after one of the plant owners announced the termination of a supply contract, leading to the cancellation of all supply contracts of the energy company providing the facility with energy.
This move followed a decision earlier this year by the Victorian government to ensure that subsidies were not exceeded so that the facility would continue to operate.
The 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland facility.
Any closure can cause up to 2,000 jobs to be directly or indirectly at risk.
And since the relative furnace consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's entire electricity, additional chain effects can also occur.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry shut down the construction furnace, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland construction facility is losing money and is at risk of closure.
These developments came after several years of speculation for the future of the facility, initially based on the strengthening of the Australian dollar and the recent cost of consumption of the facility.
The AGL, which supplied energy to the large aluminum trace furnace from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects all three other owners to move to terminate their contracts.
The vast majority of the facility is owned by Alcoa and Alumina's joint venture, and China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp companies own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, which means that the physical electricity demand of the base furnace will continue," he said.
AGL stated that the contracts are "risk balancing contracts" that must take effect from November 2016.
Since contracts have a 12-month termination period, they will be completed in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL will continue to expect contracts to contribute to the 2017 fiscal year as well," the energy company said.
The impacts AGL may have on potential earnings for the 2018 fiscal year and beyond are currently limited to adopting a strong futures contract stance for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL states that the value of their contracts in their accounts has already fallen by as much as $187 million due to "expectation of termination".
Alcoa said the decision on the termination of contracts "does not affect the ability of Alcoa to operate the reservoir or supply electricity to the reservoir."
The US company signed a 20-year contract in 2010; this contract was supposed to come into force in November this year, but has yet to explain why it has not withdrawn from this contract.
Analysts are on the lookout for the possibility of the closure of both the Portland base furnace in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle due to economic difficulties in the sector.
Responding to analysts earlier this week, AGL's operations chief Stephen Mikkels said Portland uses about 600 megawatts each year, and Tomago uses 900 megawatts of energy.
If both of these facilities are withdrawn from the market, it will cause a significant drop in demand in the [electric] market.
And as a manufacturer, that would not be a good development for us."
Not just the star of the Kardashian TV show; Kendall on the cover of Vogue's September issue
Kendall Jenner (20), the fourth daughter of model and executive mother Kris's Kardashian-Jenner group, is on the cover of the US Vogue's highly anticipated September issue.
Kendall, a Estee Lauder brand ambassador who appeared in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
Kendall wrote, "I cried when I looked at this cover in a room full of people I loved."
Following the unveiling of the cover, a scripted reality video was released, featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the bar-provoking Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite show-world uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest), which was odd (or just unique to the Keeping Up with the Kardashians program); the family who had forgotten their sister's cover in the video had then prepared a classic ending: they were actually preparing a surprise party.
Although this is almost the stereotypical storyline of every "birthday" episode of all children's television shows (Seacrest says at 8:00 a.m. in a cartoon bunny candor, "Did you think we'd forgotten you?"), Kris should have included the other girls in this promotion in some way.
With this development in the September issue of Vogue, it is certain that we are entering a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have passed her on to the Vogue cover (she shared the cover with her wife Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a success in itself.
Vogue's September issue was the best-selling issue of the year.
With its thickness reminiscent of a coffee table book rather than a fashion magazine, this number attracted the attention of many advertisers (Fashionista found that 615 of last year's 832-page volumes contained advertising content).
The release of the cover star is also a closely watched process; for the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked ahead of the official announcement.
Women previously featured on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has featured more "modeling celebrities" than "famous models".
Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar-winning ambassador to Dior, appeared on the cover in 2013, and the following year the honor was conferred on Lady Gaga.
However, even if Miss Jenner, described by the magazine as the "shining model" of her generation, was placed in the previous category, her surroundings could be said to be quite good.
These celebrities are not the relatives of famous people or reality show stars or today's teenagers who know how to make good Snapchat videos (though Jenner is all of them).
These are all women whose talent is legitimate, prominent in the entertainment industry.
On the cover of last year, Beyonce had one of the best times of her career with Lemonade's debut.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Due to its reality show history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be disturbing.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the sluts of the time".
When news emerged that Jenner was going to appear on the cover of Vogue, this thought resurfaced.
However, focusing on dissatisfaction seems to be unwarranted.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of Vogue's September Issue.
He's literally a supermodel.
He's in Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
Estee Lauder is getting you a foundation.
She, along with her sisters, is selling you her own pictures in payment-walled apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine, where she takes pictures.
And in his spare time, perhaps only to see his brother Kourtney and his children, he is on the reality show on television.
Community legal support centres turn down 160,000 people every year
As the sector prepares for the impact of more funding cuts on operations already under strain, over 160,000 people from the most vulnerable part of the nation are being turned away from community legal support centres.
In Queensland, three out of five people (mostly seniors, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, and others with no resources to combat unfair evacuation decisions) are turned down while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services, which have exhausted their possibilities, are preparing for further interruptions.
Starting in June of next year, these legal support centres are scheduled to be denied more than 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrel, the Queensland Director of the Centers for Social Legal Support, reported that thousands of people were found to be being turned down every year in the National Association of Social Legal Support Centers' latest Census Report.
Mr. Farrel said the situation would be much worse if the federal government decision was not reversed.
"Queensland's community legal support centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands are unable to access the vital services they need," he said.
People who are in violent relationships, who are struggling with power and power to break up governance, families in the process of leaving, and workers who are unfairly laid off...All of these face problems with legal dimensions, and according to this report, they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents are forced to deal with more complex legal issues without assistance.
We urge Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to take back these funding cuts immediately so that people can get the support they need when faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the government fulfilled its promise to raise legal support funding to the national average level.
We should now look at community legal support centres and the communities they serve, and the investment the Palaszczuk government will make in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team sued after staff claims he pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team has been sued for not taking action after the North Carolina operations director was told to pull a gun on a staff member while traveling in a jeep in February.
The case was announced on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor on the state campaign team, in a lawsuit filed in the state court.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be taken care of from the inside, but later realized that "it won't happen".
As Bordini's complaint states, the Director, Earl Philip "brought out a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and held the barrel towards Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, Bordini learned that at least four other people had the same experience as Phillip after complaining to local and regional campaign team leaders.
Bordini said in a complaint, "The guns don't need to be fired to cause damage."
The case was filed two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused outrage at the North Carolina crowd, telling them that "the people of the Second Amendment" (as it turns out they were gun owners and arms supporters) could take action if their opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and she chose her own judges.
Trump's campaign team stated that the media considered these words out of context and that he did not support violence.
Bordini, with his complaint, seeks compensation from the campaign team for oversight negligence and Phillip for assault, battery, and spiritual damage.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not quickly return the message asking him to comment.
Efforts to reach Phillip were inconclusive.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services also did not receive a quick return.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial campaign.

"Report FETÖ" line
Following President Erdoğan's call for FETÖ members "may not know everyone, may not know security, report them", MIT and Police established a FETÖ hotline.
After the July 15 coup attempt, new practices are also being launched to identify "secret parishioners" who hide themselves while thousands of FETÖ members are being expelled from institutions.
As part of the work, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan emphasized the importance of the citizen's notices in the fight against FETÖ "Your friends from that community can be your friends, I say expose them."
You need to report to the prosecutors.
It's a patriotic debt.
"They may not know intelligence, they may not know safety, or they may not be able to catch up," he said.
As part of the work carried out, online tipping was started by the Ministry of Interior, the Directorate General of Police and the National Intelligence Agency (MIT).

Inspired by Bodrum, they built a 'example village' in Sivas
Canköy, in the Gölova District of SİVAS, was made an 'example village' in collaboration with the Governorship and philanthropist businessman.
In the village, whose roads were paved and paved with paving stones, all the houses were painted in blue and white, with the example of Muğla's Bodrum district.
The Gölova District Governorate prepared a sample village project to improve the image and quality of life of the villages in the district.
In this context, 66-digit Canköy was selected as the sample village, 12 kilometers from the district center.
The roads of the village, where infrastructure and superstructure services were increased, were paved and the sidewalks covered with hardwood stone.
The village houses with different shades of color were painted with the support of the businessman Selahattin Ayan, who owned Pelit Bakeries.
The entire village was painted in white and blue.
BODRUM EXAMPLES
Gölova Kaymakamı Erkan İsa Erat, who gave information about the study, stated that they had prepared this project to sign a study that would also be a role model for other villages and said: "It was part of our project that the village looked more modern, that the houses were all one color."
As we started this project, we looked for a place to model.
When we went to Bodrum, we noticed the white-painted and blue-windowed image of the houses.
So we wanted to take Bodrum as an example because of the cleanliness of white and its positive effect on people.
By doing our work, we had all the houses in Canköy painted in white and blue colors.
This work was done by state and philanthropic cooperation.
The project cost about $200,000.
With the work, our Canköy in Sivas became like a small Basement.
We want to continue this kind of work with our budget and again with the support of our businessmen.
Abdullah Macit, 66, the Mukhtar of Canköy, said that the village had a whole new image with the support of the Governorship.
Macit said that being a model village pleased them and the village people very much, and thanked everyone who made the effort.
Drug operation in Kangal

However, for four escaped defendants who were not caught and did not come to the hearings, the court decided to conduct illegal proceedings.
The tribunal then decided that all assets of Fethullah Gulen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were in the foreign country and therefore became fugitives in order to ensure that the case against them was inconclusive, should be confiscated under Article 278/1 of the Criminal Procedures Act (CCK).

The hedge fund under discussion is back on the commission
Turkey's Wealth Fund, which is expected to be among the world's largest funds, has been removed from the law quietly over objections.
It was decided to renegotiate because the fund lacked the control mechanism, but it was renegotiated on the commission without any changes.
CHP MP and Member of the Plan and Budget Commission Utku Çakırozer, who evaluated the Turkish Wealth Fund law proposal brought by the AKP to sozcu.com.tr, said, "We are strongly opposed to keeping this structure, which will consist of mandatory pension cuts from public-owned assets, labourers, employees, unemployment funds collected for the unemployed, out of constitutional control mechanisms."
The government's proposal for the Turkish Wealth Fund law, which it prepared in order to provide long-term funding for investments and projects, was removed from the bag law on Tuesday, with the opposition's view that it should also be discussed.
However, the AKP today brought the proposal back to the Plan and Budget Commission in the same form.
The CHP member of the Parliamentary Plan and Budget Commission, Eskişehir MP Utku Çakırözer, told sozcu.com.tr about the CHP's concerns and concerns regarding the Wealth Fund law proposal.
"When the establishment of this fund came to the Plan and Budget Commission within the bag bill, our former Finance Minister, Zekeriya Temuel, who heads the CHP delegation, expressed our concerns and concerns and proposed that this be removed from the bag law and also discussed in detail."
The Government, which accepted this view, had withdrawn the bill.
The bill came to the commission again yesterday in the same form.
"The government seems to insist that this be removed from Parliament within a week," he said.
"Our biggest concern in this law proposal is rulelessness," he said, noting that there should be a compromise on the issue of the Wealth Fund law.
"The assets that belong to the public, the laborer's mandatory pension cuts from employees, the incomes from the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, the revenues from privatisation, are transferred without rules to a structure that is outside the control of the Assembly and the Court of Cassation and has no responsibility whatsoever," he said.
Stating that Russia, China and Gulf countries where such funds are established have surpluses from oil revenues and trade, and that the fund is financed in this way, Çakırozer said, "However, we have a savings gap."
Therefore, the fund will consist of public resources, i.e. people's money.
A total of 100 billion in the unemployment fund is planned to be transferred from the forced individual pension fund to employees, 100 billion from privatisation.
"So this fund, which will be entirely made up of public money, must necessarily be under public supervision and this money should not be spent irresponsibly," he said.
Stressing that it is unacceptable for a fund to be excluded from Parliamentary control, where state resources are collected and state-owned assets are collateralized in its borrowing, Çakırözer described his concerns and concerns about the Wealth Fund law proposal:
Business and transactions relating to the collection, expenditure, debt on behalf of such a large public entity cannot be transferred only through the supervision of independent auditing companies.
There must also be public supervision and a transparent structure.
There are no provisions on the audit and transparency of the Wealth Fund by Constitutional institutions in the proposed law.
There is no limit to how much resources will be transferred.
No one will be able to ask for an account on how this fund is used.
Funding for major projects is cited as the goal of the fund.
There is no need to set up an unsupervised fund outside of the budget for this.
Why don't you put it in the budget?
And so, naturally, the question comes to mind, "Why are the SAıştaş and the House being evaded control?"
Stating that they are not opposed to the transfer of money accumulated in the Wealth Fund to investments, but that it is being done by non-transparent, non-accountable mechanisms, Çakırozer said: "It is debatable whether such a fund is needed."
But if the Government insists on it, then we have to ensure that the international standards that apply in other countries where such investment funds are established also apply in Turkey.
It must be structured in a way that the mechanism of control and responsibility is brought in.
It must be set up in such a way that it will not have doubts on it, that it will give the citizen the account of its own money used for it to the last penny.
Emphasizing that they are absolutely opposed to the Wealth Fund bill as it came to the commission, Çakırözer said, "We are pleased that the AKP is listening to our criticisms, especially in the House after the July 15 coup attempt."
In this law proposal, we hope that the AKP will listen to our constructive criticism.
We oppose the use of national assets without rules, the transfer of them, the irresponsible use of them, and the lack of public control.
"The desired Wealth Fund can only be useful if these concerns are addressed," he said.
It was learned that efforts were made to reach a compromise between the AKP and the opposition over the incoming law proposal.
"The sign of our confidence in Turkey is the investments we make"
Speaking at a meeting in Istanbul, Ford Automotive Chairman Ali Koç said, "The $30 billion investment we have made in the last 5 years is indicative of our confidence in the future of our country."
Koç Holding met with Acting Chairman of the Board of Directors and Ford Automotive Chairman Ali Koç at a meeting on "Trusters to Turkey, Producers in Turkey" organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO).
Ali Koç, speaking at the meeting, said, "With our partners, we are not only expressing our faith and trust in our country, but we are undermining it with our investments and actions."
The $30 billion investment we have made in the last 5 years is a sign of our confidence in the future of our country.
The essential considerations for Turkey to attract more foreign investment are a reliable and fair legal system, a democracy in international standards, a qualified workforce, and an ecosystem that promotes R&D, innovation, entrepreneurship, and added value.
Over the past few years, our government has offered our industrialists the most comprehensive incentives of our Republic history.
"I believe that with these incentives and holistic strategies, we will be able to launch a new "Investment Move" that we need.
Hüseyin Gelis, Chairman and CEO of the Board of Directors of Siemens Industry and Trade Turkey, said, "Now we know that no event is just a single country's problem, but as global players."
We came to Turkey with a long-term view.
If we are united and united, our problems will be solved.
We were able to bring to this land what could not have been in Turkey 160 years ago.
We will continue to be present in these areas in Turkey.
"Of course we will build factories, but we must have a clear horizon in this area," he said.
Turkey is one of the top 10 priority countries for them, said Shell Turkey Country President Ahmet Erdem, "Turkey is one of the top 10 priority countries for Shell."
We strongly believe in Turkey's potential and future.
We have invested in many areas, especially energy, and we continue to do so.
We thank our President, Prime Minister and Ministers for their support of international investors.
Trustworthy work is being done for international investors.
"This is in the direction of increasing our country's competitiveness," he said.
Sandoz/Novartis Turkey and Middle East Region President Dr. Altan Demirdere said, "On August 10, our Global CEO would come to Turkey."
However, the trip was postponed.
So we opposed it.
Because the CEO's arrival was crucial.
They made requests for a bulletproof car, protection, etc.
Then when he got here, he saw that everything was normal.
He left the guards and the car and returned happily to his country.
Investing in a country is like marriage.
First there's the word, if all goes well, you get engaged and get married with a long-term plan.
We are also married to Turkey and have no intention of getting a divorce.
Turned off the edge of the cliff!
Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım spoke to businessmen by teleconference at a consultation meeting held by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry at the Swiss Hotel on "trustees to Turkey, producers in Turkey".
Expressing that the sector that will ensure Turkey's comparative superiority is the industrial sector, Prime Minister Yıldırım said, "We should not miss the transition process to 'industry 4.0' in the industry sector as well."
"If we care about being the locomotive of our country and achieving the 2023 goals, we need to think about the industrial revolution, along with the IT and technology revolution, and achieve that as well," he said.
"Those who intended our country's future, those who tried to destroy its democracy, the scoundrels who didn't even hesitate to bomb our Gazi Assembly, if they were successful, we were talking about another Turkey today," Prime Minister Yıldırım added, adding that Turkey was returning from the brink of a great abyss on the night of July 15.
With the coup, we were going to talk about a Turkey among the 3rd world countries, whose administration was taken over, national will was eliminated and the world fell out of the developing countries league.
He said, "Thank God for the initiative of our nation, our Commander-in-Chief, the support of our President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the determination of our government, we have removed this trouble."
Prime Minister Yıldırım continued, "We will quickly come out of the impact of this incident and look ahead."
It is never and never true that we live by constant coup.
We have ambitious goals ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not shake the Turkish economy.
Chaos and crisis-seekers were once again wrong.
Today, our democracy and our economy remain intact.
Our banking sector, our financial sector, continues to work in a healthy way.
In 2015, the foreign trade deficit appears to have fallen by 25 percent.
The rate of the current deficit to national income was 5.8 per cent in 2014, down to 4.5 in 2015.
We aim to reduce it to 4 by the end of this year.
We will never change our tight stance on public finances.
Turkey's 2016 budget also exceeded the national income of 130 countries.
We reduced the budget deficit of over 11 percent to 1.3 percent in 2015, and we strive to maintain those rates.
We are better off in public debt than in the EU, in many countries around the world.
Our banking finance sector continues to operate on solid ground.
"Our central bank has not felt the need to issue currency to the market despite July 15th, and there is no reduction in our reserves, we have a gross reserve of over 121 billion dollars," he said.
"We are also making extensive arrangements for you to recover from your burdens towards the past," Prime Minister Yıldırım said, noting that they will provide all kinds of convenience for the development of the economy, increase production and create new employment areas.
We have implemented, continue to pass, many regulations until we have reached the point where the stock amnesty is kept to the vault surplus and the unpaid tax debt is repaid with ease.
"Keep producing for your country, keep relying on your country, and your government will continue to lift the obstacles in front of you one by one," he said.
Hakan Grateful's father hospitalized for high sugar
Sermet Thankful, the father of Hakan, who was taken into custody as part of the operation against FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization in Sakarya, was taken to hospital as a result of his sugar rising during the interrogation.
As part of the operation launched by the Sakarya Public Prosecutor's Office against the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization after the July 15 coup attempt, the arrest had been made last night about former national footballer Hakan Grateful and his father Sermet Grateful.
The father of Hakan Grateful, who was taken into custody in Adapazarı on Friday prayer exit today, Sermet Grateful was taken to the hospital while his interrogation was ongoing.
Sermet Thankful, who was hospitalized as a result of rising sugar, is undergoing treatment at Sakarya Training and Research Hospital.
Turkey not breaking up with the West, not giving up on the European Union
Mehmet Simsek: Turkey does not break away from the West, does not give up European Union
Deputy President Mehmet Şimşek, Minister of Science Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü attended the meeting on "Trusters to Turkey, Producers in Turkey" organized by Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO).
Speaking at the meeting, Minister of Science Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü said, "I think there have been many good results from the developments on and after the night of July 15th."
The most important of these is undoubtedly the spirit of unity and solidarity that all of Turkey now feels deeply.
The July 15 process showed how robust the Turkish economy has been, and how much the society has internalized democracy.
"For a society that has achieved this level in economy and democracy and democracy, it is clear that the next process will be better, easier and faster," he said.
"I NEED TO GET TÜRKİYE OUT OF THIS SINK"
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, who said they had trouble telling the world about the July 15 coup attempt that took place on the stand from Faruk Özlü, said that they had declared mobilization on the issue as a government.
"If 63.4% of the profits of the first five facets of my real sector go to interest, we must put all our work down and concentrate on it."
That's why our President is turning around and saying the job.
With the real sector, the banking system, its government, its politics, the unity and togetherness shown by politics after the July 15 civil Turkish democracy revolution, Turkey needs to get out of this trouble.
We welcome the recent developments in this regard.
"I hope that in the coming period, we will achieve its sustainability, continuity by supporting this competition, which started as a zero-point nine, eights downwards, initiated by banks with the encouragement of our President," he said.
"THE GREEN PASAPORT, WE WILL PUT OUR EXPORTER IN EMR"
"Win the world in the next period, we'll be scoops," Nihat Zeybekci said, "We won't leave a country that we haven't been to in the world under the leadership of our president, our Prime Minister, we won't leave a door that hasn't been stolen."
We're not leaving anyone we haven't contacted about increasing our trade.
"We will never and never ignore this; we will not be the birds at hand as we chase after the bird in the branch," he said.
Zeybekci also stated that in the future, exporters will be given a green passport, stating, "One of the most recent decisions, which is his law, is that we have now finished his regulation in the ministry of economics; about one of our exporters, as of the first figures, we will give the privileged green passport, which represents this country, to the order of our exporters."
"THE INVESTIGATION OF DARBE REQUIREMENT REQUIREMENTS IS REQUIRED"
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, referring to the July 15 coup attempt and the state of emergency announced afterwards, described the coup attempt as a 'cousus' and said, "But it's behind us, we need to look ahead now."
"Of course, those who attempt this coup must be cleared of the state, and this process is working; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms were needed in order not to face such coup attempts again," Simsek said, for two simple reasons.
As a climate needed for these administrative reforms, the State of Emergency has been declared, and so far there have been very serious structural reforms.
"While we have been doing all this, of course we have acted within the democratic principles and the rule of law, we will continue to do so," he said.
Expressing that life has returned to normal in many areas, Simsek stressed that there is not the slightest reason why companies and individuals who are not involved in the financing of terrorism should be concerned.
Simsek said that Turkey's democracy is solidified "I think the foundations of Turkey's democracy have been solidified because when you look at the origin of the problems in the recent past, you will surely see that this network of betrayal is involved.
"So the removal of this terrorist organization from the state, the closure of this period in Turkey, will strengthen Turkey's democracy," he said.
Şimşek stated that the basics of the economy were generally sound and that they returned to normal structural reform agendas without losing any time, "Turkey has returned to its original agenda, there is progress in structural reforms."
Structural reforms are already essential because there is growing populism, protectionism in the world.
"Turkey can prepare for the future only by reforming it," he said.
Finally, Şimşek stressed that Turkey will not break away from the West, saying that "Turkey may at times be at odds with our western allies, with our friends; but Turkey does not break away from the West, it does not give up the European Union."
He jumped fishing from 25 meters to the sea and...
In Antalya, 17-year-old Shamil Tayyar Bayrakçı was hospitalized when he jumped into the sea from the cliffs at an altitude of 25 meters, called 'Kartal Hill'.
Shamil Tayyar Bayrakçı, who was swimming with his friends in the evening on the coast of Konyaaltı, then jumped into the sea from the cliffs at an altitude of 25 meters, known as "Kartal Hill" under the variant.
Shamil Tayyar Bayrakçı, a professional swimmer, was injured by the impact of the impact on the water.
Having difficulty moving in the sea, he was brought to shore by his friends, who, like him, were also professional swimmers.
The paramedics who came to the scene on the notice took Shamil Tayyar Bayrakçı by ambulance to Antalya Training and Research Hospital following the intervention.
It has been noted that there is no life-threatening treatment for the treated Bayrakçı.
A friend of the Bayrakçi who testified to the police said, "His neck was hurt when he jumped from Eagle Hill."
He said, "We didn't expect this to happen."
25 dead - Spokesman Newspaper
The settlements in Sarmada Town in the province of Idlib, Syria, about 10 kilometers from the Cilvegözü Border Gate in Reyhanlı District of Hatay, were shot by regime aircraft.
Local sources reported that 25 people were killed and 40 injured in the attack.
Two separate air strikes were carried out by regime aircraft at noon and evening hours to Sarada Town, which is under the control of opponents near Syria's Bab-Al Air Border Gate, opposite the Cilvegözü Border Gate.
Local Sources said the airstrike targeted the planes' settlements and killed 25 people.
The attack, in which the blast sounds were also heard from Reyhanli, reportedly injured 40 people, is concerned that the death toll will increase.
President Erdoğan has chosen Kaya for YÖK membership!
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan elected H. Abdullah Kaya, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance, as a member of the Higher Education Council (YÖK).
"Mr. President, they elected H. Abdullah Kaya, the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance under subparagraph 6 of the Higher Education Law No. 2547, to the membership of the Council of Higher Education, which was vacated due to the resignation of Seyit Ahmet Baş".
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on the other hand, approved the "International Labor Law" No. 6735.
"The International Labour Law No. 6735 was sent by our President to the Prime Minister's Office to be published in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 89 of the Constitution and subparagraph (a) of Article 104."
Two brothers killed in shooting in Kahta
Two brothers, who were gunned down in ADIYAMAN's Kahta County, lost their lives.
The incident occurred on Mustafa Kemal Street in the evening.
The car, number 02 KH 839 under Ramazan Karahan, 39, headed towards the county centre, was fired with a pistol by an unidentified person.
The Karahan-run car, which lost control with the opened fire, stopped by crashing into another vehicle.
Meanwhile, the person who came to the car fired at Ramadan Karahan and his brother Omar Karahan, 50, in a row.
The Karahan brothers were severely injured, while the attacker escaped the scene on a motorcycle.
Police and paramedics were dispatched to the scene on notice.
The Karahan brothers, who were seriously injured, were taken by ambulance to Kahta State Hospital.
Omar and Ramadan Karahan, who were treated in the emergency room, could not be saved despite all the efforts of the doctors.
As the bodies of the two brothers were placed in the morgue for autopsy, police examining the mobe and security cameras in the area where the incident occurred began work to identify and apprehend the escaped assailant.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will offer renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and in London, but also across the country.
I think this will make Heathrow quite attractive, as it did in London 2012, where we have made incredible efforts to benefit all nations and regions from the Games.
The Olympics provided great advantages for Stratford and East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for locals and firms close to Heathrow.
10,000 new internship opportunities for our local communities alone will create 40,000 new jobs and we will not leave unemployed young people around the airport.
As before London 2012, there will be those who think that the fight to expand Heathrow is too challenging.
I was told that Britain would never prepare for the Games and that we would be disgraced throughout the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and will also be seen to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers all the questions asked.
As with the Olympics, Heathrow is not just an infrastructure project for a few people, but for many.
The expansion leaves the opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs and .211 billion of economic growth, and many skills and jobs both around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
From the T5 at Heathrow (which was named the best airport terminal in the world for five consecutive years) to the T2, we have a great team that has implemented an infrastructure investment worth .11 billion for the world's two busiest runways on time and budget.
We are now ready to offer a third track, backed by a special investment of â16 billion.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the United Kingdom, and I have no doubt that the Heathrow expansion will be as well.
By channeling this Olympic spirit into the expansion of Heathrow, it is time to secure our commercial future and create many skills and jobs that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton, chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Secretary of the Treasury Commercial
Adblock Plus "like a cat-and-mouse game" on Facebook ad blocking
Attempts to block ad blocking software for companies that make money from online ads resemble the "cat-and-mouse game" according to one of the companies that makes the software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that its users could update their filters to block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change codes around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to identify which part of the page is advertising.
Adblock, however, now says it has cracked new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this back-and-forth struggle between the community blocking open source ads and those trying to prevent them has been going on since the moment advertising blocking was invented," and it is possible that Facebook will be able to produce its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has gone through this challenge shows how much concern ad blockers pose for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, nearly 200 million people globally use ad blockers, which is four times the number of people using such software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
A spokesperson said that because mobile ad blockers are not effective on Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram for social networking, the company has been pursuing ad blockers on its desktop.
Since Facebook considers this kind of move to be worth the investment, desktop ads should still be in a position to generate sufficient revenue.
Again on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preferences" tool so that people can better control the ads offered to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were alarming, blocking some of the non-advertising content on the site.
A Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement, "It doesn't offer people a good experience and we plan to deal with that problem."
Advertising blockers are a blunt tool, so we're focused on creating tools like Advertising Preferences to give control to people.
A woman rushes into the Swiss highway; the incident seems to be suicide
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
Police are looking for people who witnessed several vehicles hit the woman on the highway early Thursday in what appears to be a suicide.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
Vaud police said in a statement that the woman was "hopelessly" lying on the ground in the dark of the night, and several vehicles hit her.
The 49-year-old Swedish woman, who was clearly in a desire to kill herself, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Police said they had been interviewed by several of the drivers involved, but some were undetectable, and asked them and everyone involved to apply for them.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve that "a criminal prosecution has been opened as a "reasonable" step to take in such cases."
However, it is not yet known if the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to avoid collision?
That's what the prosecutor needs to identify," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years indicate that drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases (both involving a person on the highway in the dark), the paper ruled that it was normal for drivers not to expect a pedestrian across the highway at midnight.
Last year, one night in August 2014, a police officer was found not guilty of causing death due to negligence by hitting a man lying on the road near Paynerne in A1.
In court, the 22-year-old victim was drunk and passed out on the road.
The court said that the police officer, responding to an emergency call, reasonably used the vehicle and the presence of a man on the road was "completely exceptional and unpredictable".
Those who have information about this incident, which took place near Morges on Thursday, should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once fit to live
According to estimates of the new NASA climate model, Venus once had life-appropriate conditions.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, water-free surface and atmosphere filled with CO2, was once home to conditions similar to those on Earth.
In the past, scientists have been explaining Venus' low rotation rate with a thick layer of atmosphere.
However, the most recent estimates suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and could still rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of ancient Venus.
Although more dry zones exist on its planet than on Earth, it may have once had enough water and protection against rapid evaporation with geographic variability.
Ancient Venus also benefited from a dimer sun at 30 percent.
GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a news release, "The slow rotation of Venus in the simulation of the GISS model made it possible for the daytime side to be facing the sun for almost two months at a time."
This caused rains that created thick cloud layers that moved like an umbrella that protected the surface from sun-induced warming by heating the surface.
As a result, average climate temperatures were only a few degrees colder today than Earth.
The model allowed Venus to create a story similar to the evolution previously proposed by planetary scientists as a hypothesis.
Although it once had life-appropriate conditions, Venus was exposed to a lot of heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Their oceans evaporated and the water vapor burned away by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen is depleted, and there is only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left with the deadly greenhouse gas effect; that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in their Geophysical Research Articles.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche antennae
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations, stating that the team had not been given a say in the decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic endorsed the development and stated that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have carried out my chief coaching and hockey operations vice president duties at Avalanche, Colorado, with energy, passion and determination," said Roy, 50, in his statement.
During the summer, I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could improve this team by giving it the depth it needed, and how I could get it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP hockey operations must be in perfect harmony with the vision of the organization.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
In the present situation, these conditions have not yet been met.
Sakic, who added Roy to the team on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick made me aware of his decision today," Sakic said.
We thank him for everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach in his first season with Avalanche in 2013-14.
He earned the club 112 points and made the team finish first, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the first round of the play-off period and missed the post-season games in both years.
Avalanche crossed the 39-39-4 target in 2015-16 and scored five points less than was needed for the second wildcard field at the Western Conference.
Roy, the goalkeeper on the Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups, two for the Montreal Canadiens and two for Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue talks by suspending strike
The North Sea oil workers' strike was suspended due to pay, and the chief negotiators began discussions for a new round of talks.
The strike against the oilfield services company Wood Group is being conducted gradually on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"As Unione and RMT unions with the Wood Group, we have decided to restart the process for resolving the current dispute," a joint statement said.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold a series of meetings that will take all day to adopt a new perspective on problems from the start of the next week.
Labour unions have expressed that this protest against wage cuts, which could reach 30 percent, is their first action in 25 years.
This year, Wood Group cut payments to its North Sea contractors by approximately 9 percent due to negative pressures on the market.
Following this fee reduction process, the company's contractors on the coast were also given a 10% price reduction in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would provide the company with the space needed to go through the distressed period in the market.
Shell laid off thousands of people while streamlining its operations in the process of merging with the British energy company BG Group and announced plans to discontinue oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low crude oil prices, an economic situation caused by Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Dave Anderson, a member of the Scottish Parliament, will meet with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labor conflicts in the North Sea.
As he himself said, the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
"We need an effective economy for the majority, not for the North Sea and the minority across the country," he said in a statement.
Despite an average investment of about $7 billion over the past five years, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea in 2016.
Kepler measured the rotation rate of stars in the Ülker team star
The Kepler space telescope, with its final mission, helped astronomers create the most complete catalogue of stars in the constellation Ülker in terms of their rotational velocity.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the constellation rotate at variable speed and why rotation periods are related to planet formation.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena, said in a news release, "When we compare our results with clusters of stars, we hope to be able to learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, age, and even the history of the solar system."
The Ülker team star is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Most of the stars in the constellation formed 125 million years ago and reach the new level of adulthood.
They rotate at the highest speed possible during their lifetime.
At peak rotation speeds, stars in this maturation stage form a large amount of stellar wind.
These winds have a refractive effect on stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to drop.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of noticeable starspots, such as sunspots.
The most recent catalog of rotational speeds suggests that larger stars spin faster than smaller stars.
Rebull compared the stars to dancers, indicating that the older ones performed their rotation on one foot more slowly than the smaller ones.
Rebull said, "In the country's 'bale', we see that the slow spinrs are much heavier, while the fast spinrs are very light stars."
Since the Ülker team star is very close, it acts as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing star properties and rotational speeds.
Rebull said, "The country provides theoretical models for the team star's stellar rotations in both directions as young and old."
There's more we want to know about how, when, and why the rotational speeds of the stars fall, and why, so to speak, they leave their 'dance shoes' in a corner.
Rebull and colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the Ülker team star's rotation speeds in three new articles that will be published in the Astronomy Journal shortly.
