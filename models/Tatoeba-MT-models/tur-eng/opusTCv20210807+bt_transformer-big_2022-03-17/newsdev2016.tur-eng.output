Norway's rakfisk: Is this the most fragrant fish in the world?
Five million people in Norway enjoy the highest standards of living, not just in Europe, but in the world.
Could the secret to the country's success be linked to the local appetite for some over-smelling fish?
Take a selection of past cheese.
Place these in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet football jerseys.
Leave it for a week.
Now you have the smell of rakfisk, one of the great Norwegian flavors that will numb your nose.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, gorgeous scenery – and that smell, it's always hanging in the air.
Rakfisk is salted and fermented trout in water - depending on how much fragrant fish you like - for up to a year.
When it's dark and cold, Norwegians gather here for a festival dedicated to this most fascinating dish.
"You eat it raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havarsen, a full-time local firefighter and so-called "Rakfisk General" Havarsen, who is in charge of organizing the festival.
People around us eat small fish cubes and sew a lot of drinks.
"Some people love aquavit more than rakfisk," says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid going under your nose, it's not bad – it's a bit like a sushi section after a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is a very different product of famine times when fish were kept in water and salt in airtight water barrels in the fall before Norway's refrigerator.
Then, deep in the winter, when it is thoroughly fermented, it is taken out and – no doubt – eaten with the senses destroyed by alcohol.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of jobs, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Now the population is expanding rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants drawn by the abundance of work, high salaries and a comprehensive care system.
People from Sweden, who are former competitors and much more recently wealthy than Norway, are flowing for business.
Rakfisk represents something important, a vital part of Norway's past, though a little scented.
It is among the most expensive foods you can buy.
But it's all expensive – you give a small glass of beer or a sandwich for a price of $9 per sandwich ($14).
Norway often doesn't come to the global news agenda – and that's how most people like it.
The people here are still reluctant to be mentioned as far-right racist Anders Breivik, who killed 77 men, women and children with a gun last year.
Instead, the killing event is called the July 22 event.
Norwegians find it difficult to believe that one of their own in peaceful countries could commit such brutality and murder.
Underneath Norway's wealth today lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're so good," says our waiter Anna Nordic, as she distributes her timely rakfisk trays with her long blonde hair and creepy blue eyes.
We are, how do you say, a humble people.
His English, like most people here, is impeccable.
We're not very showy, we don't like glamour.
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully – all but a small percentage of the money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone else was scattering money they didn't have, in the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway tied the ropes of its bag tightly.
"We're happy as long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer," Anna says.
"And as the rakfisk eats," he adds with a relaxed laugh.
I'm standing in the snow and waiting in line for something to eat – I've had enough rakfisk.
Now an elk burger is definitely something different and has a more delicious taste.
But there's more of that smelly fish in the evening.
One of the few venues where I stay is the hotel that organises a rakfisk dinner, where guests vote for the best – and perhaps the most challenging – fish.
There's a live television connection on a server with a bow tie surrounded by Rakfisk plates.
This is like a Eurovision song contest.
"How many points do you have for the best fish in the mountains there, Thor-Juergen?"
"Our points are here, Havard."
There's applause, there's laughter.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps under the influence of aquavit.
Or maybe from the smell of all these fish.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto faces tough start
As Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, prepares to move into the office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his people.
At the moment, Mexico's traffic is particularly bad.
When it was a cramped city at its best, it caused chaos on the roads, revealing a steel ring that had cut off various main routes in the capital since Monday.
The goal, however, was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will take over the presidential belt and take over the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Under the ongoing Felipe Calderon, Mexico had a good economic performance, but the country was in control of a drug war that killed an estimated 60,000 in six years.
"My government has a great promise to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama at the Oval Office this week.
I will present a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Mr. Pena Nieto's previous political experience before he shoulder-to-shouldered it with the US president was the governorship of his own state of Mexico.
The crowd surrounding the capital is divided over views of the new leader in this growing state, its former location.
An outspoken man
For example, he is fondly remembered in the rural town of Valle del Bravo.
Those who live here are credited with stimulating tourism and creating infrastructure at his resort.
To get to the town, you can go through the new highways of Mr. Pena Nieto, a great improvement over the altered cracks and bump roads.
Also named plaques hang outside the modern sports centre and the impressive museum of interactive climate change.
"We are looking at him to bring about real and lasting change," says Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a friend and political ally of Mr. Pena Nieto, a member of the PRI party's state congress.
We hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs especially in terms of security and economy.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the PRI was overthrown by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, there is a lot of expectation at the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.
And the opposition's new president refuses to characterize the essence as incomplete.
An outspoken man, dedicated to his vision of a great country.
He's a great statesman, and above all, a person who knows how to listen.
But that's not the idea that many people on the other side of the state have of their former governors.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the hardwood-stoned streets of Valle del Bravo could not have been sharper.
It's a suburb of Mexico City in many ways below highway overpasses.
And the problems in the municipality are difficult and urban.
This year, the military has been called in to help fight drug gangs that operate in neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly high.
An empty piece of land near a large landfill site has been dumped in the body of dozens of women killed in the past two years alone.
During his time as governor, Mr. Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexican state, far more than the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is known for the murders of innocent women, who are notoriously notorious.
Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto say he failed to adequately address the problem of female murder while on duty, even in the best way possible.
Worst of all, they accuse him of ignoring his administration.
In a typical concrete house in the Köhne neighborhood, Irinea Buendia tries to fight tears while showing me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, his family believes he was killed by his partner.
"When I went home, it looked like his body had been washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs of being beaten, and the severity of death had already begun.
As his mother retells the story, a picture of Mariana looks down the wall, next to a pilgrim with one word on her: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family said was denied.
State officials treated me like an old gossiper, troublemaker, nag.
What they want is for people to simply accept what they're saying and shut up.
"But that can't be true when there's so much disorder and lack of it," he says.
President Pena Nieto comes with heavy responsibilities as she takes the belt on Saturday.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has promised to give them priority during his tenure.
PRI congressman Olvera says in Valle del Bravo, "I hope the governor is a president as he is."
But this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning has not complained about misbehavior, prosecutors claim.
Prosecutors are trying to counter Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse.
The trial focuses on Manning's time in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Defense wants the case closed on the grounds that Manning's incarceration was harsh
Privates in the military accused of stealing thousands of classified documents
Prosecutors tried to state on Friday that private Bradley Manning in the military, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, had missed the opportunity to complain more than once about allegations of misbehavior during military detention.
While Ft. Meade cross-examined Maj. Ashden Fein Manning at the pre-trial hearing in Maryland, Quantico revealed that his weekly visits with unit officers did not show any complaints about the mistreatment of his records as long as he remained in custody for nine months.
The cross-examination in the defence movement to end Manning's case came a day after Manning testified that he was considering suicide while in custody, on the grounds that his imprisonment was harsh and he had received enough punishment.
An army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is charged with stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was later published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein examined the forms that officers filled out with Manning after a meeting with Manning while in custody at Quantico military prison, where he was held with an increased prison sentence from June 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, he reported that the behavior by Manning guards was "excellent" and that the behavior at the entire facility was "very professional".
Forms don't complain about misbehavior, although officers ask Manning about direct behavior, Fein claims.
Manning responded that he expressed verbal concern about the issues and that the visiting officers talked about their concerns and said they would turn to them, but did not record the issues.
Manning said that "it's okay" (after he mentions his concerns) and that it doesn't mean he didn't say anything."
Judge Lieutenant Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain to the board about the behavior he had expressed months earlier during the January 2011 meeting.
Manning responded by saying his intention at the meeting was to bring down the "prevention of injury" situation.
The military said they put him in a restricted position, one step below suicide surveillance, in order to protect him and others.
"I wanted something to know I was fine and I wanted to get out of the POI situation ... to enjoy an improved quality of life from my perspective," Manning said.
Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq on Thursday and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for about two months before being transferred to a military prison at Marine Base Quantico in Virginia in June 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait and fainted there once because of the heat.
He said it was stressful for him not to be allowed to know what happened to him and what happened in the outside world.
"My world shrank to that cage, Camp Arafjon," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
Manning said that when he went to Quantico, he spent most of his days alone in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours.
Manning said only one bed, blankets, flip-flops, some clothes and glasses were given.
He said he was trying to move because it was against the rules to sleep and even lie down during the day.
Manning always said he slept with the light coming into his eye from outside his cell.
When he returned at night, the guards said if he couldn't see his face, they woke him up and turned him around.
Manning's lawyer filed an official appeal against Manning's behavior in January 2011.
Manning moved to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
At the same time, on Friday, a claim he made to judge Manning in his statement on Thursday asked him about being forced to sleep naked one night in his cell in Quantico, being forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in a morning count.
Manning stated that he was not given a chance to cover himself with a blanket during the count.
On Friday, in an interrogation by the judge, Manning said he had removed the guard's order to throw a blanket that could wrap him up, but no one had ordered him to throw it away.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night due to his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to him.
Manning told the officer that his underwear could hurt himself using his waist tire or his flip-flops, but he didn't.
Manning stated that she was taken from the cell of her underwear, flip-flops and glasses that night.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his experiences in prison and greatly reduce his sentence if he is convicted in a military court, which is expected to take place at the beginning of next year.
Defense said they planned Manning would plead guilty to lesser crimes and fight crimes that were too extreme.
The trial was scheduled to resume later this week, with prosecutors expected to discuss the issue of guaranteed detention.
The Pentagon said Manning was held in accordance with the rules regarding all maximum detention prisoners in Quantico.
Those involved in assumptions against Manning are helping the enemy, causing intelligence to be falsely published online, transmitting national defense information, and theft of public property or records.
If convicted of all presumptions, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican American identity crisis
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity here.
Mexicans tend to condemn those who leave; they remind Mexicans of tough times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a close trip to Mexico City, I was forced through the crowd to the immigration processing area, stunned.
The signs indicated two rows: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, not sure where to go.
I've been called "Mexican" all my life because I grew up in central California.
In this ethnic stenoe, my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians."
Then I decided on Mexican American.
But, that was Mexico.
And my grandfather didn't need a steno or a hyphen in his hometown.
I was simply American.
I speak Spanish, I'm good enough to manage both sides of a conversation in this language.
But I don't have native words and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I got my U.S. passport and lined up for Extranjeros.
This week I thought about that moment when Mexico's elected president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
As always when leaders of the two countries meet on the agenda: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth in the Mexican economy, which is why his Mexicans are now as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to try to enter the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America.
Although Pena Nieto did not suggest anything specific, he vowed that Mexico would continue its war with drug cartels.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of negative emotions.
Most Americans probably never thought about the United States invading Mexico in 1848 and forcing their leaders to give up half of their territory at gunpoint.
But not minutes, but reminders are everywhere for Mexicans who think on a centuries-old basis.
So the moment a U.S. official says something a little bit critical about Mexico, you start to hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the elite that Americans have violated the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And Montezuma's children go to war.
And yet, the really compelling relationship for Mexico is with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about negative emotions?
There's plenty.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, the people that the country creates opportunity and the people it doesn't create.
The only reason too many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree a person, maybe a parent or grandparents, is out of opportunity in Mexico and has to go north.
And for the most part, this person fits a profile – dark skin, little education, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
It's not Mexico.
And even though we don't live the American Dream now, we can never overlook the fact that what we're living in is the American Dream, not Mexico, as we've gone to good schools and done good work.
Our identity may be uncertain at times, but our loyalty is clear.
to the United States.
We also recognize that most of the elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat, and they look down on us as if we were a subgroup that wasn't enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico are never strong enough.
Our existence is all about failure in their eyes.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, living well in the United States, but still lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, legally came to the United States as a child, reminding me that Mexicans hold on to who they are more tightly, and that there is a conflict between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexican Americans resent it.
Although a U.S. citizen, he considers himself part of the two countries.
At the same time, most Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of either of them.
We love to hear both Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both worlds, but you're not rooted in any of them.
We are seen as Americans in Mexico.
We are considered Mexicans in the United States.
Now, as I learned on my trip to further complicate the relationship, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reconnect with Diaspora.
To show interest in the United States, they want to employ Mexican Americans as temporary Mexican "priests".
We say what a beautiful country it is to visit Americans like us and force political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah.
That won't happen.
There's too much negative emotion.
And, with income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, most of us are not sure it's a great country.
I'm afraid you guys are on your own.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive Mexico for its behavior a century and a half ago, then they have to accept that some Mexican Americans still hold grudges for the behaviour of family members much more recently than that.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old wars, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be an unlikely basis for peace.
Can there be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another dump of blood indicates that such hope is in vain.
Among the usual inconclusive debates about who started it, numerous buildings were wrecked, killing more than 140 Palestinians and six Israelis, most of them civilians, and for the first time missiles from Gaza landed near Israel's major city, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab spring lifted the pieces up, and whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis were caught in regional turmoil.
Maybe this will make their struggle bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons to think that this could disrupt their lethal impasse.
A battle neither won nor lost
At first glance, it seems very difficult to justify optimism now.
Although the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continued, this week's war strengthened the atlas on both sides.
The Islamist movement, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim that Hamas leaders have forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has been defeated.
Despite killing some of its leaders and keeping the 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the worst and most populous corners in the world, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Of course, Hamas is winning the middle Palestinian fight in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its major rivals in Fatah.
Moreover, Hamas' leaders may conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas made strong and rich friends.
Turkey, Israel's once closest Muslim ally, has taken the aim of Hamas, and so has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
The joyous Hamas people say that an Islamist crescent around Israel has curled up into Syria, where the growing Islamist trend from Lebanon to the north, led by the Hezbollah military party, could bring down Bashar Assad, and that Hamas' allies have landed in Jordan, where they threaten the king.
Above all, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, which was by far the most populous and important among Arab countries in the southern wing of Israel, changed the balance of the region.
The secular tyrant Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is Hamas' cousin and its leaders are more of a public issue.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as an actor who cannot be thwarted even by Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's conservatives will draw the opposite conclusions.
Militaryly, it was put back in the Hamas box.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system proved valuable, and many of Hamas' missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more comfortably for a while.
Diplomatically, America is more determined than ever, with most European countries blaming Hamas for launching the latest violence.
Above all, Israel grew up under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has barely recovered from suicide bombers because of the barrier that landed in the West Bank, the main part of the desired Palestinian province, and maintained Jewish settlements that continued to expand despite international law violations.
While the Likud party is on its way to the January 22nd election, Mr. Netanyahu, united with Avigdor Lieberman's even more pro-war group, is at ease.
Why should these lying Palestinians be spoiled by giving their own state?
If they actually run the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and punish them when they raise their heads.
Perhaps the conservatives will win, yet the Arab spring can change their account.
Although Islamists gain power in Egypt and other places love Israel very little, their priority is to fight the challenges at home.
Israel's defence budget is larger than its Arab neighbours combined.
Starting a war with local superpowers does not help the new Arab governments to reform their economies.
Pragmatic Mr. Mursi has worked with Barack Obama to secure a truce that looks good, and perhaps they can make the start of something.
The Israelis must also look to the long term.
While the rest of the Arab world is more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to autonomy is creating a powder keg that will one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas, such as a bus that explodes in Tel Aviv this week.
In the Jewish state, repression is already undermining democracy, and demographics flare as the Arab population grows.
Every few years, bloody missions against Gaza to overthrow Hamas will reach a growing diplomatic price.
He needs outside encouragement on both sides.
The answer remains declared by most outside worlds on both sides and the sensible people who are this newspaper: the two states in which Israel represents the region for security.
In the short term, a small hope is that the truce will give a little more pressure to the foreigners who are pushing this goal.
Egypt, which now needs to start halting the flow of arms to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in a better place to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with land change and common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also force Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the impending virtual state proposal in the UN.
Mr. Obama also plays a role in bringing Israel to the table.
In the first period, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
He seems reluctant to be taken in at the White House.
This painfully does not see forward.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Smoking plain packaging laws go into effect in Australia
Smoking warnings and diseased organs are placed in plain green boxes for all tobacco brands
Australia's first laws on smoking and tobacco have come into force in the world, replacing brand logos and colors with generic olive green veneers, creepy pictures of diseased organs, and depictions of children and babies who are sick because of their parents smoking.
With the exception of various health warnings and images, the only difference between packages is the printing of brand names with the same small font that will be mandatory from Saturday.
This is the strictest regime in the world for the packaging of tobacco.
Australia's federal government says the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by stripping them of the habit of attraction.
This is based on research that shows that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26, they're 99% likely not to start at all.
"Even from a very young age, you can see that children understand that tobacco companies are trying to sell through brands," said Tanya Plibersek, the federal health minister, quoting studies that show, for example, that children associate the crown logo with the idea of being princesses.
Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, and while the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbyed harshly against the law.
Tobacco companies said they would support black market trading and lead to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia said, "The ban will have serious unintended consequences."
The counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say the law increases their business.
To the Sandra Ha cigarette boxes from a small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, the silicone cases to mask the unpleasant packets jumped almost from scratch two months ago when British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco in England, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the challenge to the law in the Australian high court.
He says Zico has sold more than 6,000 copies to wholesale locations and expects new stock.
It's a good job for us.
Experts say the potential disruption is the popularity of social media in the demography the plan is aiming for.
A number of Australian laws moved the tobacco market online after banning television ads and sports sponsorship, and asking most vendors to hide cigarettes from visible locations.
Australia has banned internet advertising from local companies and sites, but cannot restrict overseas sites.
Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney, said, "If you're in the tobacco market and there's only this little window left to promote your products, where you have to necessarily join is online."
Freeman stated that brands had an increase in "average human" reviews on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.
Is this a civilian citizen who really likes Marlboro cigarettes and goes to the trouble of making videos, or is a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focused on dealing with new rules rather than marketing.
The industry has advanced to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules, which claim that trade is unfairly restricted, although none of the countries in the World Trade Organization have significantly traded with Australia.
A WTO decision is likely to come out in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government is negotiating with other countries considering similar packaging decisions.
Canada was the first country to mandate photo alerts in 2001.
Now these have spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Most smokers in Australia are challenged.
The pictures don't impress me.
I ignore them.
"Take a cigarette and put it back," Victor El Hage said when buying a package with a photo of a mouth tumor.
To be honest, there's only one reason why I should quit, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who runs the King of Packages tobacco shop in central Sydney, said uniform packaging makes it difficult to stock shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to unload a delivery, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should have banned it altogether, then, OK, well, we're done, we're going to close the shop," he said, raising his hands in the air.
It's Not So Bad to Get Bored in a World That's Always Plugged in a Plug
During this Thanksgiving holiday, when our plane experienced mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane, I spent five unexpected hours at the airport.
So I had a lot of time to think about getting bored.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting for a half-day plane at the airport is quite tedious, even though there are distractions such as books, magazines, and iPhones (not to mention non-commissioned shopping).
But increasingly, some academics and child development experts praise boredom.
They say it's normal for us and our children to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go to interesting tangents, and perhaps it enhances creativity.
And most of us don't experience the benefits of being bored because we're plugged in from one screen to another.
So we should embrace boredom?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'm going back to that.
First, I assumed that being bored with the emergence of more free time, like so many people, was a relatively new concept.
Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Don't Squeeze: A Live History" (Yale University Press, 2011), says so.
"It actually has a very long history of getting bored," he said.
There's a first-century Latin graffiti on Pompeii's walls about getting bored.
Then comes the question of how to define boredom.
The problem is that this has been described and discussed in many different ways, says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues described boredom as a "willing but unsatisfactory activity".
He said that what separates being bored from being lazy is that one is not busy but wants to be.
There's no urge to do anything about it, he said.
The core experience of boredom is "disruption of the process of interest by low mode and the feeling of time passing slowly," he said.
Boring can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said they may be interested, but bored people tend to view the problem as the environment or the world, but depressed people see the problem as their own.
Sometimes we just think we're bored when we have difficulty concentrating.
Professor Eastwood and colleagues pointed to an ancient experiment in September in which participants listened to a recording of a person reading a journal article in their study "Unbusy Mind: Describing Boring in terms of Interest" published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television show in the next room, others heard it as being very little noticeable at a very low level, but the third group never heard the sound.
Those who heard of low-level television reported more bored than the other two groups, had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why, and associated this difficulty with distress.
Mark J. Fenske, one of the study's authors and professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, said that when you try to focus on a difficult or busy task, the disruption of interest causes distress.
On the other hand, when you read something boring, "like looking at bad vehicles on a factory band, the music that distracts you can help you not get bored."
In fact, squirming and scribbling, often seen as signs of distress, can make people physically more sober and struggle with it.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to be mobile learn more and learn more from children who are forced to stand still," said Professor Fenske.
We all experience adversity at some point, the delay of my flight, a monotonous speaker, a boring film.
But some people tend to be more bored than others.
To help measure this, researchers developed a "Treatment Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions such as "Most things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "I have a lot of interest, I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, found that using scales like these, researchers found that boys tend to be more bored with the need for a variety of external impulses, especially more often than girls.
In general, however, adolescents are a rather sluggish group.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he communicated with about 400 adolescents and their parents seven or eight times a day via a pager.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents were bored at school and doing homework, but 23 percent were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson has now said that after 21 years, he does not know if the squeeze percentages will be higher or lower.
He said, however, that he knew that it was "the peak period of boredom" since children and adolescents were not given much control over what they wanted to do.
So I go back to my first question: Is it good for a person to get bored?
Sometimes no, because research shows that when it's excessive, it can lead to people taking ridiculous physical risks, gambling, or getting involved in substance abuse as a way of reducing it.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who has been working on the subject for more than two decades, discusses the connection between boredom and creativity, he said.
Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U., said, "Constricting is the way your brain tells you that you should be doing something else."
However, the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch television, it can make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if you give him an iPad when your child is bored, he may not be bored anymore, but he doesn't learn to entertain himself or regulate himself, Professor Fenske said.
And he said, "This self-regulation is transferred from one state to another."
Your child doesn't just learn to entertain himself, he or she controls himself more in other areas.
I don't think we'd really like to be bored.
We shouldn't be too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to be comfortable away from the constant chitchat about activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood attended.
"We frame it as we need to be bored more, but boredom is the desire to be connected to something painful, uncomfortable, meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for is a way to get out of the plug and enjoy free time, he said.
"It's hard to find ways to be busy when the sound closes in an environment where we're constantly overstimulated," he said.
No Screenplay for New Marijuana Law in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, 19, a district college student and football player in southeastern Colorado is facing charges for something that will soon be legal in the state: a few pieces of marijuana and carrying a pipe to drink it.
Mr Orozco said one day in September that he and his friends had been stopped driving on the plains near the Kansas border in Lamar.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a call for minor offences, transport and narcotics, each with a $100 fine, and a court date.
"We were treated as criminals," said Mr Orozco.
But is he like that?
In the uncertain weeks of Colorado's vote to legalize a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of small drug cases depends more on location than on the law.
Hundreds of light criminal marijuana cases are being closed here and in the state of Washington, which has approved a similar measure.
Police units have stopped charging adults aged 21 and over for small-scale transport, which will be legally approved when laws take effect in the coming weeks.
In Colorado, however, prosecutors in more conservative areas have vowed to pursue current marijuana cases decisively and are still calling people to court for transport.
At the same time, several towns, ranging from Denver suburbs to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new state-licensed retail marijuana shops from opening in their areas.
"This thing is growing so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora's police chief in eastern Denver.
The regulators in Washington State are also scratching their heads.
And they're looking for guidance on setting up a licensing system for manufacturing, manufacturing, distribution and sales, with a deadline of December 1, 2013.
Colorado is now ahead of most states when it comes to marijuana regulation in recreational use, they say, first of all, medical use.
"Colorado has a more regular market, so they will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Board of Drink Control.
But no place or system could do more than suggest what would work, Mr Smith continued.
"There is no real example to watch," he said.
Washington's law, called I-502, will come into effect on December 6th, leaving a year of uncertainty where the state licensing system does not yet exist but legal transport will take place.
During this time, there are challenging mechanical questions to be solved, such as how the state will balance the directive "enough access" to licensed marijuana with restrictions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, children's parks or child care centers.
Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly formed research group Legal Hemp Center, said, "It can't be harder to have a licensed hemp business anywhere than city areas, especially Seattle's big city district."
On 21 November, Chief Oates in Aurora sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the city attorney "is about to take effect" would not prosecute minor marijuana violations for anyone aged 21 and over, and that police would stop charging people with these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would introduce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and would follow the drug trade and its dealers again.
In the Weld region of Northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a more rigid view.
After the vote, he said his office would mostly continue to monitor marijuana transport cases as a way of forcing users to seek treatment.
Currently 119 people are accused of carrying two ounces or less of marijuana, while many face other charges.
Mr. Buck said in a statement, "Our office has an obligation to prosecute crimes that are criminal at the time of their occurrence."
Even in places like the rural Mesa District, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, the response was complex.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the area, no longer sue adults for small amounts.
District attorney Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to close pending transport cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time on continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it would never be easy to bring recreational marijuana into the government and legal system.
And the controversial reactions that are common in the state reveal a profound dilemma among local authorities about the state's large green experiment.
Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing marijuana advocates and local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of the Marijuana Laws, says it is a "cultural barrier" with district attorneys.
"They've spent a lot of their lives suing people, so they still don't accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are ready to become national test cases for legalizing drugs.
Lawyers and government officials are also anxiously awaiting direction from the federal government, which plans to treat the sale and production of marijuana as a federal offense while planning a new frontier for legal sales.
Legalized marijuana lawyers hope the Department of Justice will withdraw.
Despite high-profile arrests by medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration, said that drug agents probably won't punch the doors to catch a small drug bag, but they are likely to stop them from allowing recreational marijuana stores organized by the state, which is allowed by new laws.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal officials to take action.
Even before Election Day, some local governments agreed to loan-delay new marijuana shops, which were about another year old, so they could be opened.
Last week, the western city of Montrose introduced a six-month ban and is likely to be adopted next week.
"We don't want to be licensed to someone and put in a situation where it's a big federal problem," City Council member Bob Nicholson said.
Our district voted against the amendment.
We're looking at the region voting against the state voting.
There are too many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I'm cut off from Oxford because I'm conservative
Only today's students are not being attacked because of their views.
I can't remember a time when I didn't dream of winning a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and older brother had found in my dream the two pillars of civilization in the modern wine-red Greek symposium, the best learning place in the world, in the place that promotes freedom of thought and tolerance.
But in the two weeks I was in Worcester College to study history in the late eighties, I packed my bags, started the first scandal of my life.
My father was devastated and wept.
The friends were stunned.
He claimed that I left the Evening Standard agenda because I disagreed with the fact that my undergraduate friends were having sex in the room next to me.
Author A N Wilson announced that I left because I was forced to drink from the broken cup in a witty way.
The truth was less funny.
I escaped.
Yeah, I ran away, because I was faced with systematic taunts and scares.
It's not because of my name or because I'm coming from private school that's a little weird.
I was judged for only one reason, and in the cradle of this so-called enlightenment, it was both backward and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was Margaret Thatcher's high-profile adviser, and I was supporting the Conservatives.
You may ask why I brought this up.
Recent reports suggest that the next generation of right-wing students are attracted to similar trials.
The institutionalized and growing hatred for conservative students at Oxford was so great that last week they demanded equal rights with a group of homosexuals, people with disabilities, and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's third-grade common room (JCR) claimed that because of their political views, they were "often actively left alone, personally attacked, and felt unwanted".
They want to create a publication on the university's equal opportunity committee so that their views can be freely published.
The new BBC Two documentary, Wonderland, did not help the situation either: it made the Young, Bright and Right conservatives look strange and neo-Nazi about student politics.
The former president of the Oxford University Conservative Union (OUCA) photographed recognized graduate Joe Cooke walking around with Rolls-Royce in a silver suit and silver-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "sin goats" for rising tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the University of Nottingham Conservative Union, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing discrimination in universities."
"Before we met, people think we're like Bullingdon Club."
Samuel Roberts, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed the movement for better protection, 21, says such an environment is "not comfortable", but Stephanie Cherill, 19, says that there is a deterioration in the attitude of the elected president of the OUCA, JCR members, towards right-centered people.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate and the presence of members," he says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a one-man minority.
In September 1986, at the age of 18, I went unsettlingly shy.
Hatred against the Conservative Party was at its hottest time.
The previous year, the university voted to deny the honorary degree of its former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in higher education payments.
This atmosphere would shake a pro-Stalin with fear.
During the first few days of the first week, students socialized with each other and with their lecturers, while I tasted the pain that would come.
In addition to ignoring the mocking of lecturers with conservative students, I would see them enjoying themselves.
The politics of opposition to the miner's strike, privatisation, and the government's sanctions against seceding South Africa had been brought to the wood-paneled rooms of education.
The first was about me translating 18th-century French texts into English, and I was unprepared for what followed.
"Mrs. Wyatt, please translate the first paragraph," said Harry Pitt, a lecturer.
I stumbled on it.
Pitt, a small man whose face looked like cake dough, had a lot of setbacks.
"Do the Chatcherists refuse to learn French, or are they just idiots?" he asked.
Other undergraduates giggled.
Tears hurt the back of my eyes.
"In your spare time, if you're not too busy socializing, I suggest you take basic French lessons," grunted Pitt.
I walked back to my room with a bitter face.
That evening I sat alone for dinner in college; then I felt a slight touch on my shoulder.
This was a sophomore English student named James, who introduced himself as an OUCA member.
He politely said, "I know who you are."
I'm afraid so.
He's dealing with anyone suspected of being conservative.
That's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be pro-worker.
Then, at a local bar, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Ms. Thatcher said.
This tactic proved his failure.
"You're the daughter of a fascist pig," said a freshman PPE student who had been to Eton, ironically.
You're contaminated.
The other students held themselves.
I was a pervert, dirty.
Someone asked, "How do conservatives have sex?"
They're beating each other up, aren't they?
I felt like gay people would have felt before the liberal legislation of the '60s.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Was I going to be forced to meet people who agreed only when it was dark?
Would I go back to the labor party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me stretched out like a purgatory of exile and loneliness.
Norman Stone was the only openly conservative Professor of Modern History at my university.
He was hated for being both conservative and one of Thatcher's foreign policy advisers and copywriters.
Very little was there.
From there he was disgusted by the fact that he was small and provincial, and because of his commitment to the Marxist view of needy history.
In 1997, he started to work as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
He told me, "You won't be happy there."
From Oxford, I started going to my parents' house in London, taking refuge with my more open-minded big-city friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
In his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not between my dream towers.
Even my communist friends always had excellent manners.
His moist eyes began to cloud.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure this is all a joke.
If you leave, I'll be heartbroken.
My emotional endurance, tired of my frequent visits to London, was weakening.
A conservative boyfriend of mine bowed to the pressure and rejected his faith.
The next week, during a training session, when another history lecturer said completely seriously that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
I admitted to being "brainwashed by my parents" and called them "old idiots."
The breathing was short-lived.
My father nailed the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, every week Murdoch was writing two columns in his publication.
My door was locked.
I choked inside, and five minutes later, the people who were after me gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a whiny wimp.
However, no 18-year-old should be subject to such intimidation and sarcasm in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that Oxford both expelled 14 conservative prime ministers and hid behind a reputation of equality and freedom of thought that it had not deserved to this day.
Flood in Trabzon engulfs two people
Due to the torrential rain that was effective in the Yomra district of Trabzon, İkisu flooded the stream.
Two women were lost in the village of Taşdelen, while the road to Sayvan was closed to transportation.
The body of one of the two women missing from the flood was recovered.
The rain was effective in the high part of Yomra around 3:00 p.m.
When İkisu carried the stream, about 200 meters of the road connecting İkisu Village to Sayvan Village was flooded.
İbrahim Karslı, one of the village residents who complained that the road was not started to be opened despite the fact that they informed the authorities, said, "The road has been closed for 3 hours.
We're going through the same thing with every heavy rain.
We've alerted the authorities, but no one's coming, no one's leaving.
Citizens are becoming distraught.
Every year we have this problem.
When the trees clog the stream, the water is on its way," he said.
THE CESE OF A PERSON
Yomra Mayor Ibrahim Değıroğlu reported that the body of one of the two women who disappeared in the flood, which resulted from the effective downpour in the district, was reached and the other person was still being searched.
Değıroğlu recalled that there was a flood disaster in the district due to the downpour that was effective yesterday, and that two women who collected nuts in the village of Taşdelen were lost in flood waters.
"As a result of the work of municipal machines, the body of one of our citizens was reached under the ground, the search for the other is ongoing," he said, noting that the search work that lasted until late at night was restarted early in the morning.
Değıroğlu stated that the rain had lost its effect and left its place in sunny air, adding that the search for the missing person and the work on the closed roads were carried out with ease.
As the search for missing women continued, it was reported that the Taşdelen village road had been opened for access.
"THE STONE WILL NOT BE STONE ON THE STONE STATE"
In the village of Taşdelen in the Yomra district of Trabzon, citizens are trying to heal the wounds of the flood and landslide disaster caused by the downpour.
Derya, one of the residents of the village of Taşdelen, stated that the rain lasted for about 3 hours nonstop and said, "It's not raining, it's like it was a disaster."
Stating that many people had evacuated their homes in case of landslide danger during the rain, Taşkara said, "We stopped collecting nuts.
Later such a disaster occurred.
The bride and mother-in-law, who disappeared in the delegation, were collecting nuts during the rain.
They were later caught in a landslide on their way home," he said.
Taşkara added that electricity was cut off in their village and that their water was not flowing.
Hasan Selim, on the other hand, stressed that he had turned 60 and had not seen such a rain until this age, adding, "If the rain had continued for another hour, there would not have been any stone left on the rocks around here."

We don't see our opponents in the bag as they are called, and the Gaziantepspor match is proof of that."
Who gets how much per month counts as a malul
From now on, I will try to contribute to your valuable Hürriyet readers in solving the problems you face in the field of working life and social security, or whatever they are curious about, and pass on my experience for you.
Our readers come across hundreds of stories in the field of social security and working life, both in writing and in the visual press.
From now on, I will present you with the most accurate, healthiest and reliable news in the daily Hurriyet and at hürriyet.com.tr.
First, I would like to address the disability file, which is very loud in public.
We will discuss these writings in chapters that will continue in the form of a series of articles.
In our article, you can find answers to all questions about disability in its outline.
You can send your questions to alipekten@hurriyet.com.tr, where you cannot find the answer and which are of particular interest to you.
I will be working hard to respond to you as soon as possible.
What is Malulen retirement?
MALULEN is the possibility of early retirement granted to them, provided that they meet the insurance requirements set forth in the SGK law so that insurance holders with SSK and Bağ-Kur who lose and fail to work at least 60 percent regardless of retirement age.
It is the case that public employees can also be retired when they have lost the power to earn in the profession in such a way that they cannot perform their duties apart from those stated above.
Who counts as a malul?
I write from Diyarbakir, my name is Mehmet Gültekin, I have 920 days of insurance and I have 1460 days of insurance along with 540 days of military debt.
Besides, I'm a kidney patient.
Connecting to the dialysis machine.
I still work in a workplace.
Can I get a month's allowance?
- Mr. Mehmet, first of all, let it be past.
It is not the first time that you have stated in your question that you have not stated when you were employed.
However, let us briefly tell you how to connect the month of disability.
First of all, the most important of the terms specified in the law is that it has been insured for 10 years and you have a total premium day of 1800 days.
In addition, you will be considered a misdemeanor when it is found that you have lost at least 60 percent of your workforce or the earning power in the profession as a result of a work accident or occupational illness by the SGK health board.
However, since you have dialysis here, you provide a 60 percent requirement that can't be linked monthly because you haven't filled the 1800 premium days count.
Of course, we don't know how many years you've worked.
If you apply to SGK on the day you complete your 10 years and 1800 days together, it will connect you monthly.
Conditions to qualify for the month of disability
Can no one retire without a ten-year, 1800-day stipulation to tie the disability month?
The 1800-day premium payment requirement must be completed.
However, there is only one exception; for those who are determined to be malnourished in need of the constant care of another, the disability allowance is tied, provided that it meets the other conditions without the requirement of 10 years, which is the insurance period.
It will be mentioned later in our article on what diseases or disorders people with permanent care will be covered in need.
The condition of those who were malformed before they started working
I'm Ahmet Güler.
They told me that even though I have all the conditions under SGK law, you can't get a malul monthly because I'm sick before I go to work for the first time.
I'm a victim.
Isn't that unfair?
How do I retire?
- Ahmet Bey, you have written that you have provided all the conditions in the Law, but it is essential that the disease, which is one of the main conditions and is the basis for the loss of work for the SSK and Bağ-kur insurers in the Law, is not present before the employment.
Since you do not meet this requirement, the disability allowance cannot be tied.
However, you can retire when you meet retirement requirements in terms of old age insurance coverage.
I have 3980 days, and I've had insurance for 16 years.
My disability was identified by the SGK, which was before I got to work.
They told me you can't retire maulen.
In that case, what am I going to do?
I won't be able to retire.
Can you guide me?
- Yes, you heard right.
Malulen, you can't retire.
However, according to you, there is a pension prescription in SGK law.
The thing is, there are two situations before and after October 2008.
If you first started working before that date, you may receive a partial old age allowance with a minimum insurance period of 15 years and a requirement of 3600 premium days if SGK determines that you have been malformed before the study.
For this reason, we recommend that you apply to a SGK Directorate nearest you to apply for a monthly binding.
- Well, if you got a job after October 2008, then you could get an old age pension, provided that you were insured for at least fifteen years, and a minimum of 3960 days of disability, old age, and death insurance premiums were reported.
Do you have to leave work when applying?
I still work as a driver in a workplace.
When I went to the hospital, I was diagnosed with cancer.
Malulen, I want to retire.
In that case, do I have to leave the workplace?
Can't I apply for the month of disability without leaving?
I don't want to be unemployed until I connect monthly.
- You heard right.
You must have left work to submit a monthly attachment petition.
However, before applying for a monthly stipend, you must be considered a misdemeanor under SGK law.
However, if you are malformed, it will connect to you monthly, along with other conditions.
There's no point in filing a monthly attachment petition before the malul is counted, you're at risk of becoming unemployed.
You just need 1800 days to do it.
When you go to SGK and file a petition to identify my disability, SGK will refer you to one of the authorized hospitals.
When you bring the health board report (that you have cancer) to SGK from here, SGK will evaluate this report on its own Health board, and there will be a reason for you to apply for monthly attachment if it decides that your cancer disease affects your work force loss by over 60 percent.
However, since you also need to fill out a 10-year insurance period for your pension to be tied up, it will also be able to connect to you monthly if you have it.
So we can briefly say that it is not rational for employee insurancers to apply without seeing the decision of the SGK health board, "you are property".
But if insurers who do not work in any job are carrying all the conditions, SGK may request that the disability status be identified and that it be linked monthly at the same time.
This can be useful for him to start a little earlier in the month if he is malul and has other conditions.
Will the bond-Kur debtor, Mallulen, retire?
I'm a bond-kur insurance agent.
I bear all the terms.
However, they said you can't retire because I owe you money.
What should I do?
- I'll read it.
Whoever told you said it was true.
You have not written down what the other terms are, but it is a legal obligation to pay your 4/b premium debt if you feel you are carrying out these terms.
But I can give you a special thio.
I would advise you to pay your debt by making banks or similar agencies the intermediary because you will be paid.
The sooner the month is tied, the more months you get and the sooner you pay in your debt.
These organizations will be easy to borrow because they cut you off from your monthly allowance.
On what status is the month of disability tied?
I worked both as a bond-Kur and as a pensioner.
Where will it connect to me monthly when I deserve the month?
- My dear reader, if you have worked in more than one status as a Bond-Board, SSK, and officer, your disability allowance is tied to the last state of insurance, which means that if you are insured from somewhere as a last SSK, you will receive monthly from the SSK, provided that you leave your job and carry other conditions.
Hospital reports valid at SGK
How to apply for disability?
Which hospitals can I get a medical report from?
- For health board reports, you only need to apply to the social security provincial directorates or social security centers you are affiliated with.
SGK will refer you to the Ministry of Health training and research hospitals, University hospitals (excluding private university and foundation hospitals), Turkish Armed Forces military hospitals.
However, in the absence of these hospitals in the province of your residence, a referral can also be made to full-fledged hospitals of the Ministry of Health.
Is it not possible to get a referral to a private hospital?
It's possible, but there are conditions.
In the old regulation, the referral of patients who are in intensive care only on condition of being state hospitals and who are at risk of life can be made to the hospital in which they are hospitalized, while the new regulation, which will come into force on 01.09.2013, can also be made to the private hospital where patients who are treated in intensive care and who are at risk of being transferred to another hospital, and the health board reports you have received from here will also be valid.
What are the requirements for shipping transactions?
It is sufficient to have a 1800-day premium in order for the transfer process to be made regarding the determination of the disability status of the insured who is requesting SEVK.
Hospital costs for malpractice determination will be paid by SGK.
Also, 10 years of insurance will not be sought, and SGK is looking at this here.
In the event of a disability pension, if the person is in need of care, they are connected monthly according to the health board report, finding only 1800 days is sufficient without looking for a 10-year insurance period that is between the insurance conditions.
Therefore, when one first comes to the detection of one's disability, the SGK only goes to the detection of disability by looking at 1800 days in case there is a needy degree of disability.
Operation Nargile
The nargile has begun auditing the police for bans that have been imposed on cafes.
As a result of weekend inspections, many businesses had to stop selling hookahs.
The police began conducting operations with the communique, which came into force at the hookah cafes in Istanbul.
The operation that carried out the hookah cafes in the Beşiktaş region stopped the sale of hookahs of unlicensed businesses.
While almost all hookah cafes are affected by inspections, operators who continue to sell hookahs will be fined in the first phase.
Businesses that continue to sell will be sealed off.
SALES STOPPED
The Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Authority's (TAPDK) "Communiqualification of the Naffillik Tobacco Products for the Field/ Fields of the Drinking Workplace on the Purposes to Be Complyed in the Processing of These Places" was published in February last year.
With the notification, the hookah cafes were given a five-month period of moving at least 200 metres away from the schools.
It is also forbidden to drink hookahs indoors.
The first operation to businesses that did not comply with the notification in question started from Beşiktaş as of the other day.
Al Faker in Bebek, Istanbul's most popular hookah venues, had to stop sales of many hookah-licensed businesses, especially Ikram Nargile Cafe in Ihlamur Kasrı and Mis Nargile Cafe in Beşiktaş bazaar.
Penalties start at 23,000
The court will issue fines starting at $23,000 if unlicensed venues continue to sell hookahs.
Places that have been fined three times will be sealed.
According to the allegations, there are currently a license for hookah cafes in about five operators in Istanbul.
Warning glued to bottles
As of 27 July, TAPDK had made it mandatory for operators to make hookah bottles 'warranted', with health warnings in cylindrical or conical form according to the form of the hookah bottle.
Warnings are being applied to begin with the mouth section of the bottles.
Blue, red, yellow and black colors can be used for printing health warnings.
There are currently warnings at several hookah cafes.
Critical warning from the police to families
The Directorate General of Police warns families about the events organized by illegal organizations under the name of "summer camp", "student camp" to gather supporters.
As a result of intelligence gathered in 17 provinces, teams of the Anti-Terrorism Branch Directorate have revealed the new plan of organizations that committed violent acts during the travel process, including DHKP-C, MLKP, TKP, TKIP and some legal structures.
Security forces, who identified that terrorist organizations organized camps for young people under the name of "summer camp" "student camp" to gather supporters, warned families not to send children to these camps.
The terror police, which determined that terrorist organizations were planning to organize 41 camps in different provinces, met with families and asked them not to send their children to these camps.
350 families give up sending their children to camp
In particular, the terror police, which determined that terrorist organizations such as DHKP-C, MLKP and TKIP were aiming to bring young people into the organization using legal extensions, warned the families they met against the activities organized by the organizations under the camp name.
Taking into account the warnings made by the police, 350 families gave up sending their children to the camps in question.
Following the police's warnings, 14 of the 41 camps that the organisations planned to organise were cancelled.
Terrorist organizations carried out 20 camps, despite declining participation.
Security forces said two camps are still in progress, while five camps are scheduled to be held in the coming days.
The Directorate General of Police also sent a warning letter to the relevant units in all provinces regarding these camps.
Young people are trapped
It was learned that 20 camps carried out by terrorist organizations were organized in İzmir, Kocaeli, Balıkesir, Çanakkale, Niğde, Eskişehir, Bursa, Bartın, Artvin, Mersin and Hatay, while the camps of Ordu, Samsun, Trabzon, Bartın, İzmir, Bolu and Adana were cancelled.
According to police reports, these camps are mostly attended by young people who have just won the university.
Illegal organizations are bringing young people into the organization by trapping them with their propaganda in the camps.
In these camps, young people who have just joined the organization are also given organizational training, increasing their commitment to the organization.
These camps, under the image of a summer camp, provide organizational training, as well as training on issues such as "how actions can be turned into violence".
Message revealed half a century later
The bottle, thrown into the Atlantic Ocean 50 years ago by a boy named Dennis Komsa, found its owner in the U.S. state of New Jersey.
The glass bottle came out of the debris around a house after Hurricane Sandy in the United States last year.
In the bottle, "The person concerned, please answer the following questions and send them to the address at the bottom.
This is a scientific study by Dennis Komsa (12)."
In the article, the person who found the bottle is asked to tell them where, when, and how he found it.
The bottle also contains an envelope and a coin to cover the postage fee.
The bottle of August 16, 1963, located about 35 kilometers from where it was dumped into the ocean on the coast of New Jersey, was recently given to its owner.
Komsa, who was 12 years old in 1963, said it was a surprise to see the bottle he threw into the ocean about half a century later, "I threw it in the water thinking someone would find it, but I never thought the bottle would return to me."
Sound frequencies make you fall in love
Süden Pamir, one of Turkey's first sound engineers, told me what could be done with the sound frequencies, I was surprised.
When you say sound technologies or sound engineering, it's pretty much everyone's idea of music-related sound systems.
But did you know that terrorism can be prevented by sound technologies, perfect murder can be committed by point-to-point sound frequency shot, you can make anyone fall in love with you, you can make a confession of a secret, or you can adapt to the rhythm of the world?
Süden Pamir received a degree in sound engineering from SAE college in the UK after graduating from the Department of Interior Architecture at Bilkent University and a master's degree in sound technologies at Middlesex University.
He also trains sound engineers at the Communication Technology Music Academy ITM, which he founded in Beyoğlu Galatasaray, and teaches music technology, sound technology, performance technologies, electronic music and advanced recording techniques.
Subliminal message to terrorism
"What exactly is sound technology?" is my first question.
"It's a technology that can be used in many areas around the world.
Our brain perceives everything by electric currents.
Sound frequency is also a type of electric current, energy.
You can use that energy to change people's perception, get them to act with whatever command you want."
One of the most important subdivisions of audio technology is the subliminal message.
Inside the music or song, the message is placed at a frequency outside the human perception limit, which cannot be defined by the upper memory but goes to the lower memory.
For example, when a terrorist is reported to attack, a music broadcast can be made to that area, according to Pamir.
If a message such as "Don't do this attack" is placed on the song that is broadcast, it will selectively recognize this message in terrorist perception.
He doesn't understand what he hears, but his lower memory perceives it, and it sounds like a voice told him not to.
In fact, he sees it as a message from God.
However, in the world and in Turkey, the use of such messages outside of community security is strictly prohibited and punishable.
Süden Pamir is a subliminal message prepared to be able to tell students about the subject at a conference he gave only once at Istanbul Technical University.
"I had the students listen to music during the conference.
I placed a sound frequency in the music, begging 'Suu'.
At the end of the presentation, I asked the students if they were thirsty.
Shockingly, they all said they were very thirsty," she recounts of her experience.
According to Pamir, there are those who illegally use subliminal messages, "Some radio stations in our country have been identified to do so, but the details are not yet known.
In Germany, there is a channel called 'Radio of the Black Voice', a frequency belonging to radical Islamists.
Subliminal method spreads messages that are over-aggressive, religiously contented, call for jihad, commanding drug use.
Both German police and Turkish police know this, but can't handle it because they're constantly changing frequencies," he said.
In addition, this type of dangerous message was used in the music world.
Especially in the songs of some heavy metal bands...
According to these claims, there was not even a terrorist in the planes that entered the towers, the attack was carried out by subliminal commands that directly addressed the pilots' subconsciousness.
Confidential table
Sound technologies can also be used in criminal cases.
In the U.S., it is particularly used in bank robberies.
For example, as soon as the police contact the robber on the phone, sound engineers are able to identify where the person is in the bank, in which room.
The echo of a sound when it hits metal, wood, plastic, wall, or any other substance is different.
It is also possible to determine the size of the room where the sound is based on the way it is echoed, or even to describe the shape of the room, how many corners it has.
Thus, it can be determined from the voice of the offender what kind of items are present, what size and shape it is in a room.
There was also a computer program used for this, where Pamir even drew drawings of an opera house from Tatarstan, "I calculated that 175 speakers could provide the perfect sound setup wherever the building was placed.
It's not an expensive technology, it's worth $45,000," he says.
Sound frequencies are also used in architecture and decoration.
Pamir has a lot of work to do about it.
For example, at a restaurant where businessmen go, where there are high-level bidding meetings, he made a setup where voices can't get out of the meeting table.
Only those on the table can hear what is spoken at the table.
Two steps away, someone else can't hear anything spoken at the table.
The general system of such apparatus is: "If you want to destroy a sound, you will collide it with another sound at the same frequency as the opposite of its own molecule structure, and you will convert it into heat by destroying the current sound energy.
No one would have been able to get on a plane without this system anyway.
Because the sound of aircraft engines is too loud to tolerate.
On the plane, these sounds are bumped against each other, destroying themselves.
With this system, you can create a peaceful environment in your home away from noise, even if your windows are open."
Were the Egyptian pyramids made with sound?
There are other interesting jobs that Pamir, one of Turkey's first sound engineers, has done.
For example, in Ayvalik, he made a setup for an outdoor disco where the sound of music could not be heard from outside.
The sound can't go beyond the border drawn, it's compared to another sound frequency and destroyed.
Even inside a room, if desired, can be made quiet after a certain line.
Pamir also made a school's gym suitable for both sports and concerts.
It's double-use.
Because when you play basketball, there's a need for echoes, but there shouldn't be echoes in concerts.
It is also possible at outdoor concerts to provide a sound quality that only music can be heard with sound technologies.
"We use frequencies that destroy sounds that are perceived as unnecessary, noise, and correct human perception, allowing music to perceive more clearly.
MTV is very advanced in this regard.
It organizes outdoor concerts and sounds like a studio recording in the sound area," he says.
Tübitak had such an experiment.
Separate the two aluminum plates by sound frequencies.
There were also scientists who claimed that the Egyptian pyramids were made with sound.
They thought the stones might have been removed and placed with sound.
I'm asking, "Isn't the sound comfortable that can be used for bad purposes?"
"I was already so scared when I read York University's work online, in case anyone else read it.
Because even by well-intentioned people, what is written can have incredibly bad consequences if tested outside of laboratory conditions."
"Prayers effective in Arabic"
Süden Pamir, who also said that noise pollution would negatively affect a person, explains why: "Because all the sounds that the ear hears are transmitted to the brain.
Although one hears the sound that one concentrates alone, but other sounds are also transmitted to the brain, which in fact leads to fatigue.
It is necessary to empty the brain, so it is good to walk barefoot in the soil, to do nature walks.
I think there should be setup in schools to absorb noise.
Thus, the student concentrates on the voice of the lone teacher and can provide concentration for longer."
Pamir says he believes that prayers will also be effective if they are read in Arabic because of the characteristics of the sound frequencies, noting that Arabic has a very rich range of frequencies, pointing out that the sounds in the words are arranged to have very positive effects when they come together.
"But I need to read the prayers out loud, and when I read the Yasin surah, I shudder."
Love recipe with frequency
"Is it also possible to make a person fall in love with sound frequencies?" comes to mind.
Pamir's description of the frequency of falling in love, or rather activating one's emotions, states: "First you need to find the dominant frequency that the person you want to fall in love with uses when talking.
You can influence it by using a frequency higher than that frequency.
For example, let's say the dominant frequency of the person is 300.
And when you're with her, you want to play music that will stimulate her feelings.
If you lower the power of the one-digit ones from the frequencies above 300 frequencies of the music you play, and make the two-digit ones dominant, that person's capacity to be affected increases.
Maybe that's how he can fall in love with the person who was in front of him at the time."
Pamir also mentioned that there are special sound systems in the world for politicians to speak more effectively, and when the bass sounds are brought to the fore, the politician is very powerful, and a stage artist can feel like a supernatural magnificent being.
"It is now being tried to make the wall sound that is believed to be blown by Michael on the day of the apocalypse in Japan, what do you think that would be like?" Pamir replied, "I think it would be a sound close to the human voice because the sound that affects man the most is the sound close to his own voice.
For example, ney is a magnificent instrument, almost as if it were made from human breath."
'Gold prices will rise'
Dan Hrushewsky, Senior Gold Analyst at Jennings Capital Inc., Canada, said that governments are working to reduce their debt through lowering the value of their currencies, so gold prices will rise from their current level, saying, "Gold will continue its role as a safe savings vehicle."
Hrushewsky, who made assessments to the AA reporter about the rise in prices, said that investors in China and India appear to be providing support for prices through low-price gold purchases, with "gold demand from China rising in relation to India, and Chinese investors play a big role in this."
Recalling that India is traditionally the largest gold buyer, Hrushewsky said, "I believe that attempts by the government to manage current accounts by restricting gold imports are no longer very popular.
People will find a way in this framework," he said.
Hrushewsky advised investors to invest in gold in the long term, saying, "Gold will continue to serve its role as a safe savings vehicle.
The rising levels of debt due to the 'lack of discipline' that many Western governments have are forgotten.
Governments are struggling to reduce their debt through lowering the value of their currencies.
Therefore, gold prices will rise from their current levels," he said.
"In the long run, gold is making improvements in its ability to reduce market risks"
Marcus Grubb, Managing Director of Investment at the World Gold Council, stated that gold is a physical entity that offers the characteristics of being simple, transparent and reliable in increasingly complex and volatile financial markets, "In the long run, gold is improving in terms of its advanced properties and ability to reduce market risks rather than falling.
Their gold portfolio of small amounts has proven to be much more durable and better at dealing with market uncertainties, showing improved yield stability."
Pointing out that the demand for gold investment has steadily risen over the past 10 years, Grubb said, "Gold represents less than 1 percent of total global investment assets.
This means that market opportunities for growth in gold investment are still very important.
In this quarter, strong capital inflows into gold and coins, which increased by 78 per cent compared to last year, are indicative of the protection of investor interest in gold."
"India must increase national gold stocks to support economic growth"
Responding to questions about India and China, the world's largest gold market, Grubb said that the drop in gold prices encouraged demand for jewelry, bullion gold and coins in the second quarter of the year, increasing the investment appetite of consumers in Asia.
Grubb recalled that demand for jewelry in China increased by 54 per cent during the period in question, and in India by 51 per cent.
Noting that Chinese consumers had an advantage by buying gold at a low price, Grubb said that if there was a rising trend, they would sell it. "In terms of jewelry demand, China would generally be quiet in the second half.
Following an unexpected drop in gold prices in April, demand rose and jewelry stores quickly ran out."
In India, Grubb noted that besides the government's restrictions on gold imports, the Central Bank of India has taken many measures to support the falling rupee and reduce its foreign exchange outputs, saying, "The demand for gold is inherently difficult for gold to execute restrictive demand practices at retail level, and therefore the demand can meet unauthorized channels.
The World Gold Council believes that, in line with India's policies, it should view gold as a strategic investment asset.
It should also increase national gold stocks to support economic growth in line with its long-term policy goals."
Global Gold Trends
According to the World Gold Council global Gold Trends report released last week, global gold demand was 856.3 tons in the second quarter of this year, and global coin and bullion gold investments were 508 tons.
In the second quarter of the year, a significant increase in the country's demand for jewelry was observed, while the demand for jewelry rose by 54 per cent in China, 51 per cent in India, 38 per cent in Turkey, and 33 per cent in the Middle East, compared to the same period the previous year.
During the period in question, consumer demand in China continued to grow strongly, with the purchase of gold up 87 percent compared to the same quarter last year, with a total of 276 tonnes this year.
In India, though the government raised taxes in an effort to prevent the rise in gold imports in the first quarter, consumer demand rose 71 percent from last year to 310 tons.
A warm Black Sea film: Servants of the Hill
The director is a doctor in Trabzon...
The actors are the lovely, al-cheeked, smiley residents of the Flowery Plain Village where the film was filmed...
Sevda Free
Filmed on a budget of only $400,000, the film has no lines, plenty of improvisation and laughter.
Under the leadership of Ismet Eredayd, who is burning with his love of cinema, the film "The Butlers of the Hill 1980" was released today and aimed at "we want everyone to see a true Black Sea story".
The premiere of the film "The Butlers of the Hill 1980", which was filmed in Akçaabat's Florentine Village and consisted of all amateur actors, also caused fun images like the film itself.
The attention of the press members to the gala, which took place at Forum Mall Cinemaximum Cinemas, was remarkable.
The team, which had a fairly crowded gala night, had a magnificent night with the horns, the Black Sea songs.
Galaya was attended primarily by Deputy Minister of Environment and Urbanism Muhammet Balta, Trabzon Mayor Dr. Orhan Fevzi Customscuoğlu, Provincial Police Director Ertan Slow, Provincial Culture and Tourism Director Ismail Kansiz, Akçaabat Kaymakami Abdul Rauf Ulusoy, Akçaabat Mayor Chiefik Turkmen and numerous guests, as well as managers of sponsor companies, national and local press representatives.
In the film written and directed by Dr. İsmet Eradın and directed by Altuğ Küçük, she shares the lead roles of Samet Karahasanoğlu, Ayşe Öztürk, Koral Koç, Selahattin Çakır, Özgür Saral, Adem Eradın and Vahide Eradın.
Today, the Butlers of the Hill, which was released with 61 copies, used Turkish subtitles for the first time in Turkey to better understand the Black Sea dialect.
The shining star on the hill!
Samet Karahasanoğlu, one of the film's leading actors, is only 18 years old.
From Samet, who lives in Trabzon, you watch the best of everything in the name of acting.
With an amateur theatre background, the actor successfully takes off from under the comedy and drama scenes in the film.
Samet Karahasanoğlu, who deserved the applause to the end, grabbed the sentence "The future will be one of the sought-after players" from the audience with his devolved performance.
Comedy and drama together!
In Trabzon's Çiçeklidüz Village, the film about the events at a time when the September 12, 1980 coup was approaching, the subject of the film is as follows:
"The film's protagonist, the father of the young Hikmet, works in Germany.
One of the biggest dreams of Hikmet, who attends school in winter and shepherds in the summer, is to complete his education and become a doctor.
However, reading and working is not much of an event.
Especially with the addition of love to Züleyha, daughter of the richest family in the village, things are getting harder.
In the face of Hikmet, who has decided to tell Züleyha about this love he has kept for years with the suggestions he received from his friends, there is a formidable obstacle, such as Züleyha's father, Sabri Agha.
Sabri Agha has other plans for her daughter.
On the other hand, 'the hill', where the surrounding villages unite and play on it, is one of their biggest obsessions, and it has waged almost a war against the villagers over this hill."
Long metraja from the short film...
Galada, the film's screenwriter and director, Dr. İsmet Eredayn, made the following statements about 1980, the Servants of the Hill, which they shot on a very small budget:
"When we started this film, our goal was to make a short film.
But the footage of the first shots received so much attention on social media that we started to get excited and shot to feature us.
When we went to Istanbul to the distributor company, they said to us, "Do you have a famous player?"
And I said, "We don't have any glory, but I have 86 Black Sea players that you won't find anywhere."
To this day, very bad sheds have been used in films and shows, and the Black Sea person has been misrepresented.
You'll see 86 original Black Sea people in the film that you're about to see.
I tried to make a Black Sea movie.
I wish others had shot it before me, so we could watch a non-cursive comedy.
If the Black Sea person hadn't been misrepresented, I wouldn't have made this film.
We put a Turkish subtitle in the Turkish film for the first time.
This will be a first.
We did this so that the Black Sea shed would be better understood.
We also put subtitles that translate the English speaking scenes in the film into Black Sea threads.
Whoever we turned the camera to when we shot this movie, it was the actor.
The Servants of the Hill is our first film.
I may have my mistakes, my shortcomings," he said.
Don't miss this warm film that brings a new breath to the Black Sea movies!
Be careful when choosing your perfume!
Your sensitivity to taking care of your personal care is high; even be careful if you are one of those who exaggerate and walk around with a perfume bottle on your hands.
The perfume you use can cause skin diseases.
We talked to Hisar Intercontinental Hospital Dermatology Specialist Dr. Funda Ataman about the Civatte Poikiloderma, which is more common in women and stems from various cosmetics, especially perfumes.
The neck lateral parts of the Civatte Poikiloderma have a skin coloration disorder seen in the neck and chest cleavage (the under-cheek area shaded by the jaw is not eclipsed), Uzm. Dr. Ataman said; ‘It often occurs in people of light color depending on staying in the sun.
It is seen in the form of brown red spots.
The skin is thinned, veiny, and the hair roots are prominent.
Pulse Dye laser treatment and sun protection is one of the treatment options.
Another is the use of creams containing retinoic acid.
These creams should be used for a long time.
Redness, which can occur during use, is not a side effect or allergy to drying, itching.
In this case, treatment should be continued intermittently.
Because it can be familial, those with Civatte Poikiloderma in their parents need to be made aware of early protection and treatment."
Major decline in cigarette consumption
In Turkey, the number of cigarettes smoked in the first 6 months of this year decreased by 10 percent compared to the same period last year, to 41 billion 779 million.
In Turkey, the number of cigarettes smoked in the first 6 months of this year decreased by 10 percent compared to the same period last year, to 41 billion 779 million 190 thousand 560.
According to information provided by the Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Authority (TAPDK), the Global Adult Tobacco Research (KYTA) conducted by the Turkish Statistical Agency in order to obtain information on the status of adults using tobacco products in Turkey and to create a data source for decision makers and researchers in this regard has been completed.
According to the research results, 31.2% (16 million people) of individuals aged 15 and above across Turkey used tobacco products every day or occasionally in 2008, while in 2012 the rate dropped to 27.1% (14.8 million people), and the frequency of tobacco use decreased by 13.4 percent.
41.5% of men and 13.1 percent of women use tobacco
The proportion of people using tobacco products also fell from 47.9 per cent in men to 41.5 per cent in women to 13.1 per cent in women.
According to the study, 6 out of 10 people who use tobacco products are considering quitting smoking.
The proportion of those who were considering quitting tobacco within a month was 12.9 percent, and those who were planning to quit within 12 months were 35.4 percent.
In the evaluation section of the study, the following views were given:
"The clear result from the consumption of tobacco products points to the effective implementation of tobacco control laws and the National Tobacco Control Program and Action Plan in Turkey.
In this way, the number of people consuming tobacco products decreased from 2008 to 2012 by 2 million 200 thousand people, the frequency of use declined by 4.1 percent. The most significant reduction in cigarette use was in the price-sensitive sectors such as young people and under-educated people.
According to the World Health Organization's 2013 Global Tobacco Epidemic Report, Turkey was the first and only country to meet all criteria by achieving high levels of success in terms of tobacco control.
The report asked other countries to follow and imitate Turkey."
The ban on smoking in enclosed areas continues to have its effect.
The amount of cigarettes smoked during the first 6 months of this year decreased by 10 percent compared to the same period last year, down 41 billion 779 million 190 thousand 560.
This figure was at 46 billion 325 million 44 thousand 100 units during the same period of 2012.
The walls will now be touchscreen!
Ubi Interactive has released a very interesting product that uses Microsoft's 'Kinect' technology.
Microsoft had included 11 new companies into the Kinect Accelerator program last year to support projects that would use Kinect on Windows.
The software giant was providing money, space, hardware support to these companies.
One of the most interesting software demos, which came out thanks to Kinect Accelerator, was shown by Ubi Interactive.
In the demo, an ordinary projector combines with Kinect for Windows, and the projection on the wall is transformed into a giant touchscreen.
According to a new post on the Kinect for Windows website, there are several companies that are testing this technology.
The software tested by over 50 institutions within the private beta process is now available for sale by Ubi.
Prices are available on Ubi's website.
For a 45-inch touchscreen, you need to take out $149.
A 100-inch touchscreen that can detect touch from 20 points will cost you $1,499.
Ubi's software and Kinect for Windows are included in the prices but you need to purchase the projector separately.
Another innovation for Android!
With this patent, Google will make the 'file-and-send' process even easier.
Google, which is an open winner with Android among mobile operating systems, has patented a new interface technology that will benefit those who frequently share files with friends.
The function for sharing content over wireless technologies such as NFC and Bluetooth is not really very different from Android Beam and Apple Airdrop examples.
The latest innovation that carries the Google signature is that it allows to spread this function to nearby user groups instead of one-time shares, and it offers users the ease of drag-and-drop.
It seems certain that the new feature will be included in future Android versions...
Here is Turkey's first domestic smartphone
Turkcell also got into the smartphone business.
The factory of smartphones to be produced jointly with China will be in Turkey.
Its name is T40.
Turkcell introduced Turkey's first domestic smartphone.
The TCELL design will release the smartphone T40, which is made in Turkey and will also be produced in Turkey with China, at the end of September.
Turkcell General Manager Süreyya Ciliv said they plan to launch the smartphone T40, developed in collaboration with US chip maker Qualcomm and introduced as a Gebze project in February, in all nine countries where Turkcell operates.
Ciliv, who made a presentation at the launch of the T40, said that they also had talks with Turkish manufacturers, saying "Some of the T40 will be produced in China; in 2013 it will be produced in Turkey before the end of the year."
WILL BE THE FALL OF THE FALL
Ciliv said they would release the phone at an affordable price, saying they would announce the final price near the sale.
With the T40, Ciliv said they aim to increase the use of data and increase their revenue by offering a smartphone to the market at a more accessible price than benefiting from device sales.
Ciliv said that 1 million of the T-series phones Turkcell has sold since 2010, bringing the foreign trade deficit down to 500 million liras.
THE PICTURE WILL BE COMPLETED CLOSE TO THE MARKETING
Turkcell General Manager Süreyya Ciliv said that the T40 will have features such as noise blocking, high-definition sound, surround sound, and adjustable user interface.
Ciliv said the T40's price would be announced before the phone went on the market, the price of the phone would be affordable.
Every year, five billion dollars go outside.
Tayfun Acarer, president of the Information Technology and Communication Agency (BTK), said they supported local production, "57 percent of the phones that come to Turkey are smartphones.
Due to the increase in this rate, the average price of phones sold came to $300.
We import $5 billion in phones every year from 15 million units, my concern is that this will increase."
The T40, which will run on the Android operating system platform, will feature a Qualcomm dual-core processor and 1 GB of RAM.
They're all imam oratories!
Records of students studying in normal secondary school were renewed as imam orator secondary school students
Following the 4+4+4 regulation in education, MEB had transformed all primary schools in Turkey last year into primary, middle school and imam orator secondary schools.
After a one-year period of education, it was revealed that the ministry, which had turned several schools into imam oratories in line with the re-emergenced "need", had signed a new scandal during the conversion proceedings.
The "transformation" scandal in Turkey, which may interest the current students of all schools that have been converted into imam orator secondary schools this year, was brought up during the conversion and registration renewal process at Sugar Middle School in Meram district of Konya.
1 year of normal secondary school
The Sugar Elementary School was converted to secondary school at the beginning of last year, following the regulation of 4+4+4.
At the school, elementary school 3rd and 4th graders and secondary school 6th, 7th and 8th graders were studying together, which would be a gradual transition to another school by system.
The school, which served as a regular secondary school for one year, was transformed into an imam orator secondary school with the end of the 2012-2013 school year.
The school, which was translated into Imam oratory, accepted 5th graders as "imam orator students" for the first time this year.
However, the records of the students who were attending 5th grade normal secondary school last year and who would move to 6th grade this year were automatically renewed as imam orator secondary school students in electronic form.
'To another school that doesn't want it'
Parents who learned of the situation came to school and complained about the situation.
The school administration, however, told parents, "Parents who do not want their children to continue in the imam orator, may have their registration taken to another secondary school."
The statement from Konya Provincial Directorate of National Education included interesting statements.
"By taking into account the student and school numbers and preferences, we have transformed some schools again with the become of Konya Governorate. Within this scope, 15-20 schools in Konya have also been converted into imam oratories.
Schools enter the ministry's e-school system with school codes.
However, when the school is translated into imam orator, the code of the old school is deleted from the system.
By opening the new school code, students need to be enrolled in the system.
Those schools also used the new institution code to transfer students to imam orator secondary school so that both the students and teachers of the changing school would not be victims.

Family Ministry's request denied
ŞEYMA ULUSOY / VATAN ISTIHBARAT
In the case of Abbas Şahin, who killed his wife, 24-year-old Pinar Şahin, who filed for divorce, the prosecutor rejected the request of the Ministry of Family, who requested intervention in the case, on the grounds that there was no violent case.
Abbas Şahin, the prisoner in the first trial of the case seen in the 5th High Criminal Court of Bakirköy, Ayşe Şahin, mother of the murdered Pınar Şahin, and her older sister Gift İkiz attended.
Defendant Abbas Şahin presented a 4-page defense to the court.
In Şahin's defense, "My wife asked me for help to make a fresh start.
He asked me to rent a house when we met, but I didn't know where the house was.
I lost control and removed the gun I had with me.
In the meantime, my wife hugged the wheel.
The gun exploded with the car turning sideways.
My wife fell on my arm.
Then I took her to the clinic.
I regret it."
If we agree, he'll take on every case.
Anne Ayşe İkiz said, "My daughter was 14 years old when she married.
During her marriage, she repeatedly abused my daughter," while the sister, Gift Twin, said that the accused had kidnapped her brother twice.
Following the complaint of the mother and sister, a lawyer for the Ministry of Women and Social Policies requested to join the case.
Court prosecutor Tariq Dursun Bendez, who explained his opinion on the request, said that "in the event that the request for a crime is made in accordance with Article 20 of the Law of 6284, the Ministry may participate in any administrative, criminal, legal and non-controversial case and the idea of a murder is not a case of violence, but a case of equality and not a case of murder if deemed necessary."
The court complied with the prosecutor's request.
It was accepted to this day.
The Ministry of Family and Social Policies had requested intervention in the case filed after the death of Melek Karaaslan, who was constantly violent by his wife and her family in Ağrı.
The court had justified this request from the ministry.
The teacher, Esin Güneş, who turned out to be pushed off the cliff by his wife, is also involved in the case of the Ministry of Family and Social Policies.
- In October of last year in İzmir, Fatma Şahin, Minister of Family and Social Policies, wanted to be involved in the case through Legal Counsel Birsel Kurt, who was prosecuted for the alleged stabbing of his wife to whom he was about to divorce, demanding a aggravated life sentence.
The court accepted this request.
In Van, a 32-year-old Kerem Chakran, who was arrested for murder by car after stabbing 6-month-old Action Pesen, who was six months pregnant with no marriage, is also involved in the Ministry of Family and Social Policies.
