Welsh Councillors fear to "look like a puppet"
The proposal to change their title to Member of the Welsh Parliament [MWP] has caused concern among some members of parliament.
This concern arose from the plan to change the name of the legislature to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are concerned that the name may be ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that those in the party were concerned that the name was "rhyming with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: "twp" in Welsh means crazy, and "pwp" means poop.
A member of the Plaid Party proposed an alternative, stating that those in the party were generally "unpleasant".
One of the Gal Conservative Party Members said that those at his party were "open-minded" about the name change, while the MWP told Muppet (the puppet) that he had a little pun.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced like the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
"The final decision on defining what to say to members of parliament will, of course, belong to the members themselves," the House Commission, which is now drafting legislation that will bring name changes, said.
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh legislature the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission released the results of public opinion on proposals that received great support for making the name of the legislature the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the titles of the members of parliament, the Commission was in favour of Welsh Parliament Members [WMP], while the MWP title was the most supported option in public opinion reception.
Members of parliament are clearly proposing different options, but consensus could be a headache for Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over the bill on the amendments in the coming weeks.
The law on innovations will include some amendments to the way parliament works, which include rules such as members being barred from parliament and the order of the committee system.
Members will make their final decisions on which name to take when they discuss the law.
Macedonians to hold referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia" on Sunday.
This popular vote was set up to end a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, where a region called Macedonia is located.
Athens has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the EU and NATO, while insisting that its long-standing northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote on the name change, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is a price to pay for membership in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Filled with Silence Like Churches in the Harlem Problem
"The older people I talk to say there was a bar and a church in every corner in their time," Adams said.
"There are no longer either."
Adams said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"Now people are socializing in different ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood halls where people go regularly."
As for the churches, Adams worries that the money made by selling the goods will not be enough for as long as the leaders expect, and that they will "come back to where they started sooner or later".
He added that the kind of apartments where people would not help the neighborhood's remaining places of worship would replace the churches.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments from these apartments will be white, so it will speed up the closing of all churches together, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches," he said.
Both churches were built in Harlem 1870 by the Metropolitan Community, and a decade later by white congregations before becoming the black metropolis of St. Martin's.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A black congregation who worshiped nearby took ownership of the building.
Reverend John Howard Johnson had led a boycott against stores on 125th Street, a main street used for shopping in Harlem, which resisted hiring and promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's followers ordered the bell set because they planned to rebuild the building.
Father Johnson's son and his successor in St. Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly described the bell set as "the bells of poor people".
In July, the expert who sounded the bells gave the team another name: "a cultural treasure" and "a unique historical tool."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also stated that this team was the first bell to be played by a black musician in the world, and that musician was Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger bell team at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been going on in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story, some of which are non-community leaders in the church, and some of the architects and contractors found by the diocese.
The board of directors, the church's executive force of non-cleric leaders, sent a message to the diocese in July, concerned that the board would "put costs on them", though it had no part in retaining architects and contractors sent by bishops.
Some of the congregation complained that there was no transparency in the church.
In California, shark injures 13-year-old boy who dives to catch lobster
Officials say a shark injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving in California on Saturday to catch lobsters on the day the lobster season opened.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. off Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that half an hour after he started diving with his friends on Saturday morning, he heard the boy screaming and asking for help, and he went on a boat with a group to get the boy out of the water.
Hammel initially thought the boy was shouting at the excitement of finding lobster, but later realized that he was shouting, "'He bit me! He bit me!'"
He said.
When Hammel went to the boy, he told him what he saw: "The whole bone was open."
"I told everyone to get out of the water, 'There's sharks in the water!'" he added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was determined to be critical.
The species of attacking shark is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles informed the press that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that he suffered traumatic injuries to the victim's upper body.
Authorities closed the entrance to the beaches in the area from the Ponto beach in Casablad to the Swami beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours on research and security grounds.
Giles said there were about 135 shark species in the area, but most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's incorporates Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles and expert staff.
As part of a strong entry into the UK's treble cosmetics market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods fall, larger cosmetic aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will move to more stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics comes from supermarkets looking for ways to fill shelves that were previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens, and household items.
Sainsbury's said the number of cosmetic products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, would reach 3,000 for the first time.
Brands from L'Oreal to Maybelline and Burt's Bees, such as those in brand areas found in stores like Boots, will also find more locations.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique makeup series, in order to make most of its products more and more vegan products that are increasingly in demand by young customers.
Also, Fragrance Shop, a perfume salesman, will be located in two Sainsbury's stores, one opening in Croydon, South London last week, and the other in Selly Oak, Birmingham this year.
With the trend towards online shopping and day-to-day food shopping from small local stores, supermarkets are forced to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's General Manager, said that the supermarket chain will increasingly resemble department stores to compete with Aldi and Lidl discounted sales stores that offer more non-food services.
Since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, he has put Argos booths in hundreds of stores and included some Habitat stands, which he says supports market sales and increases profits.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate its cosmetic and pharmaceutical department had failed.
Sainsbury's tried to open a joint store with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after their dispute over sharing the revenues of pharmacies in their supermarkets.
After Sainsbury's sold 281 stores of pharmacy businesses to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, three years ago for 125 million pounds, the new strategy emerged.
Lloyds is said to play a role in the plan by adding luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Commercial Director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetic aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who were ready to give advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet every need, and our attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are a cosmetic salesman pushing the old shopping style."
Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a deal worth .11 million "infuriated" Peter Jones
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, left the show "angryly" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11-million-pound deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The two's work was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning announced on Instagram that the 37-year-old host of the program had left.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons' Den's star Peter Jones by leaving his lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on his new lucrative contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones "was outraged" when television's golden girl, Marlow, confessed on Tuesday at a tense meeting at the heart of his business empire in Buckinghamshire, that their new deal of 1.5 million pounds meant she no longer had enough time to devote to the homewear and accessories brands, Truly.
The firm was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to have doubled Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
Willoughby, 37, revealed on Instagram that he had quit Truly, while Jones left on his jet to go to one of his vacation homes outside the UK.
One source said: "Truly was first among Holly's priorities by a clear margin.
He would have a long-term future to support him for the next two decades.
Holly's decision to withdraw completely shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was close to launch.
There's a warehouse at Marlow HQ full of merchandise ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of one of the UK's top box office stars, this Morning program host, could cost the firm millions of pounds due to serious investments in a variety of products, from pillows to candles, clothing to homewear, and the potential for its release to be delayed.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Three child mothers Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, Jones, 52, and joined as president in March.
Couples vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will become M&S' brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin, host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
"We're not commenting on his business issues," a source close to Jones said last night.
"We fell in love when we said a tough speech"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media, as some made comments that he would find "unpresidential" and were so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump impersonated the "newsman" and responded by saying:
"I didn't give up anything."
He stated that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described the call for his first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations for nuclear disarmament have been hampered.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "counter-response" from the United States to its previous disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the United States continues its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his rally speech.
"Our relationship with North Korea is great," he said.
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now."
He said that improving their relationship with Kim brought positive results, such as finishing rocket tests, releasing hostages, and returning the rest of the American soldiers home.
He also advocated his unusual approach to talking to Kim about their relationship.
Trump pointed to the crowd in front of him, saying, "It's very easy to act in a way that suits the president, but it would be 200 people standing here rather than 10,000 people trying to get into this narrow space."
Tsunami and Earthquake Hit Candidate in Indonesia, Hundreds Killed
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population is displaced, no national disaster reports have been reported, a prerequisite for facilitating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they made it very clear that they did not seek international assistance, so the situation is difficult," Sumbung said.
Save the Children has teamed up to go to Palu, but it is not yet clear if the foreign team will be able to work on the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officers were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid work.
Given that Indonesia has consistently been hit by earthquakes, the country is unfortunately not prepared enough for nature's wrath.
While tsunami shelters are being built in Aceh, there are no such works on other shores.
Although a warning has been issued in Palu, the lack of tsunami warning sirens is likely to have caused the loss of life.
Even in the best case, it is difficult to travel between many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area affected by the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made developing Indonesia's frayed infrastructure the most important part of his campaign and has spent a lot of money on highways and railways.
But funding the shortcomings has put Joko in a difficult position because there will be re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from sectarian conflicts in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority embraces a more conservative faith.
The clashes of Christian and Muslim gangs using knives, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons on the street led to the deaths of over 1,000 people and tens of thousands of people from their homes.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a draw against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved his team from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, with a goal in the 89th minute.
Sturridge passed Xherdan Shaqiri when he was 30 yards from Chelsea's goal when his team was 1-0 behind.
After lightly taking the ball to his left, he shot it into the far pole.
The shot flew over the penalty area as it headed to the upper right side of the fort.
The ball finally hit the bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga, entering the nets.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com, "I was just trying to pick up the ball and find a position, and players like Shaq always go as far as they can, so I tried to save as much time as I could."
"I saw Kante coming and I touched him once, and I shot him without thinking too much."
Chelsea, who scored with Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute, finished 1-0 in the first half.
The Blues' forward gave Mateo Kovacic a heel pass in the game before running from midfield to Liverpool halffield.
Kovacic made a quick ver run in the midfield.
Then he gave a nice break pass, bringing Hazard to the penalty point.
Hazard crossed the line of defense and threw the ball into the back nets, shooting a shot past Liverpool player Alisson Becker with his left foot.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the Champions League group match at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in London in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday.
Death toll in tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
Indonesia's emergency response agency said early Sunday that the death toll in the tsunami had risen to 832 with the country's earthquake.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's representative, said at a press conference that many people were reported under building debris in the earthquake, which hit the country at 7.5 on Friday, causing waves to form at 20 feet high.
With a population of over 380,000, the city of Palu was flooded with rubble of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was opened this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of the 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 p.m. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police forces wanted people in the area to appear who had heard or seen anything about the incident.
Investigator Brian O'Hagan, who was investigating the murder, said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I am calling for anyone near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us who has seen or heard anything suspicious.
I also call for them to contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation, especially those who may have caught something with taxi drivers, vehicle road cameras."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a native of Birkenhead, the woman was found inside a private property.
This afternoon, some friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene this morning asking questions about the victim's whereabouts.
Investigations continue, as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to break into his apartment, but police said no one was allowed inside or outside the building.
When he found out what was going on, the driver was speechless.
Those who lived at home were now told that it would take hours for them to be allowed back into their homes.
One police officer was heard telling another man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
An elderly woman appeared at the scene.
She kept repeating, "What's going on is so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were cordoned, while another was just outside the cordon.
Several police officers stood inside the cordon and watched over the apartment buildings.
Anyone with information is asked to write in private to @MerPolCC, or call 101, or contact 0800 555 111, the private and secret crime stop line, without naming it, quoting 247 of the September 30 journal.
The Cromwell statue in front of the assembly was the final target monument in the debate on "rewriting history"
The expulsion of the statue would be a divine justice for Cromwell's fanatical puritanical followers, destroying many cultural, religious works in England.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell figure in front of Westminster Palace would be the target within the current debate over the removal of the statues.
Neither Cromwell did the icon-breaking of the British civil wars, nor did these wars take place at his behest.
Perhaps a false Cromwell would have been sacrificed from the previous century instead of his ancestor, Thomas.
The magnificent Cromwell representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th-century view, and Cromwell is a figure that many people still consider worthy of being celebrated, part of the writing of history.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more than he is today in the 19th century, as a defender of parliament against outside pressures, of monarchy in his case.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate statement is an ongoing historical topic of debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation following this event, and that Cromwell is a well-known person who represents a side in this dispute.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killer Pig Beats Up Who Killed Chinese Farmer
According to a local media report, a farmer was attacked by a pig and died in a bazaar in southwest China.
According to the South China Morning Post on Sunday, the man identified only by his surname, "Yuan", was found in a blood-covered artery near the pigs' barn in Liupanshui, Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai province, China, a pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pigpen.
The man reportedly left his cousin and neighbouring state of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and noticed that the door of a nearby pig-crumb was open.
His cousin said there was a large male pig in the pigpen with a mouth full of blood.
The coroner's report confirmed that a giant pig weighing 550 pounds battered the farmer to death.
According to the Guiyang Main News, his cousin, whose surname was called "Wu", said: "My cousin's legs were covered in blood, crushed."
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's pig.
While police were gathering evidence at the scene, one of the market managers told Main News that he was being kept closed to prevent the pig from attacking someone.
Yuan's family and the authorities in the market are said to be negotiating compensation for Yuan's death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked her and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650 pound pig trapped a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
A farmer from Oregon was defeated by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood could be a "trigger".
Farmer: "Pigs are just joking.
They're curious pincers... they don't want to hurt you.
You just need to give them the necessary amount of respect," he said.
What remains of the Rosa hurricane brings widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
According to weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring torrential rains along the north of Mexico and the northwest of the United States.
As of 5:00 p.m., Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane, with a wind speed of 85 miles per hour, located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico on Sunday, according to the eastern time.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure strip is formed along the Pacific Ocean and begins to move eastward to the west coast of the United States, as Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, pushing deep tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will rain in parts of Mexico, reaching 10 inches in size.
Then, tropical moisture, which will be affected by the upcoming low pressure strip, will generate extensive rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Regionally, rainfall from 1 to 4 inches will also likely lead to landslides in the desert, in addition to sudden flooding, debris flows.
Deep tropical moisture will bring rainfall rates closer to an hourly magnitude of 2 to 3 inches in certain areas, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In southwestern areas, especially much of Arizona, there is expected to be enough rainfall to reach a size of 2 to 4 inches.
Sudden flooding is possible under conditions that quickly worsen due to the messy nature of tropical rainfall.
In tropical rainfall warning, it is extremely objectionable to risk going to the desert on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, while borons can bring dust that is fluttered by heavy winds locally.
The upcoming low pressure strip will leave some heavy rainfall locally on the Southern California coastline.
With small-scale debris flows, it is possible to generate rainfall over half an inch in total, which can lead to slicking of roads.
This will be the region's first rain in the rainy season.
Some tropical downpours, scattered before the rains spread over larger areas on Mondays and Tuesdays, will begin to approach Arizona early Monday, towards the end of Sunday.
Heavy rain will spread across the Four Corners region on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, a number of temperature oscillations can be seen throughout the United States due to the fact that tropical belts remain quite warm as the poles cool.
Sometimes this can lead to sudden temperature changes over small distances.
There is a terrific example of sudden temperature changes that occurred throughout the mid-US on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and there is the same difference between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the late summer temperature will rise again and try to spread.
In many parts of the central and eastern United States, with October, the 80 degree latitude belt is expected to feel a temperature starting from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City can see 80 fahrenheit on Tuesday, about 10 degrees higher than normal.
Our long-term climate forecast gives us a high probability for temperatures above average in the first half of October for the east of the United States.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial
On Thursday, with his stirring testimony, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate of the Supreme Court, and allegedly the woman who accused him of sexual harassment in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, from six different television networks.
Meanwhile, his stay away from politics continued the broadcasters' regular schedule of Friday with a last-minute return: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford told the U.S. Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh was 100% sure he was trying to get his clothes off while he was drunk at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure that there was no what was said in his excited statement.
According to Nielsen's transfer, it was possible for more than 20.4 million people to watch the trial on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience based on MSNBC with CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel.
The audience of other networks showing the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not immediately reached.
Moreover, Nielsen often has trouble calculating the number of people watching things in the office.
In other words, this number of spectators was similar in size to a qualifying match in American football or the audience of the Academy Awards.
The Fox News Channel, which the idea-servers heavily supported Kavanaugh's appointment, said Nielsen, outperformed all networks with an average audience of 5.69 million during the day-long trial.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS watched 3.1 million, NBC watched 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million, CNN watched 2.52 million.
After the trial, high attention continued.
In Friday's drama, Flake was the central swimmer.
After the moderate Republican office announced that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Kavanaugh caught CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, where he was booed by protesters as they tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee's hearing.
Standing in front of him for a few minutes while he was violently rebuked, he was broadcast live on CNN.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think he told the country the truth?
In its form, Kavanaugh was told, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had made a statement before the elevator closed, that he had more to say at the committee's hearing.
The cable networks and broadcast networks were all live hours later, when the Justice Committee directed Kavanaugh's appointment to vote for the entire Senate.
Flake, however, said he would only do what he was told if the FBI investigated the crimes against the island for a week, the time the minority Democrats demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then a few senators.
Flake's election had an effect because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the number of votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politicizing" over Brexit issue
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of damaging Britain's future by "making political material," national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is attending the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, just next to May's interview on the front page of the paper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced May's move against the so-called "dama game" for Brexit, saying that May's proposal, which was to collect Britain's and the EU's tax on each other, was "totally ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson in LSU (Louisiana State University) player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims, who played for LSU, which ended in death.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison on second-degree murder charges.
Authorities have released video footage of Simpson's confrontation with Sims, where police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS-affiliated WAFB reported that the police who took the glasses from the scene had a DNA sample of Simpson on the glasses.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he confessed to fatally shooting Wayde.
The lawyer said the offender's penance was set at $350,000.
The Office of the East Baton Rouge Parish Interrogation Judge issued a preliminary statement on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot to the head.
The department has handed over the rights of the Louisiana State Police fugitive capture arm, the state police murder lab, the Southern University, the people of the area, who helped with the investigation that ended with the arrest.
LSU sports executive Joe Alleva thanked the district law enforcement for their "enthusiasm in the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
His father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU, grew up in Baton Rouge, a 6-foot 6-inch-long forward.
Last season he averaged 2.6 rebounds with 5.6 points per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disrupted," and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano sprays ash on Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity began in its crater. 183 times gas and ash emission was recorded in 24 hours.
The center was followed by numerous shakes and rumblings.
Images on social media showed ash sheets covering the windshields of cars in thin layers in locations adjacent to the city, such as Mexico City's Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have also detected an increase in activity in the volcano, 45 miles south of the capital, since the earthquake, which shook central Mexico with a magnitude of 7.1 in September 2017.
Known as "Don Goyo", the volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with separatist Catalans ahead of anniversary of independence game
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after arrests followed by rioting by pro-independence protesters, as well as thousands of dissidents to celebrate the first anniversary of the polarizing game for the separation of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the riot squad, who rained eggs and threw powder paints at the police, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Fighting broke out at the end of the day as police used the baton to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups read songs against unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain" in the form of "No forgetting, no amnesty".
Fourteen people were treated as a result of minor injuries in the protests, local media reported.
Tension remained high in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum, declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters chose to remain independent by an overwhelming majority, but the turnout remained low as those opposed to secession boycotted voting.
According to Catalan officials, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop people from going to polling points by violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups set up tents on Friday to block demonstrations of support for the national police for one night.
The show started but had to follow a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful of the possibility of Catalunya gaining independence.
Narcis: "We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying out of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Last December, they were able to achieve a small but crucial win, but Catalan separatist parties had a hard time maintaining momentum this year, as many of their best leaders were either in forced exile or awaiting trial for their role in organising the declaration of independence that followed by a referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest against police support on her phone, said the debate was portrayed by politicians on both sides.
Joan Puig: "The situation has become more and more tense," she said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial prison from late last year, announced that he will compete in the European Parliament elections next year.
"To run for elections in Europe is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values, the pressure we see from the Spanish government," Oriol said.
Londonderry: Some men arrested after car tossing into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 to 39 were arrested after a car was repeatedly tossed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday, at Ballynagard Crescent, about 7:30 p.m., at the British summer time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the doors and the building.
At some point, the car could have been shot with a crossbow.
With Menga's shot, Livingston beat the Rangers 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal brings the win to Livingston
Growing up in the upper division, Livingston shocked Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard a taste of his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
The difference was Dolly Menga's shot, while Gary Holt's team moved to second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team still hasn't won a away win at the Premiership this season, and will face the leader Hearts, who is eight points behind next Sunday.
Prior to this match, Rangers will host Rapid Wien in a Europa League game on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, led the league's undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt has not met defeat since taking office from Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston has missed positions in the face of a blunt guest team
Holt's team gave the Rangers all kinds of trouble with his open play, and he could have been ahead long before he scored the goal.
Scott Robinson made the attack, but his effort was not enough for the goal, and then Alan Lithgow's ball, which skidded to meet Craig Halkett's head-kick, went out differently.
The host team allowed Rangers to play in the lead, knowing that they would have a hard time with the ball standing on the guest team.
This is how the important goal of the game came to be.
The Rangers gave the opposing team a free kick, and in Livingston's organization, with Declan Gallagher, Robinson threw the ball to Menga, while Menga touched the ball through the middle of the penalty area.
Until that stage, Rangers were the side that had more of the ball, but it was difficult to get past the homeowner's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This game model continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a rescue.
Scott Pittman was blocked by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet, while Lithgow threw the ball out in another Livingston standing ball.
While all of the middles that fell on the Livingston penalty area were suspended, two penalty claims, Halkett's intervention in reserve player Glenn Middleton, and a hand-play, were rejected by the referee.
"Excellent" Match by Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont, Tony Macaroni Arena
Outstanding performance and result for Livingston.
Each player of the team was excellent and continued to exceed expectations as a result of their exit.
The game style and squad have not changed much since its return to the top of the league, but Holt, who has fired the team since its arrival, deserves the biggest of the praise.
Holt had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga harassed Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the match.
Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far behind their good performance under Gerrard from time to time.
They failed in the last ball, where they were only able to pass the opponent's defense once, and this could be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who found themselves in the midfield of the league.
Welcome to Erdoğan both good and bad in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at a breakfast in Berlin, there were smiling faces and a blue sky.
The meeting took place on the last day of President Erdoğan's controversial visit to Germany in an effort to restore relations between NATO allies.
On issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's accession to the EU, the two countries had their differences.
Erdoğan then went to Cologne to open a new massive mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police justified security to prevent the 25,000-strong exuberant crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but several supporters in the immediate vicinity were present to see the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, also voiced their voices, denouncing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
Counter-protests show how a visitor, considered a hero by some Turks living in Germany, led to a separation, some viewed as a dictator.
Car crash in Deptford: cyclist killed in car crash
A bicycle driver was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The car driver stopped and paramedics intervened, but the person died at the scene.
Saturday's accident occurred a few months after another cyclist crashed and escaped on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene.
Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify the man and keep his family informed.
The road was closed, bus routes were changed, and drivers were advised to stay out of the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured in chaos
The prison administration said six prison guards were injured in a disturbance in a high-security men's prison.
The confusion came and continues on Sunday at His Majesty's Prison (Her Majesty's Prison [HMP]) in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. British Summer Time in Long Lartin.
Expert "Tornado" officials were brought in to deal with the confusion, where eight prisoners were involved and one wing was stopped.
Officials with minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Prisoners with special training were assigned to solve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
The injuries of six staff members were treated.
We cannot tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are determined that those responsible will be sent to the police and remain behind bars longer."
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison warden had been treated at the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
In October of last year, riot suppression officers were called to the prison to resolve a serious confusion in which officers were attacked with pool balls.
Flooding Danger in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City Due to Hurricane Rosa (May Be Useful for Dry Areas)
It's rare to see Arizona hit by a tropical depression, but that's exactly what caused the energy from Hurricane Rosa earlier this week to cross the Southwest Desert and pose flooding risks.
The National Weather Forecasting Agency issued flood warnings on Mondays and Tuesdays for the area covering Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, all the way to South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah with West Arizona.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain at the end of Monday, adopting a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday.
In a tweet, the National Weather Forecasting Agency in Phoenix said: "Since 1950, only ten tropical hurricanes, tropical storms or depressions have formed around 200 miles around Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent National Hurricane Center models estimate that there will be 2 to 4 inches of rainfall along the Arizona Mogollon Edge, with amounts of up to 6 inches.
Other parts of the Southwest Desert, including the Middle Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, can receive 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, while in secluded areas this volume can reach 4 inches.
The rains brought by Rosa may be a blessing in areas that are not at risk of flooding, as drought dominates the area.
Although the flood is a serious problem, some of these rainfalls may be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
"According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing an extreme drought problem, at least the second highest category," Weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path is through Mexico's Baja California peninsula to make contact with land for the first time.
It is located 385 miles south of Rosa, Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning and is heading north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is running low in the Pacific as it encounters colder waters.
Therefore, it is expected to reach Mexican territory in the tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Heavy rains, which can be seen in some parts of Mexico, can pose a significant flood risk.
"A total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected between Baja California and Northwest Sonora, it is also possible to reach 10 inches," Weather.com reported.
Rosa will then follow northern Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning, then entering Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is that it causes very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the Southeast Desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flooding, mud currents in deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three young boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed to death in Somerset.
The young boy was found injured in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area on Saturday around 4:00 a.m. British Summer Time.
He was hospitalized and his condition "stable."
According to Avon and Somerset Police, four men, one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and the other 20-year-old, were arrested in the Redstock area in the middle of the night.
Officials have appealed to the testimony of anyone who may have an image of the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh is "victim of humiliation and anger" of Democratic Party
Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, "A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the brutal and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party."
During Kavanaugh's candidacy process, Trump said, the Democratic Party was "victim of lowness and anger".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and excitedly denying Christine Blasey Ford's claim that she sexually harassed her when they were both young years ago.
Ford also testified at a hearing on his own claim.
The president told his crowd supporters in West Virginia on Saturday: "The American people saw the light, quality and courage of Kavanaug that day.
A vote that endorses Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that will validate one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with valuable achievements in public service."
The president addressed Kavanaugh's candidacy indirectly, speaking about the importance of the Republican turnout to the midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats had undertaken the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
According to one of the senior Republican Party executive aides to CNN, the first major vote on procedure for Kavanaugh's candidacy in the Senate is expected to take place on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, balance sheet rising
At least 384 people were killed as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, officials said, and a large number of people were caught in giant waves hitting the beaches.
On Friday, as it was dark in the city of Palu, when waves reached six metres (18 feet) high hit the shore, hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach, destroying everything that stood in its way as the waves drove a large number of people to their deaths.
There was a tsunami following a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster harm reduction agency BNPB, said at a briefing in Jakarta, "When the tsunami threat hit yesterday, people were continuing their activities on the beach, they didn't run away immediately, and they were victims of the incident."
"The tsunami wasn't the only event; it dragged cars, trees, houses with it, and hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 mph) before reaching the coastline.
He said some people climbed trees and survived to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed a large number of buildings and shops devastated, bridges bent and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued in the coastal city on Saturday.
In the area of 2.4 million people, successive earthquakes were felt.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said the energy generated by the massive tremor on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It was said that the geography of the city, located at the end of a narrow and long bay, may have magnified the tsunami size.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide-scale" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He added that some of the bodies belonging to the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, while 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of injuries and damage to the area along the coast, Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, could be greater, 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu.
Nugroho said that communication in Donggala was "completely paralysed and no information was available".
The Red Cross said in a statement that "more than 300,000 people live there," adding that its staff and volunteers are reaching the affected areas.
"Even in this state, it's a tragedy, but the situation can get much worse," it was said.
The institution received widespread criticism on Saturday for failing to report that the tsunami had struck Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived during the warned time.
Amateur camera footage shared on social media can be heard a man on the top floor of a building screaming frantically to warn people on the street below about the upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach, putting buildings and vehicles in front of it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the camera image.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to officials, the military began sending cargo planes carrying aid from Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated still badly need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for rescue efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
In Indonesia, the Tsunami Bilanço exceeded 800.
It's too bad.
According to Mr. Doseba's statement, World Vision's team at Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, crossing the landscapes of destruction on the road, and employees staying in linoleum tents set up in the garden of their offices.
"They told me that they saw many destroyed houses," Doseba said.
It's too bad.
There are some complaints that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise have been prevented from going to Palu, even if aid groups are making a relentless effort to start disaster relief work.
According to regulations in Indonesia, money, supplies and human aid from abroad can only begin to flow if a disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
This ad has not yet been made.
"This is still a disaster at the regional level," Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Arriani said.
"We may be open to international assistance after the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' but there is no such status yet."
On the second night in Palu following Friday's earthquake and tsunami, families and relatives of missing persons still hold hope that there may be miracles that disrupt the unpleasant stories of natural disasters of their loved ones.
A young boy was removed from the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers removed a woman who had been trapped under a pile of stones caused by the flood for two days, along with her mother's body.
Indonesia paragliding national team coach Gendon Subbandono was running two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
According to Mr. Mandagi's information, the remains of those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"I'm pulling my own emotional burden as a veteran in the field of paragliding," he said.
Gendon described how the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's collapse circulated among the paragliding community, desperately sending WhatsApp messages to the Palu contestants attending the beach festival.
Their message, however, remained a grey check sign rather than a double blue check sign.
"I think that means the messages can't be forwarded," he said.
Thieves receive US$26,750 during ATM filling at Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who filled the ATM at Newport on the Levee, Newport Police Department reported.
In the news, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver was preparing to unload the ATM at the entertainment facility and load more money.
While the attendant was busy, another man stole the bag full of money to be loaded into the ATM "running behind the back of the Brink employee".
Witnesses said there were multiple suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Those who have information on the identities of these individuals need to contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes her name to Ye.
He announced this change on Twitter on Saturday, saying: "The person officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had been using the Ye mahla for some time and named it after his eighth album, released in June.
The change was made before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to introduce his new album, Yandhi.
According to the show's producer, he will replace Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons".
West had said that the word was an acronym for his current professional name, as well as important to him in the religious sense.
When West was talking to radio host Big Boy earlier this year about the title of his album, he said, "I think 'ye' means 'you' in the Bible,' the word most commonly used in the Bible."
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
From Kanye, which means one, our good, our evil, our confusion, has become Ye, a reflection of all of us.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's just one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs had various aliases, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, also uses his name as hyphenated or hyphenated and capitalized or lowercase.
Mexican AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed that the country would never use military force against civilians at the time of the 50th anniversary of the bloody act of retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would "never use military force to put the Mexican people under pressure".
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people in South America at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving students monthly benefits and opening up more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lured young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. must double AI funding
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner who had previously worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple, said the United States should double the amount it spent on research in this area, as China has increasingly increased its effectiveness in artificial intelligence.
After announcements of artificial intelligence from various U.S. public institutions were made, there were comments that the U.S. in general did not even have an official AI strategy.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Given that all other countries are far behind the United States and looking for the next big breakthrough in AI, it would be a good start to double the AI research budget," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, the doubling fund doubles the likelihood that the next major AI success will happen in the United States, Lee said.
His book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Lee is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, one of the most important artificial intelligence companies in China.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first-place American Othello (Reversi) player at Carnegie Mellon University, and later headed the Microsoft Research institution and Google's Chinese branch.
Lee asked when the next competition would be held to help identify the technology competitions that the U.S. government had previously held, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Institution's Robot Challenge, and the next visionaries.
Lee said that it usually takes a lot of work to get government support in the United States.
"The academic leaders are not China, the companies are catching up," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired intellectuals from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. study of artificial intelligence, Lee said.
"I think people who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should be automatically given a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the China Council released the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
Lee said the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provided funding to employees in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other public institutions distributed it to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work was lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence aimed at the participation of partners from the sector and academia, and the White House announced the creation of the Elect Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing $100 million annually in AI research.
On the other hand, there hasn't been a move in months on U.S. legislation seeking the creation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the country's name in referendum
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonian people voted whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" as a move to resolve the year-long dispute with Greece, which blocked European Union and NATO membership applications.
Greece, a region called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbour's name means a claim over Greek territory, and vetoes its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June over the proposed new name, but nationalist dissidents claim the new change would damage the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavs, who make up the majority of the population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the 50 percent turnout required for the referendum to be valid would be achieved.
The question on the referendum's ballot reads: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, the price is worth paying at the expense of admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, which expresses safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje, said.
Although it was not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would comply with the vote result to finalize the decision.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no rulelessness was reported until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout remained only at 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is Europe," Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje, said.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 to change the name of the country and pave the way for NATO and European Union accession in the Macedonian referendum.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small scene and lifting the seats in front of the tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to go in with our heads up, not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have honor.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to other options like China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate higher than 20 percent.
"I believe that because more than 80 percent of our citizens are pro-EU and pro-NATO, a large majority will vote positively," Zaev said after using the vote.
He said the "yes" result would be "to ensure our future".
A poll by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies last Monday suggested that between 30 and 43 percent of voters (below the required turnout) would participate in a referendum.
In another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV channel, 57 percent of respondents said they planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would say yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout needs to reach 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in my referendum will be the first serious blow the pro-Western government has taken to its policy since taking office in May of last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero beats all Brighton defense to reach goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling disbanded Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero was able to make his 65th minute goal funnyly easy.
The Argentine scorer received a pass in the midfield at the start of the series.
After running through three Brighton defenders, he reached the open field.
Then he surrounded Aguero in four green jerseys.
First he went over a defender and then left a few others behind on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he sent a pass to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to Aguero with his first touch on the penalty area, and Aguero struck the right side of the fort with his right foot, hunting Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero is struggling with some of the problems at his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked to him about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he threw the goal at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League fight.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero met at the Brighton field in that game.
Leroy from the left wing threw a nice ball at Sane.
Sane made a few touches before directing Sterling to the remote pole.
The forward of the Sky Blues sent the ball to the nets before sliding out of the field.
City will compete with Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer plans to break the game against the Rockies
With the Nationals saying goodbye to the qualifiers, there's not much left to push a new start.
But Scherzer, who has always had a competitive structure, hopes to sweep the field against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday if he still has a play-off chance for the Rockies, who have more wins than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West NL.
The Rockies have at least cemented their right to participate in a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but are still trying to win the first league title.
"Even if we have no purpose, we can do our best with the awareness that with the crowded atmosphere here in Denver, the opposing team will play at the highest level that I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a launcher for Sunday, but in such a case, it was reported that they could allow Scherzer to make the shot.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, had a warm-up workout on Thursday and will shoot in his normal place on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed player averaged 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts during 220 2/3 strokes this season.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican turnout to the midterm elections, the president indirectly addressed the situation experienced by Supreme Court candidate Kavanaugh.
"Everything we do is in danger in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's very, very big. I'm not running, but I'm actually running; so I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible radical Democratic group, you see what's happening now.
They are determined to take back power using whatever means necessary, you see their cruelty, their abominations.
They don't care who they hurt to take power and control, who they step on, and that's why they want power and control, but we won't give it to them."
He said the Democrats have embraced the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You've seen it for the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "angry and cruel, disgusting and lying."
When the Senate named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, the highest ranking judge on the Committee of Judges, higher booings rose from the crowd.
"Do you remember what he answered?
Did you leak the document?
Ah, ah, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one, the body language was so bad, it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Business Party is no longer a free thinking platform.
Those who say their opinions are not tolerated.
I wasn't surprised when Momentum activists at my local party voted to censor me.
I am, after all, the last person among Labour parliamentarians to be told that we are not well received because we say our opinions.
My parliamentary friend Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she took a determined stance against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion was criticizing me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Issues such as a responsible economic policy, national security, the importance of Europe, similar issues Jeremy has had disagreements with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I spent as a local parliamentarian of the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today is not the style of many meetings, and the promise of a "genter" policy has long been forgotten, even if it existed before.
It became increasingly clear in the Labour Party that he was being judged based on whether different views were tolerated and whether every idea was accepted by the party administration.
This came soon after Jeremy became a leader, and my friends, whom I had previously thought of as having a similar political opinion, asked me to make a U-turn on matters such as national security or the EU common market, and to take a stance that I would never accept.
Every time I speak publicly (it doesn't really matter what I say), I come across a series of insults that call for sobering up on social media, condemning the central's policies, and saying I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
I know I'm luckier than some of my friends because the comments I'm led by are usually political.
I respect and admire the professionalism and determination of these friends who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day and never withdraw themselves.
One of the saddest aspects of this political era is how defamation levels are normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn suggested last week that Labour should nurture a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer that platform of free thought, and with every motion of "insecurity" or a change of electoral rules, the party is narrowed down.
In the last two years, I've had a lot of advice about not getting involved in beef with milk, not making a lot of noise, and then it's going to be "all right."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student motivated by the omission of the Thatcher government that caused my comprehensive school class to fail, I have worked to provide better public services to those who need it most as a local councillor or minister.
I have never concealed my policies, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been confused about my political standing and the areas in which I disagree with the current administration.
All I'm going to say to those who support Friday's motion is that as the country moves forward with difficulty towards a Brexit that will harm home economies, businesses and our public services, I can't understand the desire to spend so much time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour administration.
But the message I really want to give is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents who are members of the Labour Party and who are not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no weeding threat or political interest can stop me from doing what I believe is best served in the interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr placed first
The two attempts in the last few minutes may have slightly changed the final result, but Ayr was definitely the side that deserved the victory in this very fun Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the league and are the only team without a defeat in ten teams.
In the end, thanks to their excellent defense as well as their better use of the chances that have come, the home team and coach Peter Murchie is very right to be pleased.
"So far we've tested our games and we're still not beaten, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they took the chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt, translated by Frazier Climo in the 14th minute, put Ayr forward, but the Warriors' game was released with the yellow card seen by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, so Melrose made the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot caught an untranslated try.
Climo led Ayr 17-5 to the break, making the number and turning a solo attempt as he entered the circuit after putting Ayr forward with a penalty.
Melrose, however, started out well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggot reduced the difference to five.
There was then a long pause during Ruaridh Knott's serious injury and gurney removal, and when the match resumed, Ayr made the difference with a Stafford McDowall trial translated by Climo.
Ayr's captain in the game, Blair Macpherson, saw a yellow card, and Melrose again used his excess man advantage with an untranslated Bruce Colvine attempt at the end of a hard press.
However, the home team came back as a result of Struan Hutchinson seeing a yellow card due to his interference with Climo in the ballless field and riveting the win with the touch of MacPherson from the penalty line.
Kyle Rowe picked up the ball after David Armstrong's box kick and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to try out the home team's fifth, then Climo, once again, almost pitched the conversion from the starting line.
Still Game star appears to be stepping into a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is set to enter the food industry, where the player turns out to be the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series where he co-wrote and starred with his long-running comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the final season of the series, apparently when Kiernan began planning how to continue his life after Craiglang ended.
According to official records, the actor appears to be the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, but a source reached by the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was planning to be thrown into Glasgow's "growing restaurant industry".
"Sea is ours": Bolivia, with no seashore, hopes court will reopen road to reach the Pacific
Marines patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz, armed with crests.
An ocean blue flag is flying in public buildings.
All naval bases from Lake Titikaka to the Amazon were covered with the slogan: "Our right to the sea.
It is our duty to receive this right to recuperate."
The memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource struggle in the 19th century continues to live in the memory of the Bolivian people who have no seashore, and once again the desire to open up to the Pacific Ocean has not yet been extinguished.
Nowadays, Bolivia's hopes have increased perhaps more than ever in recent years, with the country awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice (UAD), which will be held on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said, "Bolivia is full of energy, unity and a spirit of togetherness and tranquility, and of course expects the result from a positive point of view."
Across the country, many Bolivians will monitor the UAD's decision from large screens. After decades of irregular negotiations, Bolivia had appealed to the UAD, stating that Chile was obliged to negotiate giving Bolivia an independent piece of land for sea transportation. The Bolivian people are hopeful that the court in The Hague will accept Bolivia's request.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's native charismatic leader, also relied on the decision to be made on Monday. Morales faces a contentious fight for next year's re-election.
Morales had promised at the end of August, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
However, some analysts say the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favor, and there will be no serious change even if it decides in favor.
The UN agency in the Netherlands does not have the authority to give Chilean territory to Bolivia, and also stated that the institution will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the UAD reached a verdict just six months after the final defenses were made, according to Chilean international law expert Paz Zârate, shows that the case is "not complicated".
Moreover, talks over the past four years may have been against Bolivia rather than supporting its motives.
"The issue of access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian administration," he said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has also exhausted Chileans' last feelings of goodwill over the matter, according to Zârate.
Bolivia and Chile will be back at the table at a certain point, but it will be quite difficult to carry out negotiations from now on.
Neither country has sent ambassadors to each other since 1962.
The former president and Bolivia's representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodr-guez Veltze, denied allegations that the court had taken the decision at an unusually rapid rate.
In a statement, Veltze said Monday would offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and "will end 139 years of disagreements by benefiting both sides".
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue for his political interests.
According to Morales, "Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean."
"This decision is an opportunity for us to resolve past issues."
North Korea will not release nuclear weapons until it can rely on the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has announced that they will never give up nuclear weapons unless he can trust Washington.
Ri gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to carry out the promises made at the summit between the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
Ri's statements came three months after talks with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hinted that he was on the verge of restarting the impassed nuclear diplomacy talks.
Ri called the idea that the ongoing sanctions and the United States' opposition to the declaration to end the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees only as a "empty dream".
Washington is wary of signing the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps of disarmament.
Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is serious about giving up nuclear weapons, which it considers the only way to ensure security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The most recent huge collection of hats that you'll soon see in store's showcases was unveiled at Paris Fashion Week.
If you want to add bigger hats to your collection or block the sun altogether, it is now very easy to find the appropriate hats for you.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne showcased their incredible variety of accessories on the podium for the 2019 Spring/Summer collection, which also captivated the names that set the style trends at Paris Fashion Week.
The hats, which were not very useful this summer, were all over Instagram, and the designers of these hats put their dazzling designs on the podium.
One of Valentino's prominent designs, decorated with feather-like details, was a wide-edged beige hat that covered the entire head of the model.
Other oversized accessories include watermelons decorated with precious stones, a wizard's hat, even a pineapple, but of course these accessories are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne presented another collection of strange masks, which was also very appropriate for the spirit of the upcoming Halloween.
The mouth part of most of the colored masks had been stitched and the masks resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture designs.
One of the designs was similar to a complete scuba diving equipment with snorkels and sea glasses, while another was reminiscent of a melted ice cream cone.
You're lucky if you're following massive fashion trends.
Style experts say that these huge hats could soon be featured in store windows.
The big hats quickly became trendy along with the collection "La Bomba", which we saw in everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Behind the impractical hat fashion that spreads on social media, this brand presented a larger design in its fashion show: the wicker beach bag it carried appeared on a model podium in swimsuits that was almost as large as itself.
The prominent design of the La Riviera 2019 Spring/Summer collection, which Jacquemus unveiled at the Paris Fashion Week, was a bag on a dark orange shelf decorated with shelving tassels and complemented with a white leather bag handle.
Luke Armitage, the celebrity stylist, told FEMAIL about these designs: "I expect big hats and beach bags to take their place in storefronts next summer. The designer has made such an impact that it will be very difficult to deny demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are of great importance to citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have an academically successful history, and in 2018, this success was sustained by outstanding test results, supported by sports, art, music, and other civil society studies.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), these schools work to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their later education and higher education, their chosen career, and becoming world citizens.
As educational institutions that can prepare and implement a special curriculum for students, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and essential course in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in the language he understands,
If you speak native language, you will be addressing your heart."
If we want to connect with people from other countries and build mutual trust, this promise is a strong reminder that we should not rely solely on English.
Based on this year's final exam results, we can see that language classes in independent schools are at the top of the scoreboards with the highest passing grade rates.
This year, a total of 68% of students taking foreign language courses passed their courses with A, a high grade.
According to data collected from SCIS' 74 member schools, 72 percent of students taking Chinese courses, 72 percent of those taking German, 69 percent of those taking French, and 63 percent of those taking Spanish passed their courses with A.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language courses as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Language courses, which are elective courses, are now valued in the curricula of independent schools and other schools with FeTeMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) courses.
A 2014 study by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of the reasons employers have trouble getting new employees into vacant positions is related to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming even more imperative in preparing young people for their future careers.
These skills have been essential skills in the globalizing world, as more employers are required to know the language for possible job opportunities.
If a person knows a second language regardless of his or her chosen career, he or she will have a real advantage in the future because he or she has this skill that he or she can use for life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from outside countries spontaneously puts more than one multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, 75% of the more than 4,000 people living in the United Kingdom do not speak enough foreign languages to converse, and with the exception of French (15%) in no foreign language, the proportion of people who speak the language does not reach a two-digit number.
Therefore, investing in language learning from today is of great importance to the children of the future.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will increase the chances of children finding a suitable and reasonable job for them in the future.
The languages taught in schools in Scotland vary.
Certain schools offer more traditional modern language options, while some schools also teach languages that are thought to be important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Your child may choose one of the various foreign language options taught by expert teachers in this field in independent schools, no matter what field he or she is interested in.
Scottish independent schools aim to provide a teaching environment that will prepare children for the future and equip them with the skills necessary for success.
In today's global business environment, it is an unmistakable fact that foreign languages continue to be vital to the country's future, which must also be reflected in real educational life.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and success to young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron to wear Lakers jersey for the first time in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first game of the Los Angeles Lakers will be over soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would also be on the field in a pre-season opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it is not clear how many minutes he will play.
Walton stated on the Lakers official website that "this time will be longer than a minute, less than 48 minutes".
According to a tweet by Lakers reporter Mike Trudell, James will likely be on the field for a limited time.
Following this week's training, James was asked about the Lakers' plans for their six-game pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-season games to prepare for this stage of my career," James said.
The Clock of Trump's West Virginia Rally, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins his busy rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This rally will be the first of five Trump rallies to take place next week, with breakpoints such as Tennessee and Mississippi to welcome Trump as friendly.
Trump's approval vote for the candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court's vacated member roster has been suspended. Trump aims to gain public support in the upcoming midterm elections for the Republican Party, which is at risk of losing its standings in Congress in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how can you watch the rally online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern (US and Canada) time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on the YouTube channel below.
Trump will most likely address the session this week on Brett Kavanaugh, whom he nominated for membership in the Supreme Court. The allegations of sexual assault and the suspension of the approval vote, which is expected to take place in the Senate, for up to a week during the FBI investigation, caused the session to be tense.
However, the main goal of this intensive rally program is to help the Republican Party gain momentum, which faces the risk of defeat in the November election.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign spokespeople stated that the aim of the five rallies next week was "to mobilize volunteers and supporters to protect and expand the Republican Party's supremacy in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"Congress' control is so important to the president's agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible during the busy campaign period," a spokesman for the Trump campaign told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the rally scheduled to be held tonight at Wheeling Wesbanco Arena "may attract supporters in Ohio and Pennsylvania states and take part in the Pittsburgh media."
Trump will visit the state twice in the past month, with a rally on Saturday, when the president of the United States won the 2016 election in the state of West Virginia by more than a hundred percent.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Party's West Virginia Senate candidate, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and support Morrisey in the polls," says Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: As we approach the Sunday singles matches, the U.S. team remains determined to fight to keep their hopes alive.
The four-way (foursome) matches, which took place Saturday afternoon after three one-sided matches, brought vitality to the Ryder Cup.
The fact that momentum is constantly moving from one team to another throughout the competition is a completely fabricated sports concept, but athletes wholeheartedly believe in this concept, especially in games like this.
So who do the players think has momentum right now?
"They started six points ahead of the day and that difference is now down to four, so I'd say we've gained a little momentum," Jordan Spieth said as he completed the day.
Of course, the European team, which was four points ahead and could win another twelve points in the match, finished the day with an advantage.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that they are taking the wind behind them, and many factors encourage Americans, especially the fact that Spieth and Justin Thomas, who play together throughout the day, are in shape and both score three out of four holes.
Spieth set an example for everyone, performing perfectly from the starting point to the end point.
Throughout Spieth's round, the cries of victory from the throat grew stronger and stronger, with Spieth making the putting stroke, which was of great importance to bring the score to a draw after losing points in both of the holes with Thomas.
The putting strike in the 15th hole, which won the game for the American team, again brought similar cries of joy, indicating that Spieth believed the American team was continuing to fight.
"You have to push yourself and think only about your own performance," Spieth said.
Right now, all players need to think about it.
There are 18 holes left where they can make a difference.
In the last two days, the only two to score more points than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, two of Ryder Cup's undisputed most prominent players.
Europe's different but adorable duo scored points in four of the four holes and made no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only two to not make a bogey hit on Saturday afternoon, and they also avoided bogey hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning on the last nine back nine grannies.
These performances and their energy are enthusiastically crowded, and in return, the power they receive from the crowd supports the idea that they will win on Sunday, possibly as the day ends at Le Golf National, Fleetwood or Molinari will become the most popular players to finalize a potential European victory.
Preferably, both are expected to bring this victory in different holes at the same time.
However, it is still too early to discuss the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning football games, and Alex Noren in the match.
A bogey and two double bogey hits in the first nine pits led the Spanish and Swedish player to remain on a bad score, which they did not survive until the end of the match.
But on Sunday, no one can help change the bad score.
Being able to watch the Fourball and four-way matches closely gives a truly fascinating experience, seeing the interaction between couples, the advice they give each other or hide from each other, and the ability to instantly change strategy.
Europe has performed better as a team so far and entered the final day by a serious margin, but it has shown that these four matches, especially the U.S. team, have not lost their fighting resolve and would have removed doubts on the U.S. side.
Europe takes 10-6 lead in Ryder Cup final day
On Saturday, the European team, which finished their fourball and four-way (foursome) match in a 10-6 lead against the U.S. team, enters the final day of the Ryder Cup with a huge advantage.
Exciting duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charts, winning two victories against Tiger Woods to score four points so far at Le Golf National.
Aiming to win the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team triumphed over the American team who failed to hit the target in the morning football match and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. took two matches with more resistance in the mated tournament, but failed to melt the difference.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while Molinari, who took the name "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, and he was the second pair to win four points in four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in their team play, they were perfectly prepared to defeat the dull Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a much more effective 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of perfection, but lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four tournaments for the time being and has a seven-game defeat streak.
Resting for four ball games in the morning, Justin Rose merged with his partner Henrik Stenson against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively, and suffered a 2&1 defeat.
Yet Europe, on a pleasant and airy day in the south of Paris, was unable to run things as it pleased.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
After winning a tough 2&1 in a four-ball against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, they defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 even though they lost the first two holes in the four-game.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup does a team come down four points to singles, but as a trophy holder, it is enough for the Furyk team to win a tie to hold the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday will be well beyond their strength.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament "in no way" is possible without confidence
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing embargoes in the country deepened mistrust of the United States, and under these circumstances the country could not unilaterally relinquish its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the world establishment's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising that it would not produce nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Despite this, we don't see the return from the United States," he added.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not be able to have faith in our own national security, and under these circumstances we will have no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Ri rephrases the familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance against a "staged" approach that North Korea will be rewarded for taking gradual steps, while his statements seem important because he unilaterally did not reject the removal of nuclear weapons as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri made a reference to joint statements by Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un at a summit between the incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, where Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear denuclearization of the Korean peninsula".
North Korea is looking for ways to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington was also resisting calls to loosen tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'first denuclearization' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objectives in compelling ways, even opposing 'war being declared to be over'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is the empty dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions reinforce our insecurity."
Ri made no hint of a second summit plan between US leader Trump and Kim, which was highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he emphasized three talks between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If this issue of denuclearization had been addressed by South Korea and not the United States, the issue of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been this blind knot."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from last year's speech at the UN General Assembly last year, when "Mr. Devil President" Trump said it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would target the U.S. mainland after Kim called him a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for having the courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said there is still much work to be done and sanctions should continue until North Korea is free of nuclear.
On Wednesday, Trump said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months," there is no time frame for that.
China and Russia claimed that because of the steps taken, the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue with violence and without any failure until full, definitive and verified nuclear decommissioning is carried out."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an effort to stop the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri during the UN General Assembly, after which he said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Hours after leaving Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, North Korea had condemned him, saying he had put forward "mafian demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile field and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "reciprocal measures".
Moon said Kim's "countermeasures" they were looking for were Trump's security guarantees in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take enough rest classes
This year at Harvard University, a new course leads all of its students to sleep more in order to combat the growing macho culture of 'all-nighters' studying through caffeine.
One academic found that students of the world's number one university were unaware of even the most basic information when it came to taking care of themselves.
In the United States, Charles Czeisler, a Harvard Medical School sleep treatment professor and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first of its kind.
He drew inspiration from a speech he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning ability.
"At the end of the conversation, a female student came to me and said, 'Why is all this being said to me now, when I'm in my senior year?'"
He said that no one has ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much."
Opened for the first time this year, the course explains the basics of how good sleep habits help students achieve academic and athletic performance, and also improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general manager of health care at the university, said the university decided to open the course after realizing that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course contains a series of interactive tasks.
One chapter includes a dorm room picture where students listen to the effects of coffee and light by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of regular sleep.
In another episode, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their own daily routines.
"We know that students will not change their behavior instantly.
However, we believe that if you have the right to learn how to choose to smoke, they have the right to learn the same way," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of "working all night" still exists, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students, namely sleep deprivation, is a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and ensuring that sleep is of good quality should be the "secret weapon" for students to struggle with stress, fatigue and anxiety, even to avoid gaining too much weight, because sleep deprivation causes students to feel hungry all the time as the brain puts them into starvation mode, he said.
Raymond So, who studied chemical and physical biology from California at the age of 19, took a class of Professor Czeisler in his first year at school last year, and assisted Professor Czeisler in designing the course.
He said the lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to create campus-wide awareness.
In the next step, he hopes to ask his graduate students to complete a similar course before joining competitive institutions.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm to the time they will wake up, as well as to the time they will sleep, and warns them of the harmful effects of "blue light", which disrupts the daily rhythm emitted from electronic displays and LED lights, causing problems of falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeats Gerrard's men
As Dolly Menga's hit leads Steven Gerrard's disorganized team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston, Rangers suffers another away upset.
The Ibrox team had been trying to win their first away win since the 4-1 St Johnstone win in February, but Gary Holt's team exposed Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager, beating his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the low-spirited Rangers never seemed to recover.
Now the Rangers are down to sixth, while Livingston is only one goal behind Hibernian.
It also seems that more problems are on the way for Rangers after the clearly far-off foreign matter has hit the side referee, Calum Spence, and the wound at the referee's head has been treated.
Gerrard switched eight players on his team, removing Ayr from the Betfred Cup semi-final eleven.
Holt, on the other hand, made no changes to Livingston 11, which scored a point from Hearts last week, and he could be happy that his solid team was not giving up on his opponent at every opportunity.
Although Rangers dominated the ball, Livingston managed to do more with the ball they had.
Menga's first short pass, Scott Pittman, was supposed to have found the goal in the second minute he sent Allan McGregor towards his goal, but the midfielder missed it by a huge margin.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free kick later found captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow hit the ball out of the back.
Although Rangers took control, there seemed to be more hope in their games than faith in the last thirty minutes.
When he collided with Steven Lawless as he entered the last fifteen minutes of the game, Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that they had obtained a penalty, but referee Steven Thomson did not heed the Colombian's objections.
Rangers managed to send only two of their shots to the fort in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no trouble getting Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejaria's calm kick.
Although Livingston's game in the first 34 minutes has enjoyed the game, no one can deny that they have won the win with their hard work.
Again, Rangers couldn't take care of Jacobs' deep-standing ball.
Declan Gallagher sent the ball towards Scott Robinson, who would send it to Menga for an easy finish, while Scott Arfield made no moves.
Gerrard took out Ryan Kent during the half-time, replacing him with Coulibaly, who immediately showed his influence when the winger sent the ball to Morelos, but the effective goalkeeper, Kelly, jumped out of the castle, blocking the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to lure his guests into the game, where they enjoyed playing with the long balls that Lithgow and Halkett sent in succession.
Holt's team could have raised the difference in the final stages of the game, but McGregor stood up to block Jacobs before Lithgow had a wide headshot from the corner.
Rangers backup Glenn Middleton asked for a penalty for his team again after colliding with Jacobs towards the end of the match, but referee Thomson again ignored the request.
Almanac: inventor of Geiger Counter
Now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years before today and ON THE WAY TO SAY... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually bring with it the device known as the Geiger Counter.
Geiger Counter, one of the indispensables of science since then, has become one of the indispensables of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who seemingly did not appear to be.
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, used to find radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms distributed by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Really, they're definitely exploding now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
However, his invention, bearing his name, continues to live on.
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malicious cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" and kill malicious cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malicious cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from patients and othering them in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" the protein common in many cancer cells and are re-injected.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with varying levels of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize malicious cells, saw her breast cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the immune cell from patients, altering it in the laboratory, allowing them to "see" the protein HER2 found in many cancer cells, and re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancer," explained Prof. Berzofsky, including breast, uterus, lung, and colon cancers.
A similar approach to "teach" how to take immune cells from patients and target them with cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West Joined Trump Supporter Discussions After She Came Out to SNL Wearing a MAGA Hat.
It Didn't Go Good For Him
Kanye was booed in the studio during the West Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would also sit in the presidential office in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great hat, he rants about the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I've talked to a white person many times and they said to me, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I had concerns about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star Christine Blasey mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee against Ford's charges of sexual harassment.
Although not aired, images of West's speeches were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to mock West by uploading the video.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time behind the scenes because of his hat on his head.
"They bullied me behind the scenes.
"Don't go on stage with that hat," they said.
They bullied me!
Then they say I'm in a sunken place," according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see a sunken place?" and say, "I'm going to pass my super cape, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
According to Variety, West's comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and SNL caste players seemed embarrassed, with one person from around telling the press: "The whole studio is buried in its dead silence."
West had been called at the last minute instead of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier, who was unable to attend the show.
West had surprised many with his song I Love it, disguised as a Perrier Bottle.
West received support from a conservative group, TPUSA president Candace Turner, with the following tweet: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR STOPPING THE CABLE."
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was nobody but him and it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose not to reward someone who I think embraces and distributes ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying his music or his outfit, or by "supporting" his art).
He's a free man.
So are we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "officially known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion, of course the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and became the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder in Belfast restaurant stabbing case
On Friday, a 45-year-old indictee of the incident was charged with attempted murder following the stabbing of a person at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
Police reported that the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear in the Belfast Peace Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticises toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his character Jon Snow, the warrior in HBO's fantasy medieval series Game of Thrones, which includes scenes of violence.
But the 31-year-old actor made harsh criticisms of the macho hero stereotype, stating that the prominence of such roles on the screen often led young men to feel that they had to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Cultural supplement, Kit said he thought "some things didn't work out" and questioned how to tackle the toxic masculinity problem during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a co-star on Game of Thrones, who is also 31 years old, stated that he was "deeply considering" going over the problem.
Kit said, "I'm personally thinking deeply about this right now. What have we done wrong about masculinity?
In terms of this problem that we are experiencing now, what are we teaching them wrong as men grow up?"
Kit believes television may have a share in the strengthening of toxic masculinity due to too many masculin characters.
Kit continued, "What has been born, what has been taught?
What are young men being taught on television and on the street, who feel compelled to have certain characteristics of masculinity?
I think one of the most important questions of our time is: How can we change that?
Because it's clear that things don't work out for young men."
Kit said in an interview that he would not play in episodes or sequels that tell the history of the series characters after Game of Thrones ended next summer, and that he was "borrowed from battlefields and horses".
Kit will play in Sam Shepard's remake of the Wild West in November, where the play tells the story of a filmmaker and his thieving brother.
The actor recently announced that the most beautiful thing the Game of Thrones series has added to him is his meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way, the show offered me my future family and my life after that," Kit said.
Rose had played the lover of the character Jon Snow, played by Kit in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married at Leslie's family home in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens with HIV and Aids.
According to health officials, the virus affected more than 820,000 people in the country.
More than 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Unlike past cases, many of the new cases were reported to be sexually transmitted.
In the past, the HIV virus had spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, Chinese health officials, who made statements at a conference in Yunnan province, said that the number of people infected with HIV by blood transfusion has dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China increased by 100,000 each year.
HIV virus transmitted through sexual intercourse is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality is reported to have been decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT individuals continues.
Studies have estimated that between 70 and 90% of men who have had sexual relations with men marry women because of the country's conservative values.
The disease is transmitted mostly because of insufficient attention to protection during these same-sex relationships.
The Chinese government has pledged to provide general access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to combat the disease from 2003.
Maxine Waters criticized "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories", rejecting the claim that one of her employees leaked data from Republican Party senators.
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday that one of her employees shared the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on senators' Wikipedia pages.
Democratic-Party Los Angeles MP Waters suggested that the allegations were supported by "far-right" political commentators and websites.
Waters said on Twitter, "Lies, lies, and lower lies."
Among the information shared are the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
This information about the Members of Congress was posted online on Thursday by an unidentified person during a Senate group session on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to a report on Hill, conservative opinion websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and released information from one of Waters' employees.
"These unfounded allegations are completely false and outright lies," Waters said of the issue.
"My employee, whose identity, personal information and security are compromised because of these false and unfounded allegations, is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded claims are completely false and outright lies."
Waters's statement drew a reaction from some people on the Internet, and White House press secretary Ari Fleischer was among those who voiced his reaction.
Fleischer wrote in his statement, "This is an angry lie."
"It shows that Waters does not have the necessary restraint to become a Congressman.
One should not be angry when accused of a crime he did not commit.
Critics should not show intolerance.
He should not question the intentions of the accuser.
It needs to be calm and comfortable."
Fleischer compared Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to Waters, who was criticized by Democrats for appearing very angry during Thursday's session.
Republican Omar Navarro, who ran for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter:
"If it's true, it'll move."
Waters said in a statement that his office "informs relevant officials and law enforcement about these false allegations".
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and that they are accountable to the law for their dangerous actions that could harm all of my employees," Waters said in a statement.
Johnny English review of his film Back in Business: Rowan Atkinson's inadequate agent parody
It has now become a tradition to link all new British-made films to Brexit, and we can continue this tradition for the Johnny English action comedy parody, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and re-enacted in 2011 with Johnny English's Return.
Will our country have a new export opportunity, our ironic film, in which we are self-inflicted about how messed up we are?
At the very least, the clumsy Johnny English character, who stands out with his bursting eyes and moving gestures, has been able to renew his license to mess everything up once again. In fact, even the name Johnny English suggests that the character is an inclusive comedy element developed for non-English-speaking movie lovers.
Johnny English is an absurd undercover agent inspired by a character who, despite his strangely confident and friendly charm, accompanied some Clouseau, some Mr. Bean, and some Chariots of Fire promotional music at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
In fact, for his role as a secret agent, he was also inspired by an international mystery traveler portrayed by Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, who created chaos at the end of everything he did.
In this new Johnny English movie, you can see a few funny scenes.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter in medieval battle armor and hit the helicopter propeller's helmet and made a sound.
Atkinson's physical comedy skill is eye-catching, but I found the humor element in the film very weakly and oddly unnecessary, especially considering that "serious" films like 007 and Mission Danger also confidently incorporate comedy material into their scripts, the film's humor can be seen to be excessive.
His sense of humor in the film seems more directed towards children than adults, and I don't think the bizarre misfortunes that have happened to Johnny English are as creative and thought-out as the misfortunes in Atkinson's character in the silent film comedy Bean.
In this film of the series, the issue deals with the fact that Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cybercriminal infiltrates Britain's top-secret network of agents, revealing the identities of all agents working on the field in the UK and appalling the agent holding the night watch. Unfortunately, we can only see Kevin Eldon, who plays the vigilante character, in this small role in the film.
For a struggling, self-righteous prime minister whose political popularity has reached a point of complete depletion, this is the last straw: Emma Thompson has done everything in her power to best portray this character who looks like Theresa May, but the script does not offer enough good text to work on and improve on.
The prime minister's intelligence advisers state that all active agents have been identified and that he has to assign a retired agent to do so.
This retired agent also becomes the incompetent Johnny English. Johnny English teaches at a school where rich students study after retirement while also teaching how to become a secret agent off the record: there were some funny jokes in these scenes where English founded a School of Rock type agenting academy.
English is immediately taken to Whitehall Palace for an emergency briefing meeting, and is reunited with Bough, the former abettor, who is again portrayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is married to a submarine officer, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays Bough's wife, has been a bit wasted on the role.
Known for terriblely ruining everything in Her Majesty's Secret Service, the two embark on an adventure again and meet the beautiful femme fatale character Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister falls under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problem: this evil character named Jason Volta is portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their adventure of absurd fun: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a luxury French restaurant; while secretly attempting to board Volta's luxury yacht, they cause turmoil. English causes complete chaos when trying to use the Virtual Reality glasses to learn about Volta's house's plan.
All of these events connect to a point at the end of the script, but the film, however cute and flamboyant, has a sense of humor in television programs for children in general.
The jokes are rather mediocre.
Like other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think about this: Can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
The Labour Party has denied claims that it has developed a plan for British employees to work four days a week and receive five days' wages.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to develop a radical plan that includes working four days a week without any cuts to employees' salaries.
Rumor has it that the party wants its corporate bosses to extend the week break for another day, allowing workers to benefit from savings made through artificial intelligence.
According to the plan, employees will have three days of the week off but will continue to receive the same fee.
Sources of the news said that the idea was "appropriate" to the party's economic agenda and to its plans to guide the country to policies that are beneficial to workers.
The British Congress of Labor Unions also supports the offer to work four days a week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected by the end of the year.
This is not a plan that can happen overnight, but the idea of working four days a week is a request in line with the party's policy of rebalancing the economy in favor of workers and its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first party to put forward this idea.The Greens Party promised to work four days a week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this request is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day work-week plan is not among the party's policies and is not currently considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell detailed his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from "unidentified executives" and "rentists" in public services firms.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies will not be able to recover all of their shares in the company, as the Labour government can make "disambiguations" if it is deemed to be corrupt.
McDonnell also confirmed plans for workers to be on the company's board of directors. The Shadow Chancellor also plans to create Comprehensive Property Funds for private sector firms to hand over 10 percent of their equity to employees. The ten percent rate means a maximum annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy announced on the program "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation would change their minds about Kavanaugh.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh caused the judge's eventual vote to run for Supreme Court membership to be delayed by at least a week, which raises the question of whether Republican senators would be willing to support them due to the findings that may arise in the FBI report.
In Sunday's "60 Minutes" interview, reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible to come up with a finding that could change their minds in an FBI investigation.
Kennedy seemed more open to changing his mind compared to his South Carolina colleague.
Kennedy said in an interview, "Of course,
On the way to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this claim was made, I called him and said, 'Did you do that?'
Kavanaugh was brave, determined and clear," he said.
On the other hand, Graham seems less likely to change the game.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it has to be a very serious accusation to change my mind," Graham said.
Graham addressed Christine Blasey Ford, who made the claim, saying, "Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett, he absolutely rejected that claim."
"No one named by Ford can confirm this claim.
It's been 36 years since the incident.
I don't think you have anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and What Has It Done to Reduce Poverty?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival this Saturday, an annual music event featuring highly impressive stars, the event's mission being as ambitious as the artists on the stage: ending poverty worldwide.
Tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park for the seventh edition of the Global Citizen Festival this year, watching the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, as well as raising awareness of the event's mission to end extreme poverty by 2030, the main goal of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. The Global Poverty Project is an international pressure group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively struggling with poverty.
Those who wish to attend the concert must perform certain tasks or "actions" in order to win a free ticket to the event if they do not want to pay for the VIP ticket, including volunteering, e-mailing world leaders, calling specific people, or performing other meaningful tasks that will help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
So how successful was the Global Citizen Festival, which had 12 years to accomplish its goal?
Does giving people free concert tickets really convince people to demand action, or is there something called "clickivism" that makes people feel like they're really making a difference by signing a petition online or tweeting a tweet?
The Global Citizen movement reported that its supporters were in 19 million "actions" from 2011 when many different targets were requested to be realized.
According to the Global Citizen group, these actions contributed to the world's leaders' statement of commitments and declarations reaching a total budget of more than US$37 billion, and these commitments and declarations are intended to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported that 390 commitments and declarations were announced as a result of the actions of supporters, with at least US$10 billion already being paid or collected.
The Global Citizen group estimates that the funds secured have so far directly affected the lives of about 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key organizations in the commitments is the UK-based "The Power of Nutrition" association, a partnership of investors and project practitioners who aim to "help children grow up by realizing all their potential." The association pledged to donate US$35 million to the country to help end the malnutrition problem in Rwanda after receiving 4700 tweets from Global Citizen supporters.
Tracey Ullman, ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, told viewers at a live concert in April 2018: "With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and supporters of Global Citizen like you, we can eliminate the problem of malnutrition, which is a social injustice."
After calling on the British government to take action on improving maternal and child nutrition, the government announced that it would provide funding for the The Power of Nutrition project and that the project would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In the Frequently Asked Questions section on the Global Citizen Festival's website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But we will succeed because we are stronger together, like all civil rights movements and anti-discrimination movements before us.
The event, which will be presented in New York this year by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman, will also feature artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mone.
Home Secretary says US could use Navy for a "bluka" to block Russian energy exports
U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said they could use the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy supplies from reaching world markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's Syrian intervention is an excuse to explore new energy markets, but Russia is carrying out its operations in Syria on the call of the legitimate government.
"I think [the Russians'] goal in intervening in the Middle East is to make energy deals, as in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," Zinke said.
He also suggested that there were various ways and means to combat it.
"As the United States, we have the power to ensure that maritime routes remain open thanks to our Navy, and if necessary, we can close those roads so that Russian energy does not reach the markets," Zinke said.
Ryan Zinke addressed the participants at the event in the United States, where the non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance group was held, which described him as "the voice of the energy consumer".
During his speech, Zinke compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, stating that these two countries are in almost the same situation.
"One of the economic options at our table on Iran and Russia is to put pressure on them and take their place in terms of energy," Zinke said, describing Russia as a country that "achieves in one area" with its economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements were made on top of the mission initiated by the Trump administration to replace Russian natural gas, a much cheaper alternative for European consumers, and to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe.
In the context of this mission, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are working to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. According to Trump, this project has made Berlin the "secret" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project is just an economic project, which will double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres.
The Kremlin says that there are only economic reasons under Washington's fierce opposition to the project, and that this is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Secretary Aleksandr Novak, who met with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry at a meeting in Moscow in September, noted: "I believe we agree that energy cannot be used as a means of pressure enforcement and consumers should be free to choose the supplier they want."
The U.S. stance drew Germany's reaction, which expressed its commitment to the project again.
The German Industrial Federation (BDI), one of Germany's leading companies in the field of industry, called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am deeply disturbed by the interference of third-party companies in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industrial Federation, after a meeting recently between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren Says She Will Think "Effectively" About Running in 2020 Presidential Race
Massachusetts Senate Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would consider running for president "outstanding" following the midterm elections.
Warren, who attended a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, confirmed he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the corrupt government system, and for that, a woman needs to get to the top," reports Hill.
"After November 6th, I will consider the presidential nomination thoroughly," Warren said.
Warren, who also commented on President Donald Trump at a city council meeting, said Trump had "stuck the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," he said.
Warren had voiced criticism of Trump and Trump's Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Monday, the senator said "of course the FBI needs to investigate before voting".
On the other hand, according to a poll released on Thursday, most of Warren's own supporters do not want him to run in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Centre for Political Studies/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of "possible" Massachusetts voters stated that the senator should not be a candidate.
Thirty-two percent support running for office.
The poll showed that the number of people supporting Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy was higher, with Patrick's candidacy being thirty-eight percent, while those opposed to his candidacy were forty-eight percent.
Other prominent Democratic candidates named as candidates in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will have officially decided whether to run or not by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
Track Palin arrested on Monday night for alleged violence against woman
Sarah Palin addressed the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma: "After what my own son went through when he returned to his country, I understand better the suffering of post-traumatic stress disorder and the injuries that our soldiers brought with them."
Palin suggested that his son's arrest reflected a "obvious fact" about his son and other veterans, commenting that "they're returning a little changed from the war and emotionally hardened, wondering if their gun mates, pilots and other members of the military in the ground forces will be respected for the sacrifices they've made for this country."
Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Center, announced on Monday that Track Palin had been arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on charges of violence against women, attempting to intervene in the reporting of the violence, and holding a gun while drunk.
18 states and the District of Columbia support appeal to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal appeals to the new U.S. policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia in Washington submitted an expert report to the court in support of an asylum seeker objecting to the new policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name was not revealed in the case of Grace versus Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August to appeal federal policy.
Grace stated that her partner and her "violent gang-member sons" were violent to her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Grace, Texas.
Advocates for Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, the homeland of most of the people applying for asylum in the United States, as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence issues.
Along with the new US asylum policy, the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision, which allowed people fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum, was broken.
Columbia District Attorney Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "disappears to ignore federal and international laws by state laws".
"Federal law states that all asylum claims must be decided according to the specific situation and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the expert said in the report.
In addition, lawyers argued that failure to grant immigrants access to the new policy in the report damaged the U.S. economy, with immigrants more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions requested judges handling immigration cases in June not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Sessions announced the policy on June 11th, explaining that "people who have been persecuted or fear persecution because of the race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion they belong to, and therefore who have left their country may apply for asylum."
"The policy of asylum certainly does not aim to alleviate all the problems that people face every day all over the world, even if these problems are serious problems, the situation is the same."
In Palu, where the death toll has doubled, relief teams race over time to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who tried to comfort her hot baby at an evacuation center in the city of Palu, where hope is running out, said, "I feel very nervous.
Every minute an ambulance arrives carrying the bodies.
We are experiencing a shortage of clean water," he said.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes to collect their water-damaged belongings and save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured in the disaster, and hospitals damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake were flooded with wounded people.
Some wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who had fractures to his spine and shoulder, were treated in the garden of the Palu Military Hospital, where the wounded were treated in front of the hospital due to strong aftershocks.
Haris described in tears how he felt during the severe earthquake in the room where he was staying with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
In an interview with the Associated Press, Haris quoted those moments as saying, "We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I'm stuck under the rubble." Haris and his family had come to the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of bullying using "propaganda ads"
The official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad praising the mutual advantages of U.S.-China trade in a daily newspaper published in the U.S. A week after this ad, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to spread its propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the paid advertisement published last Wednesday by China Daily in the Iowa state's best-selling newspaper Des Moines Register. Trump began his statements by accusing China of interfering in the November 6th congressional election. China denies allegations of interference.
According to U.S. officials speaking to Reuters, Trump's charge of trying to interfere in the U.S. election shows a new stage in the campaign initiated and expanded by Washington to put pressure on China.
It is common for foreign governments to publish ads aimed at promoting trade, but due to the deepening trade war between Beijing and Washington, both countries impose high customs duties on each other for imports.
According to US experts, in the early stages of the trade war, China's tariffs on retaliation were intended to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the long-term former governor of the state of Iowa, who exported agricultural products to China, said Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in a column written by Des Moines Register for Sunday's edition that China "doubled its tyranny by publishing propaganda ads in free American media".
Branstad wrote: "The Chinese government takes advantage of the principle of freedom of expression and free press traditions that America is firmly committed to by publishing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register to spread its propaganda."
"On the other hand, when you go to a newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you can see that there are a small number of newspapers that publish dissenting views, and you will find no publication that accurately reflects the different views of the Chinese on the country's difficult economic course, because the media is under the strict control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
Branstad stated in his article that "one of China's leading newspapers rejected his offer to publish his article", but did not name the paper.
Analysts Say Republicans Dismissed Female Voters Before Midterm Elections With Kavanaugh Fiasco
Leading figures in the Republican Party supported and defended Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, while analysts warned that Republicans would be particularly likely to react to women in the upcoming midterm elections.
People's feelings were quite strong, and most Republicans made statements that they wanted to continue voting.
Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell Institute at Syracuse University, stated in a statement for an article published on Hill on Sunday that "such statements cannot be undone".
Reeher doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona representative) insistently requesting an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to please the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday. They will remember what happened in the future and in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
According to Mic, members of the Republican Party, who make up the majority of the Judicial Committee, protestors chanted "November is approaching!" in the corridors of the Senate, as Dr. Christine Blasey chose to continue the candidacy process regarding Kavanaugh despite Ford's testimony.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be unorthodox," Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told a news site.
"People say enthusiasm and motivation are already high; that thought is true.
But when they don't like the president in the contested constituency areas, the motivation of female voters in the suburbs, who usually don't vote, and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, can get even higher," he said.
Before Ford's public statement, which detailed allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, had yet to take place, analysts suggested that members of the Republican Party could face a reaction if they insisted for approval.
Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, said, "This has become an insurmountable issue for the Republican Party."
Guy Cecil, the director of Priorities USA, who helped the Democratic Party in the elections, told a news channel, "The issue is not just whether the committee votes, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is a member of the Supreme Court, but also how the members of the Republican Party handle the issue and how they treat Ford."
On the other hand, the Americans seem to have been split on who to believe after Ford's and Kavanaugh's statements, and the number of those who side with Ford is slowly increasing.
According to YouGov's new survey, 41 percent of respondents said they believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in Kavanaugh's testimony, in or in part.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents thought that Kavanaugh was lying for sure or possibly during his testimony, while the proportion of people using the same statement for Ford was limited to only 30 percent.
According to the Guardian, the FBI began investigating the claims of Ford and at least one other complainant after Flake's request, the second complainant involved in the investigation was Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified on the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that he had been sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh, who was under the influence of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez, on the other hand, claimed that Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, showed him his genitals during a party during which they attended while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web's Inventor Plans to Launch a New Internet Project to Compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new startup that aims to rival companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project in technology legend, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to determine where the data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that Inrupt's original intention was "to dominate the world".
"We had to do this now," Lee said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology, which allows users to create their own "personal online data storage space" or otherwise, POD.
This storage space can include contact lists, calendar, to-do lists, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
The app offers an experience similar to using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify from a single browser at the same time.
The unique feature that separates personal data storage space from other technologies is that it allows the user to fully control who can access what information.
The company calls this concept "personal empowerment through data".
According to John Bruce, the company's CEO, the main idea in the creation of the Inrupt company was to bring together the resources, operations, and appropriate skills to help bring Solid to the public use.
The company currently has a security platform acquired by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a community of developers and volunteer coders working on the project on contract.
Starting this week, technology developers from all over the world can develop their own decentralized applications by taking advantage of the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he or his team "didn't discuss with Facebook and Google whether to make a change that would upset all business models overnight."
"We don't ask permission from them," Lee said.
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee explained Inrupt's mission: "Provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help maintain the integrity and quality of the new web system built on the Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee radically changed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been one of the prominent figures in the network neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee, who started Inrupt, will continue to be the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era of the Web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: The priest who took the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only English Church priest to qualify for the Victoria Cross as a combatant in World War I was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann qualified for this engagement in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack on 29 September 1918.
But Vann, who was killed four days later by a sniper, never learned that he was honored with Britain's highest military engagement.
On Saturday, at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two grandchildren of Vann inaugurated the memorial.
Vann's grandson, Michael Vann, stated that the opening of the monument after 100 years of his grandfather's heroism, honored by military engagement, was a "perfect symbol".
On 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann had his battalion "in very foggy weather, under the bullet rain of artillery and machine guns" pass the Saint-Quentin Canal, according to a report in the London Gazette.
Then he quickly ran towards the line of fire, "with great courage" pulling forward the line of fire, and walking alone on top of a field ball, he knocked down three of the platoonmen.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, commented on his grandfather's actions, "a heroism that I know I'll never reach, but also makes you humble."
Michael and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he was "extremely honored to be involved in the parade" and stated that "the courage of a true hero has been proven by the support given by many people."
MMA fans, who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, met Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 and not being given the opportunity to watch the actual event.
The list set in San Jose included 13 fights, six of which were on Main Card and aired live on Channel 5 throughout the night in the United Kingdom.
Viewers in the United Kingdom were shocked when the broadcast suddenly switched to the Peppa Pig cartoon as the Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald match was about to begin at 06:00.
Some viewers who didn't sleep until morning for the fight were not happy about the situation.
One MMA fan described the publication's move to cartoons as a "bad joke" on Twitter.
"The channel had to switch to cartoons because there were government regulations that the content of the publication was not suitable for 6:00 a.m.," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the marketing and communications department of Bellator.
"Yes, 'Peppa the pig' has been published," Schwartz said.
Bellator company president Scott Coker has stated that they will work on timelines so fans in the UK can watch future releases as well.
In a statement regarding the change of publication, Coker said: "I think we can probably reschedule it."
"But now it's Sunday in the UK and it's 6:00 a.m. We can't solve this problem until Monday in our time, Sunday in the UK.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages when the cartoon went on the air, and some of those messages weren't very friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem because we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't a technical error, it was a case of regulations.
I promise next time it won't happen again.
We're going to put in five fights instead of six like we normally do, and we ran into this problem when we were working to offer MMA fans a better one.
It's unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley reveals he feels like a "second-class person" because of his sexual orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley explained that he felt like a second-class person because of his sexual orientation, but that feeling gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he did not realize that "everyone is not like him" until he started middle school.
Daley said in a statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, which was first presented by Lauren Laverne, that the purpose of talking about gay rights was to give "hope" to others.
He also added that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics after becoming a father.
The original host of the long-running radio show, Kirsty Young, was on leave for several months due to his illness.
In this program, where guests thought they were stranded on an island and decided what they wanted to take with them, Daley became Laverne's first guest, stating that he saw himself "down" from everyone when Daley was growing up, because "it is not socially acceptable for a person to have an interest in both boys and girls."
Daley explained: "To date, these feelings of incompetence and feeling of being different from everyone else have given me the strength and stamina to succeed."
He stated that he wanted to prove that he was a "important person" in the past, so that people would not be disappointed when they found out about his sexual orientation.
Having won two bronze Olympic medals, he became a well-known LGBT advocate and called for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality at the Commonwealth Games competitions he participated in this year in Australia.
Daley stated that he felt lucky that he did not face any legal problems because he explained his homosexuality, that he wanted to give "hope" to others, and therefore made his thoughts about the issue clear.
A three-time world champion, he told a man "at a moment he never expected" that he was in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar-winning director, who was 20 years older than him last year, but the athlete notes that the age gap was never a problem.
Daley, who first participated in the Olympics when he was 14 and lost his father to cancer three years later, said it was difficult to find an equal who had experienced similar ups and downs in life "when he got through so much at a young age".
The couple enjoyed the joy of being a parent by adopting a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, Daley said his "whole point of view" changed after he became a father.
The athlete made the following statements about being a parent: "If you had asked that question last year, all I would have been interested in would have been a gold medal."
But there are things worth more than gold medals won at the Olympics.
For me, the Olympic gold medal was Robbie."
Daley's son bears the name of his father Robert, who was diagnosed with brain cancer and died in 2011 at the age of 40.
According to Daley's accounts, his father was unable to accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets to the London 2012 Olympics because he wanted to watch the games from the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't live long enough to watch the games from the first row,'" Daley said.
Daley described his father's experiences at the time of his death: "I was holding his hand as soon as he stopped breathing, I really couldn't accept that he wasn't invincible until he gave his last breath and died."
The Olympic athlete competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics a year after his father's death and won a bronze medal.
"I've known all my life that I've dreamed of this: jumping in front of fans of my own country. There wouldn't be a better feeling than that," Daley said when describing the Olympics.
This also affected his choice of the first song, Daley's choice being Heather Small's Proud, which meant a great deal to him as he was preparing for the Olympic games and still pulsating his feathers.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 according to British Summer Time.
Mickelson, who fell out of form, was removed from the game at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th game in the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he has to regain his form so that this record is not a sad turning point.
Mickelson, who broke the record by participating in the event for the 12th time every two years, was taken out of the game by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourball and four-way (foursome) games.
Mickelson, a five-time major champion, would often be at the center of events on the U.S. team, but spent this Saturday cheering for his team or training on the field in hopes of fixing the problem that caused his performance to drop in the game.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old athlete, whose driver beats are not properly enough, is not an ideal choice for the challenging Le Golf National course, where faulty kicks do not go unpunished in the long run.
As if the track itself wasn't tough enough, Mickelson will compete with British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari won all four of his four matches this week with his inexperienced teammate Tommy Fleetwood.
The American team, four points behind Sunday's 12 singles game, will certainly be of great importance if Mickelson's match can start the game quickly.
Furyk explained that he trusted his teammate, and it was unlikely that he would say anything different.
The U.S. captain used the following statements for his teammate: "Mickelson fully understood his role today, said he would be ready for tomorrow by patting my back and throwing his arm over my shoulder."
"He's very confident.
Mickelson is a player who has signed his name to the Hall of Fame, a name that has added a lot to the teams he has played in the past and to our team this week.
It wasn't in my head to play him in two games.
I thought he was going to play more games, but that's how it had to be, so we decided that we should continue the game.
Of course, Mickelson wants to be on the field like everyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most players in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
For Mickelson, this match could mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which he never fully achieved in his individual records.
According to Furyk, Mickelson gave the team a spiritual advantage with his presence; he won 18 games, lost 20 games, and was tied in seven.
The team captain said of Mickelson: "He has a funny, sarcastic, witty personality, likes to joke around people, a really great friend to spend time in the team room."
I think the younger players were also happy to have had a chance to fight him this week, and it was fun to watch these fights.
He does more than play."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows the big difference could soon be closed.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, saw the final day of the Ryder Cup with prior experience that entering single matches by a large margin could easily turn into an uncomfortable draw.
The Danish player made his debut at Valderrama in 1997, where his team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, was ahead of the Americans by five points, but they won at the end of the match with only a very small nose difference, such as 141 ?2-131 ?2.
After watching the 2018 team win 5-3 at Le Golf National on both Friday and yesterday, with a score of 10-6 at Le Golf National, Bjorn (in the photo), made the following statement: "I keep reminding myself that we were ahead by a big margin in Valderrama, we were ahead by a big margin in Brookline, but we lost in Brookline, and we won by a very small margin in Valderrama."
History reminds me and the players of the opposing team that nothing is over yet.
We'll play with full performance tomorrow.
We'll go out on the field and do everything we have to do.
Nothing is finished until the score is written on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, we're trying to win this trophy, and that should be our whole focus.
I've been saying the same thing from the beginning. My focus is on my 12 players on my team, but we're all aware of who we're fighting on the opposing team. We've got the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players on the challenging golf course, Bjorn said: "I'm never sure of myself in this game.
Tomorrow is a completely different day.
Individual performances will come to the fore tomorrow, and the things we need to do will change.
It's a great feeling to play with your partner if everything's going well, but when you go out on the field alone, you're being tested with all your capacity as a golfer.
This is the message we need to pass on to the players: tomorrow, bring out the best you can.
You need to leave your partner now, and your partner needs to get out on the field and perform best."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, expects his players to perform better than their partner matches individually. This performance increase does not apply to Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four games.
Furyk, who had been on both the losing and winning sides of the matches where the team's fortune changed at the last minute, was on the defeated side in the European team's "Miracle in Medinah" victory when he was on the winning side at Brookline.
Responding to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, a captain in 1999, motivated his players on the last day, Furyk said, "I remember literally what he was saying."
The captain of the American team said, "We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you need to start the game quickly, like in Brookline or Medinah.
Once momentum is on your side, there is a big task for the players of the midfield games.
So we did our ranking accordingly, and we brought out the players that we believe have a high performance, and you know, we're going to try to create a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas took on the task of leading the counteroffensive and will face Rory McIlroy in the first game, while the other players of the first half on the European team's list are: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"I chose to play the players I chose in this order because I think this order is suitable for all matches from start to finish," Bjorn said regarding the players he selected for single matches.
Germany's new warship has been delayed once again to enter service
The new frigate of the German Navy would replace warships from the Cold War era, starting service in 2014, but the frigate will not be available until next year due to malfunctioning systems and increased cost, according to local media reports.
A military source told Die Zeit newspaper that the launch date of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates' flagship "Rheinland-Pfalz" was postponed to the first half of 2019 for now.
The ship was supposed to join the German Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery did not stop the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the German Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
The ships will have stealth (invisible ship) technologies such as low-frequency radar, infrared and acoustic signatures, as well as a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, it was stated.
Other important features of the ship include longer maintenance intervals, with new frigates expected to be able to serve up to two years away from the port of docking.
But, according to Die Zeit, the state-of-the-art warships said to enable Germany to deploy its forces overseas will already be obsolete by the time they enter service.
The F125 frigate, unable to survive the misfortunes, was headlined last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
The Navy returned the ship, which was delivered with this incident for the first time, to the ship's manufacturer.
The reasons for the extradition were not detailed, however, according to German media reports, there were a number of critical "software and hardware errors" that would render the ship useless if the ship was taken on a combat mission.
Software errors are of particular importance as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be used by 120 shipmen, which corresponds to half the number of personnel employed in former Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship was too heavy, lowering performance and restricting the possibility of Navy personnel making changes to the ship in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" was said to weigh twice as much as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the staff, has become a problem.
The project price allegedly increased from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros (US$3.6).
With warnings that Germany's power at sea is declining, the problems that arise in new frigates are gaining importance.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that "suicide-appropriate ships" belonging to the German Navy had been "reduced".
The head of the defence committee said the problem grew over time due to the failure of new ships to replace them, although the old ships were decommissioned.
The president expressed regret that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates were eligible to join the Navy.
National Trust association overhears bats' secret lives
A new study is being conducted in a field in Highlands, Scotland, to figure out how bats benefited from the terrain during hunting.
It is hoped that the findings from the study will shed light on the behavior of bats, the only mammal to fly, and guide future conservation work.
The study, carried out by scientists at Scotland's National Trust for Scotland association, will follow the common dwarf bats and Mediterranean dwarf bats found at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared bats and Daubenton bats.
During the season, special recording devices will be placed at key points of the terrain to track the activities of bats.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile work using hand-held detectors.
Once all the recordings have been performed by experts, the frequencies of bat sounds will be determined to determine which species is doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be prepared to create a detailed picture of the behavior of bats across the land.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are more important to bats, and how these areas are used by each species of bat.
This information will benefit habitat management studies, such as grassland creation, as well as help determine how best wooded areas can be protected for bats and related species.
In the past century, there has been a significant decrease in bat population in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom.
Bats are threatened by building and building jobs that affect their perch and cause them to lose their habitat.
Other factors that pose a risk to bats include wind turbines, lighting tools, flyflies, chemical processes used in some building materials, and home cats' attacks.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey because of their hunting habits at night.
Bats are using an advanced echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles in their flight paths.
The NTS, responsible for the protection of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, places great emphasis on bats.
The association employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, perch reviews, and sometimes rescue activities on the subject.
The organization established Scotland's first and only bat-specific shelter on the Threave land of Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten different bat species.
David Thompson, the land manager, stated that the land was an ideal area for bats.
"We have a great space for bats in Threeave," Thompson said.
Land manager Thompson said: "We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and a nice living space.
But we still don't know much about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us understand what bats need to thrive."
Thompson underscores the need to check if there are bats in buildings before they begin maintenance work, an accidental destruction of a single mother's perch could cause the death of close to 400 females and young bats, leading to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals that are forbidden to kill, disturb or harm or destroy their perch.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust association, invited people to contribute to the project.
"We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know what the populations of many species living in our region are like," Ferrell said in a statement.
Ronaldo's lawyers, who reject rape claims, prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations "fake news" and suggested that people were trying to "make their own introductions" using the name Ronaldo.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Ronaldo, a forward for the Portuguese national team and Juventus, was alleged to have raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that Ronaldo later paid the woman $375,000 to avoid talking about the incident.
Ronaldo, 33, told 142 million followers on his Instagram live feed hours after the allegations had been mediated, saying the allegations were "false news".
The five-time winner of the Golden Ball (Ballon d'Or) award told the camera, "No, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news."
"They want to make their own ads using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, I don't have a problem," he added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they consider "unacceptably reporting suspicions in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "spiritual damage that corresponds to the magnitude of this violation, perhaps one of the most serious personal rights violations seen in recent years".
The incident allegedly took place in a room at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the football player's room after meeting at a nightclub, where Ronaldo allegedly raped Mayorga.
Mayorga argues that Ronaldo kneeled down after the alleged incident and told him that he was a "good man" at a rate of "99 percent" and that "one percent" had been betrayed.
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the two were having sexual intercourse, but that was within the consent of the two parties.
Mayorga argues that he went to the police and later agreed to extrajudicial settlement because he was "afraid of revenge" and "afraid of being humiliated in front of society".
Mayorga, 34, says he is looking for ways to break a compromise, as his trauma from the alleged incident is still under way.
Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to Italian giant Juventus for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will "always regret" losing automakers
Trade Minister Greg Clark said Britain would "always regret" losing its position as world leader in automotive production after Brexit.
Toyota added that it was "concerning" that Britain would report to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily take a break from production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We have to make a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car company said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, prolonged waiting time at the border could cause people to lose their jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, had produced 150,000 vehicles, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union last year.
"My opinion is that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota's Burnaston plant.
Automakers such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have also raised fears that it will leave the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini facility in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The main concerns are based on what automakers refer to as risks in the supply chain if Brexit takes place without a deal.
The Toyota production line works with the "just in time" principle, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK withdraws from the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a disruption in customs. According to industry, this could lead to disruption, delays and failure to supply parts.
The firm said it was impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's inventory at its Derbyshire facility, so production would stop.
In terms of Theresa May's future relations with the EU, Clark said the Chequers plan was "clearly set to prevent these controls at the border".
"We need to make a deal. As I said, we want to make the best deal that will allow us to get this opportunity, not just a deal that will lead us to success for now," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
"According to evidence from not only Toyota but also from other manufacturers, we should be able to maintain our extremely successful supply chains."
Toyota was unable to determine how long production would last, but warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the facility's competitiveness and ultimately leave people unemployed.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston for 24 years and was the organization's Unite unit meeting organizer, said his members were increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, these things never come back when they disappear.
A government spokesman said: "We need to come up with a clear and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
White House: Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's big meeting with Deputy Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week" as the debate over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continued.
Rosenstein directs Russia's election intervention, links between Trump's aides and Russia, and the work of special-authority prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the possibility of the president obstructing justice.
The issue of whether Trump would lay off his deputy minister by jeopardizing Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a wire and dismissing the president with the 25th amendment to record his conversations with Trump.
Rosenstein denied the news.
However, he went to the White House last Monday amid allegations that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting would be held on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations at the time in New York.
Trump said he had "chosen" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed so that it would not coincide with the Senate Justice Commission hearing between Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the two women who accused him of sexual abuse and whose testimony was appealed.
On Friday, Trump again delayed the Senate's full vote by ordering the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said, "A date has not been set for this, it could be this week, but it is also possible that it could be postponed for another week, given everything else in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'd always like to keep the press informed of the developments," he said.
Some reporters object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press briefing in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the show's host, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not because TV reporters "played the stands", but added: "But I can't deny that they played the stands."
Sanders later suggested that direct contact with Trump and the press would increase.
"Trump holds more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president," he said, adding without funding, "We've studied the numerical data."
Sanders said, "The briefings will continue, but it would be much better if the press had a chance to direct their questions about the United States to the president than if they spoke to me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, and in the last few weeks you've seen us do it many times, and when you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it's going to replace the press briefing," he said.
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with high-ranking visitors.
Solo press conferences don't happen often.
The president has shown perhaps why by over-free-talking in front of reporters gathered in New York this week and occasionally giving strange images.
Health Minister writes letter to EU employees in Scotland NHS about concerns over Brexit
The Minister of Health sent letters to EU employees at the National Health Service of Scotland (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and ask them to continue working in the period after Brexit.
Scottish Parliament Member Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government had already promised to take the expense of finalised location applications for EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "The negotiations on the withdrawal between the UK and the EU lasted through the summer, and this fall opened the way for the expected decisions to be made.
But the British Government also stepped up preparations in case there was no agreement.
I realize this is a very distressing time for all of you.
So I wanted to once again express how much I value the contributions of every member of our staff, no matter what nation they are from.
While strengthening and improving health care work, our colleagues in the EU and abroad are also offering valuable experience and skills that benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we would love for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie, injured in head, was rushed into surgery.
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie was rushed into surgery on Saturday after his head was injured in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in Tennessean.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"She came to the edge of the field and collapsed where she was," Reed said.
After the trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen by the field, they put the football player on a stretcher and took him to a detailed examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had gone through surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet about the type/degree of injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who was in his sophomore year at college, transferred from Illinois and had his sophomore season at Tennessee State.
He played five balls in total before leaving Saturday's game, raising the number of steals in the season to 18.
Higher stamp tax to be levied on foreigners buying real estate in the UK
UK real estate buyers will receive higher stamp tax than foreigners, and that surplus will be used for homeless people within the new Tory plans.
This move will incapacitate Corbyn's success in his effort to attract young voters.
The pricey stamp tax will be taken from those who do not tax in the UK.
Ministry of Finance predicts 120 million pounds will be collected annually to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that more stamp taxes will be levied on foreign buyers when buying real estate in the UK, to be used to help the homeless.
This move is seen as Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to override the success of his effort to provide more affordable homes by targeting high-income buyers.
The stamp tax hike will be obtained in the UK from non-taxers and firms, which will contribute to the Government's effort to fight homelessness.
Two years ago, this fee, which adds to the current stamp tax, could be three percent, to include high taxes on second houses and foreign-owned real estate.
The Ministry of Finance predicts that this initiative will yield up to 120 million pounds a year.
In London, it is estimated that 13 percent of the new generation of real estate was bought by people outside the UK, making it difficult for first-time real estate buyers to handle by raising prices.
Due to foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country, many wealthy areas in the country, especially those in the capital, have become "ghost cities".
The new policy came up a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax reduction so that more young people could get their first home.
Johnson accused large construction firms of putting early on land and then raising real estate prices by not using them, and invited May to remove quotas in affordable homes to remove this "real estate disgrace" in the UK.
Corbyn announced a series of remarkable housing reform proposals, including rent inspections, aimed at ending evictions that "do not stand the ground".
He also wants more powers to the councils to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to reviving the British dream, that is, making life even better for all future generations.
This requires correcting our deteriorating housing market.
Britain will always be open to people to live, work and build lives here.
However, it cannot be true that people who do not live in the UK and firms of foreign origin can buy houses here as easily as hardworking British citizens.
Having a home has been a very difficult dream for a lot of people, and a humiliating situation like homelessness is too real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to be Scotland's director"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "biggest goal" was to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish director enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, three points behind the top in League One.
He moved to Light Stadium this summer after taking St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound, "I wanted to play football in my country.
I just bought a baseball cap, that's all," he said.
"But when I was a child, I grew up in Hampden with my father watching Scotland, which has always attracted me.
But this opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in coaching."
Sunderland's managers before Ross include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
In the past, the former manager of Alloa Athletic, who had rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, said that he had no qualms about working after long-established names in such a large club.
"For me, success at the moment is only measured by the answer to the question 'Can I return this club to the Premier League?'"
Judging by the structure and possibilities at the club, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get out there, but the only way I can count myself successful here is probably to get the club there."
Ross, who was a one-time assistant coach at Dumbarton and served 15 months on Hearts' coaching staff, is only in his third year of coaching career.
Ross also saved Alloa from a clump and placed him in third place in the league, turning St. Mirren from the brink of a clump and raising him to a higher clump the following season, earning him the title of Champion.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real turning point," he said about the time Alloa was in charge.
"I really believe that coaching is the right choice for me, rather than playing football.
It may sound strange because I play well, earn reasonable sums, and have good times.
But playing can be challenging.
There are many stages that you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through the same things in terms of work stress and pressure, but coaching makes me feel really good.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and I'm doing that right now, and I've been feeling most comfortable my entire adult life.

The study found that the best time for beer was 17:30.
In the summer, scorching temperatures increased the revenue of Britain's distressed bars, while the chain put more pressure on restaurants.
According to numerical data, sales of pub and bar groups rose by 2.7 percent in July, while revenues from restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA financial advisor who collected the numeric data, said: "Continuous sunlight and England's long-term competition at the World Cup meant that the pub revenues of July increased by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants were moving in a manner similar to June, where they suffered a deep blow.
In June, the 1.8 percent decline in the business volume of restaurants became even worse in July.
The liquor-heavy pubs and bars performed best in the open, earning more than the revenue lost by restaurants with their likes.
Food-heavy pubs were also damaged by the heat, although not as serious as restaurant operators.
It seems like people are just going out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars processed, food sales fell by three percent this month, while liquor sales increased by 6.6 percent."
Paul Newman, RSM entertainment and accommodation analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of significant social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales in the off-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer despite the fact that in addition to the cost pressures of the 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year, it is particularly tedious.
The long and hot summer has come to the worst possible time for food-intensive businesses, and time will tell whether the warmer weather we saw in August will provide some of the relief needed."
The total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, a reflection of the slowdown in brand output.

One in five children have a social media account that they keep secret from their parents.
One study found that one in five children who start at age 11 have social media accounts that they keep secret from their parents and teachers.
Research among 20,000 middle school students revealed a plus in their "false Insta" accounts
This development has raised concerns that there have been sexually explicit posts
Twenty percent of students said they had a "mother" account to show their parents.
One in every child, starting at age 11, opens secret social media accounts from their adult.
Research among 20,000 middle school students, Instagram, a "false Insta," photo-sharing site, revealed the increase in their accounts.
This development raised concerns that there had been sexual content sharing.
Twenty percent of the students said they had clean "mother" accounts as well as a special account for showing their parents.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account came across a teenager who forced others to "rape" her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools revealed that 40 percent of students aged between 11 and 18 had two accounts, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that so many young people tend to create Internet spaces where their families and teachers can't find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected as an independent member of the community's board of directors at the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics.
Doyle, Scotland's most equipped athlete and president, Ian Beattie, considered this development a great opportunity for those who steered the sport to benefit from the athlete's ten-year experience at the international level.
"Eilidh is highly respected in Scotland, Great Britain and the world athletic community, and bringing it to the board will greatly contribute to Scottish athletics," Beattie said.
"I'm ready to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can contribute and steer the Scottish sport," Doyle said.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m races at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, won four gold medals in total, and is now an expert at the BBC, was unable to walk after his temporary ischemic attack.
"A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me whether I would recover, how much I would recover if I did.
It's been a tough process, but I've completely recovered, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm practicing agility!
Thank you for your support messages!"
Breast pump ad that makes mothers look like cows split the internet in two
The breast pump company, which likens nursing mothers to cows being milked, split the internet in two with its advertising.
Consumer technologies firm Elvie has released a humorous advertisement inspired by a clip to promote its product, which is said to be "the world's first wearable silent breast pump", to demonstrate the freedom the new pump recognizes to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cow barn with a song whose lyrics are as follows: "Yes, I milk my own milk but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't notice, these aren't cow tits, they're my tits."
The chorus of the song reads: "Pompala, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk."
However, the advertising shared on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and has been commented on hundreds of times, has received mixed reactions from viewers. Many people have said that the video reveals the "dangers" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows in advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to reproduce, but their offspring are taken away a few days after they are born," he wrote.

Someone else wrote the comment: "It's obviously traumatic for both the mother and her offspring.
But why shouldn't they be used in breast pump advertising for mothers whose babies aren't taken away?
Another wrote: "A very detached advertisement from the world."
Others defended the ad, a woman said she found the song "very funny".
One said, "I think it's a very creative idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd get it from this pump.
Pumping milk really made me feel like a cow.
It's a bit of a flyer, but I got the message.
It's a very clever product," he wrote.
Another said, "This is mostly an advertisement for mothers who feel like cows when they pump milk at work or in toilets."
It's not an ad that praises or destroys the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, all the women show dancing with a breast pump attached to their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cable, tubes, and fits right into the lactation bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, or even go out while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, a co-creator and creative executive at Mother, said, "Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and provocative introduction.
We wanted to build a similarity between nursing mothers and milking cows, to pump milk while showing the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump would provide in a fun and understanding way, and to take out all the challenges of this process in daylight.
This is not the first time Elvie Pump has been on the agenda.
At London Fashion Week, a mother with two children took to the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
Although monthly border crossings have not changed much, the number of illegal child migrants has risen rapidly, partly due to the Trump administration's strict speech and policies to make it difficult to place children next to their sponsors.
Usually, sponsors are people who are illegal immigrants themselves at the time and are afraid of endangering their ability to stay in the country by adopting children.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and adults at home had to fingerprint and that the data would be shared with immigration officials.
Senior Immigration and Customs Protection officer Matthew Albence testified that the agency against Congress arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor underage children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or are family of sponsors are in this country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we're not going to let these people go."
Asylum workers have introduced new rules that require officers to appear in court within a month instead of the standard 60 days after they are arrested in order to see the children's case faster.
Instead of going to court in person, many will defend the conference call and the immigration judge in their case about their legal status.
Those who are not eligible for release will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the more children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety disorder and depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape.
Lawyers said these concerns increased at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the child's symptoms of being in distress are more likely to be ignored, depending on the size.
They also stated that sending children to a tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could trigger the traumas that many of them already suffer.
Syria says American, French and Turkish "invasionist forces" should withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al Muallim called for Syrian refugees to return as well, although the war in the country was in its eighth year.
Muallim, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were found illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "what is needed will be done about it".
"They must withdraw immediately, unconditionally," he told the board.
Muallim claimed that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more are homeless.
He said Damascus "will continue this holy struggle until it clears both terrorist groups and all illegal foreign entities from all the lands in Syria."
The United States has close to 2,000 military units in Syria that train against Bashar Assad with Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs and provide intelligence to these troops.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, he said, the conditions were favourable for them to return, and he accused "some western countries" of "spreading out uninhabited fears" that led to refugees staying out of the country.
"We have called on international communities and humanitarian organizations to ensure returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be just a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that development assistance will not be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats told Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold between Russia and Turkey, that the agreement to create a buffer zone created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russia-Turkey agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region of three million people.
However, Muallim stressed that the agreement had "net deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action targeting jihadists, including fighters on the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, would be "removed".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura wants to organize the first meetings of a new board of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
He proposed conditions for the Syrian government to join the committee and warned against interventions, saying that the function of the panel should be limited to "examining the articles of the current constitution".
Why Trump Will Win the Election for the Second Time
According to this logic, Trump will win the new election in 2020 if it does not lead to liberal audiences possibly abusing the post as he hoped and an early end to the scandal presidency.
This would undoubtedly be the "most dramatic end of all time for the president!"
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
In gold watches since 2014, CNN's ratings doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's ratings tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average audience of 2.4 million four years ago in its golden hours, with 3.5 million viewers on cable on MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" main news nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the show's head of ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which describes a minister who was president after the Capitol building was destroyed by an attack.
Experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" Nell Scovell has another theory.
He remembers an incident in a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told Scovell he was going to give the vote to Trump.
The author asked, "Why?"
"Because it makes me laugh," the driver said.
There's entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, plots from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be reunited, and the state of the global economy.
Staying away from the agenda is a luxury that only very privileged audiences have the power to afford.
However, the experts' use of "detailed information" as a method of showing resources in Bob Woodward's "Fear" book on the panel goes beyond being a citizen watching Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin bomber jacket (a kind of clothes covered in vanity according to the Washington Post's definition) and Stormy Daniels' discussion of Trump's, well, his anatomy, for six hours.
I personally can't look at Super Mario the same way again.
"What makes the program look like a reality show is that it gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, general manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about the changing team of Trump's program and the issues that change every day (getting into a fight with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un...).
You don't have the luxury of missing a chapter, or you'll be left behind.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 80 degrees outside Kauai's north coast house, but it was closed to that house, while MSNBC was watching it, recording CNN.
Brett Kavanaugh was unable to control himself while facing the Senate Justice Commission and the fate of the Supreme Court was in doubt.
Fleiss told me, "I remember people saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' when we used to do all those crazy programs."
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Foreign money flows into the most difficult midterm election the White House has ever participated in.
It is not surprising that he saw cash flow in Pennsylvania's 17th district as a result of a vote shift that put the two officials in Congressional districts in the race for the same position.
The newly held Pittsburgh suburban district is putting Democratic MP Conor Lamb in the race, who participated in the election last spring in another district.
Lamb is competing against another island, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents his 12th district, which largely overlaps with Pennsylvania's new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn in January, as the Supreme Court ruled that the former territories were set in the interests of the Republicans in violation of the constitution.
The race in the new 17th district was the scene of an election campaign funding race that broke the main party funding branches between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name after winning the special election for Pennsylvania's 18th District in March, followed by many others.
There had been a Republican in this post for more than a decade, and President Trump had won the region by 20 points.
Political experts provoked the Democrats a bit.
U.S. Considers Punishing El Salvador over Support for China, Then Gives Up
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already known Beijing, with some reaction from Washington as well.
Trump held an intimate meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization's administrative team.
In a statement earlier this month, State Department Spokesman Heather Nauert said that the ministry officials had decided to recall U.S. officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, who were on a diplomatic mission because of "the decision to no longer recognize Taiwan, which had just been taken".
But the sanctions were only intended to be imposed on El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017 for the purpose of narcotic control, development and economic support.
Sanctions covering financial aid cuts and targeting visa restrictions would be devastating for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As meetings continued in the ministry, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference on security and economic development, which was a continuation of a similar meeting last year and seen as an improvement in efforts to prevent migrants from turning to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior executives said they wanted the conference to move forward, and they did not leave any sanctions bill for El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to speak at the mid-October conference as an indication of the administration's importance to the meeting.
Three American representatives returned calmly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without bringing harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
For Bolton, the White House Spokesperson refused to comment on the details of the debate, described by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats and agreed to conduct internal negotiations on the condition of confidentiality.
The statements of these officials were supported by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and spoke on the condition of secrecy.
Learn History
Another expected development could be that special-appointed prosecutor Robert Mueller wrote a report on the possibility that Trump would block justice with fairly supportive evidence in the archives.
Mueller was reportedly to direct his research into whether Trump's election campaign was linked to Russia's attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will once again find himself forced to answer in this community as a jury of his colleagues prepares to appear before the electorate.
There are many possibilities, and I don't claim that Trump or his peers in Europe are inevitable.
There are choices to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic to determine how long the struggle will take.
If the West had resisted Hitler in 1938 and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich, the German officers would have been ready to take a hit.
We have failed and we have not been able to prevent years of massacres.
History is shaped around such turning points, and the unstoppable progress of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans currently live with a few of these milestones.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has faced serious problems since the document emerged last year, claiming that he had secretly suggested recording the president's talks and had raised rumors that the president was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times' statements are not true.
"How do we respond if the recently requested Brett Kavanaugh investigation from the FBI is not conducted comprehensively and fairly, or found not guilty in the Supreme Court, although there are serious charges against sexual assault and perjury?
All of this aside, in the midterm elections, are we going to vote for a House that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these exams, democracy will go through a difficult process.
But I don't believe we're going to fail, because I learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime who once occupied my embassy home.
He survived, emigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the sabbath candles on that table with a swastika on it.
How can I be desperate about our future when I have such a past?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers hopeful after Rapid Vienna collision
Following their impressive draw with Villarreal earlier this month in Spain, Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on this Thursday field and will have a strong advantage to advance to a top round from the European League's Group G if they leave their match with the Austrian team with a win.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to take part in the field during the season due to injury to the knee, until the match with Villarreal, which ended 2-2, but according to the player, this could be used as a jumpboard for larger jobs for the team.
"For us this was a good score because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went to the game believing we could get a good result and we left with one point.
Maybe we could have had a better result, but the tie was probably a fairer one.
In the first half they were probably better than us, but in the second half we came forward and played better.
It's coming up on Thursday and it's going to be another big European night.
We hope we get three more points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they got a good result from their last game, but, with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can push them and get a positive result.
With my injuries and the changes the club went through, last year has been really hard, but I think our current position is very good.
Our team is good and everyone is really enjoying it; the workouts are going well.
I hope we continue this way and put the last season behind us and we will succeed."
Women sleep deprived of fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the study had clear ideas of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to their parents about it.
Almost half of the individuals under Nationwide's research said they talked to their wives about long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking any steps to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
You can start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don't tell them what you want, you can't prepare your family for how they will look after you in the future.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can also offer you a solution to cover these costs.
A traditional long-term care insurance policy may be among your payment options for long-term care, as long as you have a mixed cash-for-semester life insurance policy or money to help you cover expenses.
Complete transactions with legal documents: Solve legal problems from the beginning.
Prepare a health proxy, so that you have chosen someone you trust to manage your health care and ensure that employees comply with your wishes when you are unable to communicate.
Also, try to establish a proxy that will do your financial management.
You also want to make sure that your financial decisions are made by someone you trust and that your bills are paid in cases where it is not possible for you to.
Remember small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions you have been asked about this person in regards to medication and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan so that you are ready for anything.
"It's not just financial matters, but who will be the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What treatment will be followed?
Who will take care of the dog?

A man at Ilfracombe opened fire with an air rifle.
Several shots were fired at a man walking from the outside to his house during the night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Police said the incident, which took place at 2:30 a.m. with British Summer Time, was a "random act".
The victim said she didn't see the attacker.
There is no fatal injury, and police are collecting testimony from witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis occurred in Indonesia
Officials said on Friday that at least 384 people were killed in the Indonesian city of Palu due to a severe earthquake and tsunami, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communication channels, aid workers have not yet received any news of the regency of Donggala, north of Palu, the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, and is estimated to have a population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that spans more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regent, an administrative district located under a province, is estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main livelihoods of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the economy of the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining in the province is also important, but mining is concentrated in Morowali on the opposite bank of Sulawesi.
In the past 100 years, there have been several tsunamis in Palu and Donggala, according to the Indonesian Disaster Enforcement Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes while killing more than 200 people in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami killed nine people in Donggala.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is experiencing earthquakes on a regular basis.
Here are some serious earthquake and tsunami disasters in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, created a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: Severe earthquakes in late March and early April hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami, causing the island to hit the south coast and killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra hit one of the Mentawai islands, causing a tsunami approaching 10 metres, and dozens of villages were destroyed as a result of the disaster, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake in Aceh's Pidie Jaya regency brings to mind the deadly damage of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami, causing destruction and panic.
This time, a tsunami was not triggered, but more than 100 people were killed due to the destroyed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes on Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok have killed 500 people, most of whom are located north of the island.
The earthquake caused thousands of buildings to collapse and thousands of tourists were stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
The eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Track Palin was arrested on assault charges.
According to a report by the Alaska State Police on Saturday, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, interfering with a report on domestic violence, and resisting police.
According to the police report, he took away the phone of a woman who tried to call the police in order to report the aforementioned charges.
According to the KTUU statement, Palin is currently being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with an unsecured bond of $500.
According to the statement, he was "absolutely innocent" when he was asked to plead in court on Saturday.
Palin faces three different Class A charges of misdemeanor, which could result in up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
There is also a Class B charge against him, which could result in one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not Palin's first criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, had called the police to report the alleged attack.
The Supreme Court of Alaska is currently handling the case.
In January 2016, he faced charges of domestic violence, interfering with a report on domestic violence, and possession of weapons while under substance influence in connection with the same incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched Palin in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 for tying her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his services in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami, resulting in thousands of homes being destroyed.
Electricity and communication channels are currently unavailable, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia.
Videos showing the moment of disaster are shared in social media circles.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a coastal festival in the city of Palu.

Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in a terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York City, which has rarely been imposed for any federal crime in the city since 1953.
Saipov, reportedly 30, rented a truck from Home Depot in October to carry out an attack on a bicycle road on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway, and ran over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the intent document reported in the Southern District of New York, which states that the death penalty was requested, prosecutors need to prove that Saipov "wittedly" killed eight victims and "wittedly" inflicted serious physical damage on people in order to justify the death penalty.
According to court documents, both of these crimes lead to a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a major federal jury slapped Saipov with a 22-point indictment involving a violent charge, a charge of the destruction of motor vehicles, and an eight-murder charge for blackmail, which is often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime.
Prosecutors said "large-scale pre-planning" was necessary for the attack, saying Saipov's action was "sick, cruel, immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injury and damage; Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco's family and friends were strangled by the law," the report writes.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York was last sentenced to death ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug suppliers, but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In a federal case in New York, the last time Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to death was in 1953, when the married couple were accused of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier, and they were executed.
The Rosenberg couple were put in an electric chair and executed on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov of Uzbekistan showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police testimony, he told investigators that he felt good about what he was doing.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired by an ISIS video he watched on his phone to carry out the attack.
According to police testimony, he even wanted to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He said he did not plead guilty to the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, a federal defense official representing Saipov, said the decision was "sad, of course".
"We think that the decision to be sentenced to death rather than sentenced to life without the defendant being released would further extend the trauma for all of the people involved in the incident," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek capital punishment.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" during a Tory conference today.
Theresa May, one of her own MPs, said she should head talks with the EU, while the former Ukip leader said politicians should feel pressure from opponents of the European Union.
Conservative opposition MP Peter Bone said in a march in Birmingham that if Mr Farage had not been Brexit Secretary, the United Kingdom would "be out by now".
It was underlined by pro-Torys in the EU, who participated in another anti-Brexit march in the city, that Mrs May had trouble reconciling her dissociated party members.
The prime minister is having problems with ensuring that his party continues the plan between Brexit supporters, EU supporters and attacks from the EU itself.
Its allies insist that it continue its effort to reach a deal with Brussels despite the incoming reactions and force the Labour Party to choose between the proposed plan and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone said he wanted to "empty the Chequers Residence" during the Leave Means Leave march at Solihull.
Mr Farage said he should be an interlocutor in talks with Brussels and take responsibility.
"If he was in charge of these talks, we would have left the EU by now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will make an effort for Brexit, but we need to evacuate the Chequers."
He expressed his opposition to the EU: "We did not give the world wars to become a servant.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone denied allegations that the public opinion had changed following the 2016 vote: "The notions that the British people's opinion has changed and that they want to stay in the EU are completely unfounded."
Pro-Brexit and Andrea Jenkyns of Tory were also on the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Mr. Prime Minister, listen to the people."
"Chequers are not liked by the public, the opposition will not get the vote, they are not liked by our party and our activists who have allowed us to be taken to the streets and elected.
Please let Chequers go and open your ears."
He added to his message targeting Mrs. May: "The prime ministers cannot hold their positions if they do not keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said in the march that politicians should "feel the pressure" on them when they consider betraying the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people and the politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say, 'We're not going to let you do this.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to feel the pressure on our politicians on the verge of betraying Brexit."
"We are trying to mobilize the people's army of this country, which allows us to triumph in Brexit, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU held a two-hour rally in downtown Birmingham following their march within the city of Birmingham.
After the group's entry this weekend, a group of activists waved "Torys vs Brexit" flags.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, criticized the Conservatives for their patronisation of a party practice as the conference opened.
"These are people who tell us that they can use IT systems and all technologies for smooth borders for Canada and unlimited free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a disgrace.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans a "deep review" of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she planned to "take an in-depth look at running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party was talking about his future plans in a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will compete in the November election against Republican Party State Representative Geoff Diehl, co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There were rumors that Warren might run against Trump in 2020.
The event, held Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, was Warren's 36th meeting with participating voters in the city hall setting since Trump took office.
One participant asked him if he was running for president.
Warren responded that "it's time for women to go to Washington to fix the broken government, and that includes a woman at the top of the state."
One person from LSU was arrested for the shooting and murder of Sims.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference at 11:00 Eastern Time that 20-year-old Dyson Simpson had been arrested in connection with the incident.
Police, who posted a video of the shooting on Friday, sought the help of citizens to identify a man involved in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead early Friday near the campus of South University.
"Wayde Sims appears to have been shot dead in the head," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press, according to 247sports on Saturday.
It was reported that Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson admitted to being found at the scene in his interrogation, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in the East Baton Rouge Neighborhood Police Department.
Raised in Baton Rouge and a 6 fut 6-inch boy, Sims averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds in a total of 32 games in the top 5 of last season 10.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world championship after leaving Sebastian Vettel behind on team's orders
From the moment Valtteri Bottas stepped in front of Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's race, it was revealed that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start from pole position, maintaining his position in the first two rounds, forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel, who entered the pit stop first, then left Hamilton behind, which could have been the move that ended the race.
The Mercedes team that entered the pit stop in the next round came behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a close-knit double move that forced the Ferrari driver to defend in the third round, allowing him to leave the interior unintentionally.
Max Verstappen, who started the race in the back row and celebrated his 21st birthday, finished seventh at the end of the first round.
He then led much of the race at the expense of burning his tires to beat the fourth-placed Kimi Raikkonen, aiming to finish quickly.
Verstappen entered the pit stop in lap 44, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen did not lose the fourth.
"It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job of getting the first two places," he said.
Body Language Was Really Bad
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who said at Saturday's rally that Christine Blasey Ford had not leaked a letter accusing Constitutional Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said that people were seen as "bad and lying" because of what was going on in the Senate.
"The only thing that can happen and the nice thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days is that we see angry, angry, bad and dishonest people," Trump said.
You look at the information that was published and leaked, but they said, "I didn't do it.
It wasn't me," he says.
"Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak information?
And don't forget the woman's answer, did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it," he says.
Wait a minute.
Did we leak it? We didn't leak it," Trump impersonated the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford in July detailing allegations of sexual harassment to Kavanaugh, the letter had been leaked to the press in September, but Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his own office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations and I didn't leak his story," The Hill reported to the committee.
"Dr. Fort asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret as he asked."
Yet this denial, judging by what he said at the Saturday night rally, did not satisfy the president: "Look what I'm going to tell you. Body language was really bad.
Maybe it didn't leak, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to try anything to regain power."
"You see how they do evil to gain power and control, they don't care who they hurt and who they crush," Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two of Giants' goals against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars won a 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday, compensating for Friday's Elite League defeat.
Giants scored two zeros at the start of the match with goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie moved the home team to a draw, but Dwyer's goal put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee again, but Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals determined the outcome of the match.
The match in Belfast was the third Elite League defeat of the season for the students of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 by passing again after his defeat on Friday.
This was the two teams' fourth match this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came from Kendall McFaull's assist in the fourth minute of the match at 03:35, four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assist, Beauvillier pulling the difference in half.
During the busy first period, Sullivan scored a home team goal at 13:10, followed by Matt Marquardt scoring a goal at 15:16 that equaled Cownie's score.
Dwyer scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period, allowing the Giants to lead the circuit.
The home team gathered itself and once again tied the score for Bouchard's goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to make Nielsen take the lead against Dundee for the first time at the end of the second period and scored the final goal in the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, will host Milton Keynes on their field next Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Make Hundreds of Passengers on Plane Escape Earthquake
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller is referred to as a hero after a plane carrying hundreds of people lost its life while safely getting off the track.
More than 800 people were killed in a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which then triggered a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks continue in the area, and a lot of people in the city of Palu are still waiting to be rescued under the rubble.
Although his colleagues fled to save their own lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower of the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Palu.
He stayed in the tower to make sure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, was safely airborne.
He then jumped off the tower, thinking that the traffic control tower had collapsed.
He later died in the hospital where he was removed.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller's decision may have saved hundreds of people's lives.
"We have prepared a helicopter to transport our colleague from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city."
"But unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu."
"We are very saddened to hear this news," Sirait added.
On the other hand, the country's disaster-fighting agency, Donggala, has stated that access to the towns of Sigi and Boutong is limited, with officials worried that the death toll could rise to thousands.
"We think the death toll may increase because there are still many people under the rubble," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are taking medical assistance and supplies to the area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in new bodies.
Clean water is very difficult to find.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, President of the International Red Cross Indonesia, told CNN: "As the Indonesian Red Cross, we're racing through time to help those who survive, but we don't know what we're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday to report to CNN and said to the military, "I want you to work day and night to complete all missions related to the evacuation.
Are you ready to do that?"
Indonesia was also hit by earthquakes earlier this year, killing more than 550 people in Lombok.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports a man missing after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, announced that 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking aircraft, but one person was missing.
Air Niugini said a male passenger could not be found as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find this passenger.
The airline has not yet responded to further information about the passenger, such as the passenger's age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew on the plane that crashed while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said seven people were hospitalized on Friday.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were kept in the hospital under observation and their condition was stable.
The cause of the accident and how it unfolded in turn remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses claimed that the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane approached the runway too low.
Jaynes added, "That's an extremely good thing."
Jaynes said that he and others managed to make their way to the emergency exits of the plane that sank into the water at the waistline.
He said flight attendants panicked and yelled and suffered a minor injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to improve a nearby pier were helping rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 fut).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have been killed in accidents in PNG-registered airlines over the past 20 years, but Air Niugini has no history of an accident.
The analyst revealed the flow of time into the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution presented their evidence on Saturday at a trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, the U.S. Department of Justice Analyst, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
The analyst told the jury how the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers put together their actions the night she died.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that he had obtained location information from his mobile phones to indicate that Tellis was with Chambers the night of the woman's death.
The police went to talk to Sanford when the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers' when Tellis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford.
Sanford appeared on the court bench on Saturday, testifying that he was not in town that day.
"The defendant is lying because my truck was in Nashville," Sanford continued when prosecutors recalled Tellis' statement that he was in Sanford's truck that night.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known her for about two weeks when Chambers died.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defendant's closing defenses are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said the case was expected to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
This hip hop trio wants to change the genre's negative perception by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from the origin of political messages and is dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently became popular again in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York nanny sues for double "racist" message she works with
A New York nanny is suing the couple for discrimination and dismissal after a message the boy's mother wrote to her and accidentally sent her, writing "another black person".
The couple denies their racism and makes the case look like a "money-snapping".
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed discomfort when she found out that Giselle Maurice, the new child care provider, was black on her first day in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband, "NO MORE BLACK."
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman fired African-American Mrs Maurice as "disturbed" after noticing her glitch, saying the nanny had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day, and then she was sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice sues the couple for dismissal compensation, demanding $350 a day for a six-month period in which he was hired without a contract and worked at home.
"I want to show them that they can't do things like that," she told the Post on Friday.
In response to their claims that they are racist, the couple states that it makes sense to terminate Maurice's job because they fear that they cannot trust him after offending him.
Her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post, "My wife sent him something he didn't really mean.
He's not racist.
"We are not racist people," he says.
"But would you, even by mistake, hand your children over to someone you've been rude to?
Your newborn baby?
Don't."
Plasco sees the case as an effort to "snap money", adding that the baby was only born two months ago and that his wife is "in a very difficult situation".
"So you're going to sue someone like that?" he says.
"That's not very nice," he adds, an investment expert.
The legal process is still going on, but public opinion is getting hit on the ground on social media due to their double behavior and logic.
A new letter shows Paddington publishers fear readers may not be able to relate to a talking bear.
Born shortly after Bond's book was accepted, his daughter, Karen Jankel, said of the letter: "It is very difficult to replace someone who reads for the first time before it is published.
It's fun to see what we know now about Paddington's great success."
Jankel, who worked as a BBC cameraman before inspiration came from the mouth of a little teddy bear to write a children's book, said his father was optimistic about the possibility of his work being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books after his father's death last year was "both bitter and sweet".
He said his father, whom he described as "a very important member of our family", was also quietly proud of the success he had achieved at the end of the book.
"My father was a very quiet man and not boastful of his actions," he said.
"But since Paddington is so real to him, you feel like you have a child who has accomplished something, and even if it's not your success, you're proud of it.
I think that's how my father judged Paddington's success.
Although it was his invention and the product of his dream, he always gave Paddington his due."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, his daughter, Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, was removed, and doctors tried to save the woman's life, but they were unsuccessful.
"Nad called me regularly and said it was really bad and he wasn't expected to live," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling him he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey."
"We'll be together again soon."
I'll be with you.
The medication doctors gave to keep your heart pumping blood slowly depleted and left your body.
He had died a while ago and it was over now.
I knew what was going to happen, and I just had to sit and wait.
I couldn't scream because I was in a place with family members and a lot of people, I couldn't scream and cry.
I really needed to hold myself."
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is now mourning her daughter, finally boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficulties she would face.
"No one knew," he said.
"I bowed my head and tears flowed through my eyes.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad during the flight.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved him."
Women who lose loved ones glue cards to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide are trying to stop others from ending their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been glued to the Welsh bridge for some time with inspirational messages and cards with phone numbers from people who can be called for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, began to struggle with depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," Davis says.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son is a promising cook who makes everyone around him smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They used to say his smile was cheering around."
But before his death, he quit his job because he was "at a very bad time".
In 2014, the first person to realize that Tyler had taken his own life was his brother, who was 11 years old at the time.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm constantly concerned that it will have a vindictive effect."
Ms. Davis says the reason she made the cards is to "make people realize that there are people you can always go and talk to, even if it's a friend."
"Don't be silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davis's for years, lost her 15-year-old wife Mark shortly after her mother's death.
"He never told me he was unhappy or depressed," she said.
"We noticed a change in his attitude a few days before Christmas.
Christmas Day was extremely bad, with the children not even making eye contact with them when they opened their gift wrappers."
He said his wife's death was a major trauma to the whole family, but they had to get through it: "He's drilling a hole in the heart of the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's fate will be determined by the FBI's investigation
"I think, if an investigation had been conducted on a limited scale and time as he wanted, we could have reached an agreement," Mr Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee, which had fallen into a stalemate due to partisanship, would be "dismembered".
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters ask the FBI to do an investigation?
The whole reason for their reluctance is timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans do a bad job as expected on November 6th, efforts to get the person they want elected to the highest court in the country will be severely damaged.
George W. Bush had been lobbying with Senators for some time to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who had worked for him in the White House in the past, who had made him meet his current wife Ashley, his former personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now filling their seats.
It is currently unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach 50 votes in the Senate, if he can, Vice President Mike Pence can break the tie and admit himself to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Koreans fleeing Kim's rule "falls"
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea declined after Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Referring to information from the South's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug said that the number of asylum seekers fell from 2,706 in 2011 to 1,127 last year.
Mr. Park said that tightened border controls between North Korea and China and human traffickers are the most important factors to demand larger fees.
Pyongyang has not made any statements.
The vast majority of asylum seekers fleeing the North are being offered the opportunity for South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of these people flee the country via China, which has the longest borders with North Korea and allows for an easier transition from the seriously protected Disarmed Zone (SB) between the two Koreas.
China considers those fleeing the country as illegal immigrants rather than asylum seekers, often returning them home.
Relations between North and South, which are still technically at war, have improved greatly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss pending nuclear disarmament.
This meeting took place after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticised the United States for not making enough progress on sanctions since then.
"If we can't trust the United States, we can't put our national security at risk, and we can't be the first to do a unilateral disarmament under these circumstances," Mr. Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called it "hysterical" for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and said it was neurally ineligible to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this statement in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't ignore the fact that if a woman did the same things, people would say 'hysterical'," Pelosi said in front of Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emboldened his claims that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was quite emotional, almost screaming at times and sometimes unable to speak when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also publicly cursed the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "disgusting and planned character assassination" organized by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony was evidence that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think with these statements and his attitude towards the Clintons and the Democrats, he reveals his own incompetence," he said.
Kavanaugh is elected, and Pelosi hesitated to answer when Democrats were asked if he would appeal to the Supreme Court if he secured a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll tell you this; if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not even fit to be in the court he's in, let alone serve in the Supreme Court," he said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge in the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that Kavanaugh was concerned as a Democrat, as he was seen as a conservative judge, regarding potential provisions he would make against the Economic Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade.
At admission hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
"A hysterical, prejudiced person should not go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great?'" Pelosi said.
And Women Should Use It.
A justifiable criticism can't express them without crying, even though the months and years are full of rage.
45 years later, Mrs. Steinem said to me, "We cry when we're angry."
"It's not uncommon, is it?"
He went on to say, "A woman who was a manager somewhere had helped me a lot, and when she got angry, she would cry, but when she developed a technique and started to get angry and cry, she would say to the person she was talking to with this technique, 'You might think I'm sorry I was crying.
I'm angry," he said.
And then it went on.
I think that's very clever."
Partly due to its misunderstanding at its core, tears appear as an expression of anger.
I have a memory that I remember very well from one of my first jobs; I was crying incredibly furiously in an office where men were in the majority, a woman of an older age, a cold manager who I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me from the neck and pulled me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They won't understand that you're angry.
They'll think you're upset and they'll be happy because they think they can influence you."
Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, a Democratic congressman at the time, had worked with her during Gary Hart's run for president.
When Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business in 1987 and pulled out of the race, the deeply confused Mrs. Schroeder realized that there was no obstacle to her discovering the idea of a presidential nomination for herself.
"It wasn't much of a thought-out decision," he says, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
'The Cotton Princess and the Seven Dwarves,' said one."
He was behind on finding funds because he started his campaign late and vowed not to enter the race until he raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He noticed that some of his supporters, who gave men $1,000, only gave him $250.
"Do they think I'm being discounted?" he wondered.
In a speech he announced he would not launch an official campaign, his gratitude for the people who supported him was so filled with feelings of frustration and anger caused by sexism that it made it so difficult to find money and target voters instead of delegates.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," said Mrs. Schroeder, recalling the press' reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write about carrying a grave.
'She'd cry'?"
How can the US-China trade war benefit Beijing?
The first shots of the trade war between the United States and China were very violent, far from ending the war, but the gap between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump issued the first warning, bringing additional tax on China's most important export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most notable tension came this week when additional customs duties were introduced on some products worth a total of $200 billion (150 billion pounds), and in other words, half of the products entering the United States from China were taxed.
Beijing responded more gently each time, and the last time it raised tariffs on five percent of American products, worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with the same strength, and it seems unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will give up anytime soon.
Stepping back to Washington requires the fulfillment of demands, but it would be too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping to openly submit to the United States.
Still, experts say that if China plays its cards correctly, it could be positively affected in the long run by pressures from the trade war with the United States by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would cause economic turmoil in one of the two countries is far more dangerous than the people following the developments had previously predicted," said researcher Abigail Grace, who worked in a pool of thought called the New American Security Center.
Foreign Minister says "Syria 'ready' for return of asylum seekers"
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of asylum seekers and seeks help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country has improved.
"Thanks to the fight against terrorism, the ground is now stronger and our land is safer," he said.
The government is continuing the rehabilitation process to return the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
Due to unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods, and terrorism, all conditions exist for migrants to voluntarily return to their countries where they have to leave.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country due to the war that began in 2011.
As many as six million of the people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime is open to future aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he underlined that they would not accept conditional assistance and assistance from the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe embraces Ryder Cup win in Paris
With European Team 10.5 against 16.5, Paris won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. Team at Le Golf National outside France.
With this defeat, the United States suffered its sixth consecutive defeat in Europe and has not won any Ryder Cups in Europe since 1993.
He regained the European crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team received the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The US star Phil Mickelson, who had a tough fight for most of the tournament, hit the water in the par-3 16th hole and gave the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all rounds and was one of four players to advance 5-0-0 from the start of the tournament's current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by Danish Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest ranked player in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest ranked player, won 2-1 against the British Ian Poulter, who was likely to never qualify for the Ryder Cup again.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, who had participated in the Ryder Cup eight times, was the highest winner of all time in Europe with a career score of 25.5.
"I don't normally cry, but I can't stand it today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful that Thomas chose me and that he believed in me.
I'm very, very happy to have the trophy back.
It's about the team and I'm very happy to be able to help," said Garcia, who was moved after the European win.
He turns the torch over to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in Sunday's singles games.
"I'm experiencing the incredible pride of defeating Tiger Woods, which I grew up watching," said Rahm, 23, who was a member of the team.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 point history in the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who came in first place after Jack Nicklaus with 14 major championships.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament, the entire U.S. team struggled to find a free pass all weekend.
After a disappointing performance for his team, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We swept through Europe this morning.
We fought.
I'm getting Thomas a hat.
He's a great captain.
Each of the 12 players played very well.
We will regroup the team, work with the PGA and Ryder Cup Committee in America, and keep moving forward.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be their captain.
Hats need to be removed.
They played better than us."
