A Republican Strategy to Obstacle Obama’s Reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center regards the latter as a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And along the same lines, a majority of American governments enacted new laws since 2009 that made it difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has spread following the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with a photograph, as well as proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day, and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present an identity card with a photograph.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
Therefore, the Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card with photography.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security Card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack such an identity card.
But, often, obtaining the required identity card costs more than $100.
Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African-Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have a photo identity card.
And there's more.
In many states students, voters who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by such clubs.
Prior to 2004 no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to file such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of the election in eight states.
They also limited the right of individuals and groups to set up a help desk for voters wishing to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 brought the registration rate of new voters down in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favoured reducing the period of advance voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida elections, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter accounted for only 13% of the state's voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the exact same thing happened.
They represent only 11 per cent of voters, or 24 per cent of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Attorney General's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo identity card.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Detection: Doing the Test or Not Doing It?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant in themselves, doubt whether or not screening tests should be carried out.
Take the test or not?
We've asked two specialists for advice.
Studies in the United States found a high rate of contagion among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
On the other hand, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of metastases if the screening test has not been performed.
I recommend, therefore, the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of their cancer. They should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not harm life in the long term, in which case they should rather opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, as cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you take the test anyway.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not you should have the test.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risks of the disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
Fatness and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon, and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas, and uterus.
"Research shows that regular life-long physical activity protects against breast cancer," they add.
Feeding
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, they scale the risks of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, for the time being his investigations are inconclusive.
According to SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While one found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another found an increase in the risk of prostate cancer.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about each other's concerns and family history with his or her doctor.
"Doing the screening test doesn't cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is a participant in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it's not entirely clear that it's about Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume it's about Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem slim. We'll see what it's about.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because it'll end up hurting you.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also in it a law of these characteristics: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantity state"; a "state" consisting, grossly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who obey wisely at the beginning of Pauli.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not speak here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, one might stress here, are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "light particle" that acts as a "message" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave is born (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the bosons "force carriers".
More stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "unordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it it requires reaching extremely high energies, a little as if it were an iced pond in which only a thick rock could slide down the surface.
That is why it takes a huge particle accelerator such as CERN (the great hadron collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand by itself attached to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what "can all these investigations contribute?" asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between MS observations and predictions.
For their part, many fervently want them to meet, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that plugs certain holes in the model.
This, it has to be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of such research on our day-to-day lives is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that it will have none.
For you to see: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They entertained scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who produced the first continuous laser (the first being pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory aparate".
Imagine...
Moreover, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself produced a light catcher in 1969 in the course of his optical research.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this catcher now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Physics Prize in 2009.
That doesn't mean, of course, that LHC activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In its Commission Dying in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon as a bill was being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year break.
"I had been given five years of life, but I've been like this for seven years," he says, made a pass, lying on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on her — a huge weakness that prevents her from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he is resigned to be helped to eat.
Brave, he even comes to smile, to talk to strangers who devote attention to him, bring him medicines and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is for my diarrhea to heal, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees on his feet," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois centre.
Returning to childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "healing" care.
The greatest fear of 89-year-old Mrs. A. is to die "conscious and drowned."
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any more desires left in this life," she says, before accepting to put on a mask to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the next few days, a final visit from his son who lives in Italy.
With a group of volunteers, Victor-Gadbois offers body care and food aid.
They are palliative care that is given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, since we know we'll all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the center's doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, as required.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, your son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center Victor-Gadbois days pass without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savors his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, having tried everything to survive.
"Since six months ago, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who are sick of cancer," Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
Seventy-seven per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of his or her life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care centre.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack of health care in Quebec that causes many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by palliative care eminences, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate its opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's healthcare system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," she says, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering great pains without having done what is necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients will want to die just because they do not receive adequate care."
And in parallel, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's hopes for survival were already low when she left a tiring chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that she wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask to die are grateful to their caregivers for not attending to their demands once their pain has been alleviated thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely almighty in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative home care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be relieved."
This report has been made possible by a journalism scholarship from Canada's health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fund-raisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian Mafia tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias are part.
An "industry" that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how the system is sprayed once we've hunted the big media," says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by an in-depth investigation into the embezzlements linked to road contracts in Quebec, which Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest at the time had consented only to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of research in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, while hoping to be able to "prove the existing ploys behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government auditors, researchers and analysts.
This unit operates in addition to the "Marteau squad" police officers, who, since 2009, have made Montreal's "sculpture cartel" moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has conducted a serial search of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, third Quebec City.
Repeated bribes are suspected to have been bagged in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally accused.
The latter has caused shock in explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay's party.
M. Zambito distributed money to right-handed and sinister parties during the 2000s, granting more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the corruption "system" worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road officials have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30 and 40 per cent for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led to a huge crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to the promoters in the middle of a real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money
From the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she assures that she pulls "a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and fish the culprits".
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning up the wounds, but we would need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and to be very alert so that dubious practices do not recur.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned above all about the role of the ''politicians elected to the current of the ploy".
Estimating by 70% the proportion of dirty money spent on funding election campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I have been told that this is but a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as electoral spending is not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It calls for a complete revision of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "we cannot go any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"The PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I move on from day to day by his side.
Technical staff has also provided me with a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything's going really fast in football.
But I don't get hot.
From my beginnings at INF Clairefontaine's pre-formation center to my passing through Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced at leaps and bounds.
He's going to benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to contesting very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me feel like fighting and giving it all away.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me much in terms of my positioning.
He's backed up by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the equipment?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in League 1 and is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken away our position as leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth-finals in style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish the first of our league in front of Porto in order to receive the eighth round of finals.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He's got the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
That is not the case today.
At the economic level, the PSG is dedicated to its means for this project to be realized.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it constitute a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
Last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think he'll be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it away.
Do you think the media expects more from the PSG?
It's normal for them to expect a lot from us if we think about what's been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we won 4–0 at home to Troyes, that they still run into things that reproach us is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the League of Champions we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City which, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for eighth-finals, and they too have invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our adversaries and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successes.
We'd better say we have a Zlatan dependency.
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and he scores a lot of goals.
He has come to prove that he is the star of League 1.
And he's shown on every team he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to make progress.
How have you lived the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
He was very excited to participate in this Eurocup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and I came out reinforced.
Today I manage to play good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the bleus.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why we have exemplary behaviour today.
What do you see of Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the bleus?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying us for the Euro Cup.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the team to Brazil.
Did the 16 October (1-1) draw in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not lived a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from equal to equal.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded through 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin quote, having reached the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning today to around $10 (the quotes are counted on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not impressive if we compare it with global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual coin types such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and which can be won by playing or can be purchased (and sometimes even redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositaries of accounting books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins changes are contained in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
It is a phase of file cutting, that is, of transforming a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical footprint.
Computers "cook" the new transaction and add a number before "trace" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at first).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the set chain of other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, in order to commit a fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very fast (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphan, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the calculus power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The failure used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Major actors such as Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November the "giant sales" were launched.
"They changed $30,000," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogic book on that currency, believes quite well in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a non-contact mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to put into operation in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They simply provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to prevail, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report the ECB intends to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We've left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have especially punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even assisted by local insurgents, these will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the almond-planted hills thanks to French credits, was made in order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without attack, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx into Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country enveloped in fire and blood because of fighting between different factions.
His seizure of control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking government land to resell it as land for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting alongside huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as well as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and appreciated its advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
Young people who would not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders would have to be given jobs.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is eager for mobile phones. TV and its Turkish leaflets presenting a modern world have great fans throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the position of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly in connection with the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country had been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been repaired and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
There was widespread rumor that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig the immense Buddha site and remain there as the province's most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, will also need to re-establish their normal relations.
French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' colleges, boys' colleges, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain localities.
These works, which are greedy for obtaining local labour, have helped to contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increase in cultivation areas.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys often over 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
For them to be free from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and to reach them directly.
A forceps constitution in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play everything for the whole.
He caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And for almost two years Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial embroilment.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues "treasoning his word" and "pissing the right".
On the part of its supporters, it ensures that this is a step towards ending the institutional and political crisis more quickly and accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be organised within the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to renounce their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this remedy has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either they vote my text or maintain full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment that 85 members of this Islamist Constituent Assembly, the vast majority of them, voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be achieved, 11 people, substitute members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As expected, the articles voted unanimously.
Commentators are also pleased that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent's clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that “the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of law”, remains the same as article 2 of the Constitution.
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that “principles” could be replaced by “rules”, which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than an advertising ruse.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who is to confirm its conformity with the laws of the Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy."
Liberal fears are further heightened by the fact that the next rector of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used imitate religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might be asked in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to pronounce themselves above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will claim that there are few compared to those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will prosecutions of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as called for by associations for the defence of human rights.
They also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially in the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing had been the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to be on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone entering this "baptismal pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the crowded nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest number of holy places is in Jerusalem.
The believers travel here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of the Anointing and the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their desires, which will then come true.
Take a vertical journey
It was the ruins of the Masada Fortress that remained of a secret refuge against enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, can only those who engage in climbing.
The others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m you will find the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Bus services are available from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
On a single trip you won't be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Qumran Rolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he features canvases by impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth going through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives ring.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the temperature of the water does not fall from 21 degrees and the air heats up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are brine that easily sustain even those who can't swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salt water, brine and healing muds and to fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous maritime route that linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls in the street of your "self" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently 1-3$,8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly made up of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transhipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Sabbaths are celebrated.
From Friday night until the sunset on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning starts a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, excluding pork, seafood, flakeless fish and dishes that combine milk and meat.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a variety of sauces, the falafel, which are ground chickpea balls, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats who "walk to their liking" in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Roarers love crowded places and don't reject treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) a day.
Besides insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bike will come out for 15 shekels a day.
Entrances to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that is 51% higher than the same rate in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While deputies and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the law on compulsory examination, scammers who trade in "false" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force, according to which each migrant worker must take an examination to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to take the language test, but also that of Russian history and the fundamentals of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the work permit.
Exceptions are made for citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who obtained their education and diploma certificates prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the People's Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take tests in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centers are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But the defenders of rights, long before the law came into force, were many times able to ask this question to the press: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Many people are talking today about defending the rights of labor immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of his rights must begin before his departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, put a "paid little trip" into a creepy, narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him consume themselves for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the wages promised," confirms the head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajik Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be angry, Chief!
Meanwhile, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much his fault but his own misfortune: few Turkmenos, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, let alone dress them up, fit them and buy them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first chance.
It's hard, if you don't know the tongue, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as the language law was concerned, defenders of rights pointed out an important point.
The examinations will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not that easy.
The cause lies in bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only 1,500 rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and extortion cases appear.
"They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be cheap, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it became clear that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several "false" certificates of language proficiency have already been seized by Federal Immigration Service officials.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document 7,000 rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker 3,000 rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to successfully pass the test the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian-speaking immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: Squeezing shots during wedding celebrations in which there were luckily no casualties, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Squeezing seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a licence to carry weapons from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying "hard-handed politics".
An open letter has appeared in the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that they desist from such measures of "nonsensical legality".
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, commented Russia's BBC news service, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 firearms offences registered in internal affairs bodies were committed during six months of 2012, compared with a total of 1168 offences registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, in his words, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High General Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts orders for weapons
The first, "army or military clothing", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves," says Baranets.
The next type of "black weapon," stolen by criminals and security forces representatives.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are sold from military arsenals.
There were often explosions in many military arsenals.
"There are proven versions that some fires were arson to cover the foul," says an ex-military officer.
According to Baranets, gun manufacturers also put their granite in.
"Private weapons factories have now proliferated that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including the Moscow market," says the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes handmade, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have estimated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Governance Issues Analysis and Planning Centre.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to investigators, 17 per cent of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14 per cent of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5 per cent correspond to “illegal archaeology”.
The gun store clerk, who asked for his last name not to be mentioned, says that weapons found by illegal bulldozers have not been bought by anyone for a long time now because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This one takes the gun to the city and sells it at 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be complied with, they make test purchases from illegal arms dealers," adds the clerk.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed me to go to the "Begovaya" platform, where a man would be taking me to a "schin" where we could negotiate.
The price of the gun, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there too you have to get there, say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that his daughter had dropped a tooth".
I can even get a couple of steel mittens through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not gonna rat on him.
Rookies look for weapons in different ways.
Former militaryman Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't "everything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered cat by hare: everything there is can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me a chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
This does not require any document or personal encounters.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the ad "Buy a gun or machine gun."
There users place their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," he asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"Compro gun TT. Moscow", laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and two-handedly captures those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
former military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: the website is usually registered outside the reach of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," says the NGO's press secretary "The Right to Arms," Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an order is placed online, one is left unarmed and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and two-handedly captures those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish towards the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half must be waited.
It's sent from the military warehouses by the middle-ranking chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia was reduced by 7%, which is 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers at "McDonald's"
In the past few days, a wave of protests against the low wages paid in Walmart corporation supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken", have begun in the United States.
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and become tame in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the aim of the organizers of the protests is the creation of workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States, the orgy of rebates that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by confrontations, began.
On that day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside trade unions and left-wing activists in the corporation's stores, whose products are aimed at modest and moderate-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" protest participants demanded the increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they now spend.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that the protest took place in only nine states and that it caused no loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold around 5000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview to the left-wing website Huffington Post, that they left their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been just "another public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city have no appreciation for them, and so for now there are none), but the McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, regular workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
No one wins less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, to me it's incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers went through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble into some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on a Wall Street Journal magazine forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them with.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, that is, double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from denying them this right and punishing union activists with trickery and layoffs.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive turnover of staff.
Discordants
Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place midway through the McDonald's rally near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says he's selling billions of portions, and then doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
Protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support fast food workers to get fair wages and the economic prosperity every New Yorker deserves."
As described in the New York Times, this has been the largest manifestation of this kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York work.
It is not yet clear whether this will spark a massive movement.
"For now, fooling the brain isn't that easy."
The topic of augmented reality, so popular among modern technology enthusiasts, is lately perceived normally mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was diluted that for the scientists of that company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted to the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group's study?
- We are dedicated to person-computer interaction, but we also try to broaden the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has taken interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We're trying to change this, we're working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
The world of computing must be freed to ours, to the physicist, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, screw those dumb virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you can't consider it a panacea, you still have to solve the question of privacy, because you don't always want others to find out about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not of loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device's camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this soda can?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, you want to force users to adapt to what they can or can't do right now the machine?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we're going to have to work mainly on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Are they missing resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and current movements of 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects man-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact to make the frames per second more.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible fingerboard.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn't presented its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smartphone up in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could move from glasses to smartphone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also to any simple mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as an image support.
Keep track of the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at bringing tangibility to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to what one feels if someone was blowing it into the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what it looks like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, we still have to work for many years.
That's what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St.Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens in front, to the vanguard of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the Saint Petersburg scene, whose achievements go beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they were displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg's Vanguardism of the late 1980s - early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took an organillo into his hands and became the organiller of Saint Petersburg, as he has matured to play such a difficult role, because of his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you go around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little grey provokes aggressiveness and agitation of properties that are not good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand you were supposed to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new, free ones like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the later ones exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I joined the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
And all this came together at your art clinic... it was important for me to meet at the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a music arts club, a bohemian club, the home of the Bohemian St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began playing live, it became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There went our employees and regular customers.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very uncultivated.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them the actuality and occurrence is clearly expressed.
I'm doing a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns everything is embarrassed and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothes.
Now you're being followed by clothes, oriented on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, maybe that person shouldn't even shake hands, but spit in his face.
And deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
A cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped into herds, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons another.
Now they've all been divided into microcommunities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come in thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event go 300 people, 10 thousand will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When I was young I made such pictures that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money only to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is one concept: official of culture.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were the right ones everything was otherwise, kings might not have understood culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level are needed to properly evaluate these and make their way.
Now subjective personal taste is prospering.
The same thing Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is Saint Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land there.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with humans on board leave in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with flora began to be addressed.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century now.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophiles.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops under weightless conditions.
We get a normal chick as a result.
But then the trouble starts.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it must stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Not finding support, the chicks gave random flips.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they would just die.
"And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," comments Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological miniarch flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instincts.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been travelling into space for 50 years now.
Tereshkova took the greatest risk.
And the most precious thing about humanity is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say, if it's after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says Vakhtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the aerospace sector.
In June 1964, only one year after the flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has worked out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The cosmonaut preparation centre hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
Under conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable yet still hostile environment, for a newborn child it is his or her birth element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the time of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swim monitor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, gravitation, the force of gravity, is necessary for women.
In weightlessness the abdominal muscles and pelvis decrepit very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we skipped that, relying on the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress up in a special training suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing a child to be born in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally maladapted person," previews the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
However, over time this will become a reality, when human beings on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their space-born children.
Head of NKÚ: Inspection of the "švarc" system has not found the politician guilty
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is limping.
This is what Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NKU) says in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This, in my opinion, is what we lack," thus describing the current situation.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also arrive at similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the SDG (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So, is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor demand obligations," Kala says.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and German teams, in the framework of which the legislation concerning public awards in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we began to carry out about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regularizes how public awards should be organised, followed by legislation in force in each country and then praxis itself.
We have brought everything together and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "stricter and more complete", but concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate ever stricter rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely such a common control that could help us to stop investing in the enforcement of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting a right thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the award limit means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "papering", that those who want to look for system failures can do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public awards.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it a NKU-like office or is it organized differently?
As far as offices, such as NKU, are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also to some extent analytical, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this regard it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Audit Court (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be precisely specified where it is best.
Could it be better, for example, as regards the quality of inspectors?
That's for sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make these kinds of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as models must face a large number of problems.
If you didn't, you wouldn't have any benefit in collaborating with our office, would you?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public awards mean for your Office? Is it in any way manifesting its impact?
Given that the validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been expressed in the supervisory proceedings.
Since we carry out ex post checks, we need to have a certain delay.
For the time being, it is evident in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and similar.
Do you consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or rather a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation is "hardened" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under the previous regulations, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each law not respected in the matter of public awards meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it then make sense to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this initiated path leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the Office from acting which has an obligation to carry out such controls and to demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we're gonna act like nothing.
In the law on public awards, the law is quite strict as to how formal action should be taken, and this is how it should be in order to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer for not meeting the formal demands.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice sheets, although they are mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads present ice and snowboards.
Although most tracks are passable, caution should be extreme in some cases.
Karlovy Vary region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but presented ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the regional road operations control centre.
The R6 fast track and the first-class road in the region are now unfettered.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frosty and slippery.
In addition, all second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with traces of ice and stumped snow.
There is a need for increased attention on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the tracks, reports the Roads and Highways Directorate on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of forming ice sheets, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Freezing can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow especially on the roads of the Krkonoše mountains to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of stumped snow in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Knůnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will today be between clear and partially cloudy, with no rainfall.
Temperatures will usually range between three below zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable today morning, although caution must be exercised and time must be adapted.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and subsequent fall in temperatures, some tracks may also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will find themselves in fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what follows from the information provided by the road operations control centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is almost unfettered, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometre 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the road of Pilsen and Tachov bordering Germany there may be stretches with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so, in this case, it is also noticed of stretches with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the less busy tracks in the Šumava area.
Olomouc region
Drivers heading for the highest areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators removed snow during the night; on the Šumper road they accumulated about three centimeters of snow, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most tracks are unfettered.
"In the highest areas of the Šumper road, remains of snow remain.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will find half-snow discarded towards Jeseník", confirmed today an operator of the road administration from Šumper to ČTK.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also came to the Jesenická and, after chemical treatment, the tracks of the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the tracks are unfettered, in the Šternberská road drivers should drive with caution on the forest sections, where the tracks are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec region
Road operators in northern Bohemia reported complications on different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the roadway. Instead, in the lowest areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
There have been no service complications.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavorable conditions have been announced since the general roads on I/13, on the border between the Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut off by the branches of trees that had arched on the track with the weight of snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just under a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to grab.
The Tap Tap Tap music group likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state charity act that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar enunciated for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, December 20 at 9 pm, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we forged the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keyrings against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, entitled "End of the World, Cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can it be heard at benefit concerts?
Of course it is, and it'll be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time at all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration arise?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will the money raised at concerts against the end of the world be used for?
To equipment for the educational center without barriers Studeo, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličk
Students at the Jedličkův ústav school regularly receive visits from teachers who perform fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make this possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague there will be Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, please consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "spectacular action" planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the festival Pražské jaro, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage that we are in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
What is the logistics and organization of these trips like?
It's not as difficult as it may seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and besides we carry a lot of weight, boxes with instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not stop surprising me.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything came out smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you met so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still rare for a person to travel alone through the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil association had been established to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what respects should we take examples of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people they directly affect.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a severe disability to travel on their own in public and to go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap, let's go a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, it will really begin to change everything.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkův ústav, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I formed an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator LÃ¡a Angelovič says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not come until these last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot by connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to EU support, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that you can do something else.
Show business is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is cautiously accepted and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not just a step forward for them, but for society as a whole.
Did the fact that you're a demanding boss help you, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go for two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: LÃ¡a Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will connect at the end of the evening via video conference to sing the band's song The Tap Tap "End of the World, Canceled"
The objective of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO education centre in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, which costs 25 million Czech kroner.
Entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entry in the pre-sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Poland was accepted as a twelfth member of ESA at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries last week. It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland initiated intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland's road to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw astronomical observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch award for his "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great impeller of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a dresine was built in Poland and was to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known either.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresin or for its braking.
The information about this dresin is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 Polish artillery began to engage in missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the material preserved, it becomes clear that the investigation reached the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all missile technology projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of the magazine Problemy, for the first time reference is made to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
By that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since early 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Beginning in 1956, the PTA significantly participated in the development of the RM probe rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was conducted.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial testing of the two-stage RM-2 rockets in the B
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was to be subject to actual scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, the space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The peak peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km high.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was subsequently built.
Mention should also be made of Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the law social labor.
The resolution aroused a heated discussion in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at the problems from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with rampant financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) results in economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to this end "produces a fall" in the competitor's price with the aim of taking over most of the market and thus increasing its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing.The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social spending of the state necessarily increases.
This situation is conducive to the total lack of interest on the part of employers in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their desire to obtain benefits.
The situation is so universally known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own people without taking into account social decline.
This is particularly evident in changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially as regards wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees to labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with widening the gap between poor and rich.
For a number of years now, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already as high as one million.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed on such a low wage that the state must pay the rest in order to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of virtually all the southern states of the EU lead, without a doubt, to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to mallive with a lousy salary at the limit of society, in the hope that one day private investment capital will arrive in the country.
Is it necessary to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to be satiety that the state should not bring capital to the economy, that leading the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital tooth and nail defends the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence the political march and, therefore, the state as a whole with its selfishness.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is virtually reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
The situation in Germany is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission the drafting of bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
These kinds of bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracies are quickly in a situation such as that described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for a long time and the administrations were dealing with it by force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegally and aid to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unfettered and people went to the polls with the vow spoken of in advance"... "there were no people with a character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be serious that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"...Although Appiamos thought of Pompeii, Caesar came to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in antiquity, is that today's society is based on inconsiderate preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as that of then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the rampant liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
Suspension of the law on public awards is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution involves concrete socio-political reforms that strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Lab of Chaos.
"That nothing eats from violence and nothing ever could" (Nothing arises from violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (let's not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, diverse reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right to self-defence and box the Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and claims racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and calls Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is responsible for the massacres that are repeated regularly and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who takes advantage of the tensions that have dragged on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour statement in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have come to on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driving force behind the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
In every age we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this implies, it has not been possible to arrive in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't rule it out): the Rothschilds.
You don't write much about them.
Naturally.
In the nineties of the nineteenth century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have major stakes in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the War of Secession to print money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their eagerness for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd grade.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states throughout Europe; the second was aimed at eliminating colonial supremacy, especially of Britain, and the third was aimed at reducing the population of the land by between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their welfare and luxury would suffice and not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the wealthiest family group operates, along with the Rothschild, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis such as that of 1907 would not recur.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francis Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended in a sudden and unjustified way from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
In order to prepare the ground for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, in a covert way, a conflictive situation following the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it sufficed to serve the Germans with the Fuehrer's solution, which was strong enough and simple enough and pointed to the guilty, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, which set the flame and triggered the outbreak of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration laid the foundation for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope that the international bankers had tied him to in the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers managed to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how the sympathizers and detractors of Israel are divided sharply.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of everything there was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, like in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, where 20% of all world oil passes (the shipping corridor is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 are now displayed: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls his whole being.
"And it forces everyone, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on his right hand or forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand: whoever has two fingers in front, add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Movie Argo: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group from the Islamist student demonstration occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the US, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive prospect: throwing the Shah overboard could not allow it, since, if it did, it jeopardized the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
Imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the US, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck tracks an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helping a covert story an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the filming of a science fiction superproduction.
Combination of genders
The plan drawn up by "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
To make the lie seem truthful, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society had even a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a singular combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines moods. On the one hand we find well-documented sequences from Tehran. The sequence of credits shows emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were similarly reflected in the film; there are not many differences in this respect.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action takes no place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Likewise, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran runs in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy takeover is impressive for its synoptic ability which, at the same time, conveys the emotion of bewilderment and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the impostor team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he manages quite well. Sometimes he adds something to reality: here everything doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis is lurking at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the rampant search behind his trail turn into madness).
Argo's weakness is the uncontrollability that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses some dramatic stroke, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, value its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But if it collapses, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real history and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services may be, it is sufficient.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually presents a survey of the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a quota of 40 percent of women in management positions in large European companies," explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organizer.
Nominated absurdities include, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women were better off in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by people until the end of this year".
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher reported.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of life-long mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or the guideline shade the size of hens' cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual prohibition of using the term "butter spread" or the removal of the classic light bulb from shops has been criticized.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often makes such decisions under the pressure of one or the other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curves".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it only seeks to harmonise the national standards not homogenised to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive involves a waste of edibles.
The candidate to win the survey could be last year's US prescription that in inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The United States referred here to an American study according to which, when talking about toys, balloons are the main cause of infant death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction applies to the use of slugs by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation on European civil servants: anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, we must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the liberal economists association Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the established volume for canned mushrooms, which threatened it with a substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for grants.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," declared the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that in our country a lot of cereal was produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public competition for the purchase of cereal from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of Brussels grant applications.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often the subject of criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts and, in addition, more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved in budget negotiations.
The Czechs also have the sensitive fiber, just as other countries of the Union have the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even if our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc cheese, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and it was renamed "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugarcane distillate may be called rum, but not products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of EU protected designations of origin, together with the world-known feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the Mazapán of the German city Lübeck or Parma ham, are already found for example Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pohořelice and Třeboň carp and even the variety of Žatec hops.
As EU protected maras, you can be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the Hořice v Podkrkonoší wafers.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't run for office.
But I can no longer stand to see how it is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes and retirement age are increased.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am now forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run for senator or president.
He has already arrived in the Senate, but soon after he has set out for the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
I later specified that if I were elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we trample anyone who wants to initiate a change.
To this are added the media, which discredit you and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
From me it is said that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property over twenty million.
To do so, the law must be changed.
As president he does not have this competence and only the senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobbying group for the guidance profession to be recognized as self-employed work, and we did it.
The problem lies in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether right or left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without boxing or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Are you more of a right-wing or a left-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me, whether it's a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we get ahead of ourselves.
I don't care if someone's right-wing or left-wing, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the SDG and, in the same way, I will be against bad ideas.
You're joking when you're said to be a populist.
But you're not proving it by what you're saying?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament, he has only slogans left.
And with it he cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will, for example, get criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character pointing to disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Let us take for instance the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I claim that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I've just started in politics and I'm trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I'm trying to get things through myself, but in case it doesn't go well, I'll leave it in six years and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura's going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that with one person I do nothing, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the frauds with light heating oils.
I showed up on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did so voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time to do it, to check the unblemished past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have any money.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, there are only 20,000 kroner in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
He's talking about property statements, what's yours like?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youthful dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there's not much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The campaign costs essentially cover what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live from it, for example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run for office.
So you're still in business so you can live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I have promised, I have partly given up my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in spring.
People would want it to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I'm still winning.
If I was president, then I'd quit business.

The MVRDV architecture studio shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of Spijkenisse's library and the recently completed "book mountain" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and at last there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company located near the library, says, "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one enters those old-fashioned libraries for pleasure, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, has the dubious honor of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, some years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that's how policymakers decided that there was only one way to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture firm MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun and cynical buildings, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size into a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here it is, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, the so-called `Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million mountain rises at its intended location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and townhouse buildings.
In early November the book mountain was awarded the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small city without history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that this is a book paradise under a cheesebox.
Well it is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain massif, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of its climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the annealed brick floor and the elegant lanterns unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up you can see the park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally bookshelves are arranged along the façade and in the center there is a huge dark room that usually is uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is turn the classical spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention should be made of the black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
Eyesight, touch, and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more frequently shake their heads when they hear of this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that's how one day, on a Frisian farm, we come across the right byproduct from agriculture.
For many years now, in the greenhouses and fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of only a few millimetres thick has been used as a basis for holding the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was primed, for the first time in such quantities, to obtain plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car mix and sport shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain the reward awaits us: from the cafeteria not only has a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and its ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Even if it's hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Even though the book mountain is situated under a huge crystal pyramid, even on the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences across the glass façade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is about automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes the "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "late soul".
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical holes of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; at present it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are packed.
"There is nothing worse than an empty half-library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows his book is part of the library.
Even if I'm just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a great success in that discipline reigns that in the specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he may be.
Finally a starting point to shape their identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in US-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather harsh diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status to the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I do not think he supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is currently re-orienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
What makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are therefore at a crossroads.
From them they are expected to play a more independent role, but are not accustomed to doing so.
I think they're still testing their role, but they've already started the road to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What does a German 'normal' foreign policy mean in particular?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why he must be careful and not alienate himself from Arab public opinion or the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not attach such importance to it because it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the Palestinian vote?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic break-up as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to gain some respect from this.
After all, all this has shown that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the US has clearly been in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend this position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of views does not really have the magnitude that is attributed to it.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher body, but they must propel things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing with the euro now.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tough topic.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to assume a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to have a more important role to play.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main actor, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The influence of the US on European politics is decreasing more and more, but the EU does not fill that gap at the moment, so who remains?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more leading role.
Even if they don't like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular village, c'est la vie!

"Mark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-famous brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real ones do not file a claim.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be right.
"Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, attorney for the Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
A new case comes to my table every week.
Impersonators simply add a couple of letters to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the Puma sports goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet where he keeps seats from the Beijing brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are department stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a denomination that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, we have to fight it," demands Pattloch.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is complicated to have the registrations of dubious legality annulled and it also means a lot of money.
Processes can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a claim because so long had passed that the name the claim had already become a “market reality”.
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged China's brand," Pattloch says.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the star of Mercedes.
Volvo's buyer Geely initially used a white and blue logo that largely reminded BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the labor emergency situation returned to normal."
Thus, the amount of unprocessed claims processes has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain outstanding.
Fighting this costs a lot of money.
As is usually the case in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new entries around the world for the tenth consecutive year, according to the brand office.
This also seems to be the case with the number of valid logos, a figure of 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been bagged for rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting against this costs a lot of money, as shown by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese copycat.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the impersonator has managed to secure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO Trademark Office also rejected the appeal of the Muniques.
In the following two instances Freudenberg has been found right, but the opposing party continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the gates of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler hoped to be able to resolve the matter favourably and commended the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "sum of six figures in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was not successful.
"This shows how much we care," Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
in particular, whether copycats secure the rights to unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group had long since left this commercial area, but had been able to prevent registration.
"We have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and attorney Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely prudent in doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is to "register also in China everything that can be protected", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, he would then have to pay the opposing party license fees by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: dancing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
The story of a bond capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the vocals of the singers (contralto, bajo, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise, swirling, hindering and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get almost out of his way by trying to put order with his energetic and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers, between the ages of 23 and 69, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the householder.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found in Germany sponsors for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school's tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "narrator of stories" or "panegirist".
In this room no one knows how to speak fluently this Bantu language, but they do know how to sing.
For ten years this choir has been playing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud huts and straw, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not welcome circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of contagion by half.
More than 40 per cent of the population of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with just over thirty years has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this remote population, but what they saw mostly were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, possibilities in a poor country are more than limited.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since taken professional care of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the STDs of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, the human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Scabies and scabies are among parasites-borne STDs.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more often in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungal) and gonorrhea.
HIV transmission among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were recorded in 2011.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and are therefore not detected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100 percent protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through dirt infections and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you often change sexual partners.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for its performances throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the town of Zodwa Dlamini, a woman with self-confidence and leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It ensures that orphans find good accommodation, for example with one of their grandmothers.
The "gogos", as the older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof to live in and ensure that children attend school every day on time and wear their uniforms.
Those who have no one are left under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two henhouses and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has managed to have many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is evident throughout the country, it is not usually openly spoken of.
A King with 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and overflowing with excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless timers who travel the country from one side to the other and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "any corner you can get condoms for free, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact."
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many at the southernmost end of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in a black language; such recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to tear away a couple of tears from some rabid border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where singers visit sponsored children.
Although this small population hardly appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is well known.
"Come closer to Esitjeni, there the light shines," the local people say.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice in Mercury · Global Voices
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice sheet probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there is also ice water there, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shade.
It looks like it's at least 30 centimeters and probably even 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one links the finding of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says Chief Investigator of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other life components have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which endless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, called unromantic by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This torn image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic star formation area.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to an earthly continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This budding star could be captured in all its splendour for the first time by the Spitzer telescope infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.

One of the largest and most sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this area of star formation into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth the nuclei of two merging galaxies pounce toward each other to end up colliding irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it under the nickname Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble space telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located at 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a moment as a model for NASA's Hubble space telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roseta Nebula, new stars also continually emerge; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this very bright galaxy with a small black hole there's still no dust, just gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen could be found in the universe.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It appears that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have become more and more profound.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capability is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) anyone who has a computer can help, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 metres and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take images.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would look like.
However, the most important information from the cosmos comes from the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he sends images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of its mission, 1,235 candidates for planets had been located.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers start from the basis that there is ice in the southern pole of Mercury as well.
However, there is no reliable evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now certain that it is.

The mountain tour of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great strep through the winding road that passes next to forested hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
It's all green and juicy, one might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here live the talyshi, a village of which not much is known, apart from that they perfectly dominate the Persian and Azeri and that are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too solid architecture designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit fully into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely reach this place, as the road from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth enjoyed by the country thanks to the oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis of the place who have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who appears to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate certifying it.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov been wrong in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very elderly people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when no civil registration does exist.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 persons over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of talyshis, who worship meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or is it perhaps the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 he is relatively young for what is stylized by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, she untiringly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both became grandparents a long time ago.
Two young children also jump from one side to the other.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea served in typical glasses with a domed shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son discovers us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never dropped it and it's kept its color.
"I have never used a shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my whole life, I've never been shopping at a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything returned to its channel when the "loved father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the cult professed to the paternal figure of the nation, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, at which point the witness surrendered to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which one can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's gray-haired son is right: "In our culture the elders are highly respected."
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this isn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
In the Constitution, the term “Human Rights” is missing.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, with sharia as its basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in patheticism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, to the people and to God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Christian Copts, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, hopelessly submerged so far in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend his "to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world knows very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour evening meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the “principles of Islamic law”.
However, what does that mean by "principles"?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal room for manoeuvre that it entails, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia law.
This is at least what an added new article suggests: in all matters concerning sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power throughout Sunni Islamism.
It does not have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, which - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
Following the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morale and values".
It is a formulation so vague in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly speaking, this is nothing but censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead another forbids offending or slandering Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it is to be punished.
Just as doubtful is the formulation that prohibits “offensive to people”
Is a cartoon of the president enough or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft which has been presented to Mursi for signature and which, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for referendum.
"The Revolution Is Back"
The opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists for weeks.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir Square in the Cario and vowed to make the Act fail before it can come into effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third in the presidential election lists.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the trash can of history."
Through Twitter he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy."
"When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration; in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer across the Nile, before Cairo University.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it to the cry of "the people demand the application of the divine law".
They demanded that Mursi "clean up the country," while proclaiming: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi's supporters did not want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now the time would have come to let the people decide at the polls what direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old lawyer specializing in human rights and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution," laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three branches of government led to his resignation.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control."
Norwegian rakfisk: the world's most smelly fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has any bearing on its greed for a highly smelly fish?
Take a number of excessively cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is salted trout that is fermented in water during, depending on how smelly you prefer, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this most captivating delicacy, so to speak, captivating.
"You eat raw and then drink a glass of aquavit from a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the "General of the Rakfisk", who organizes the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small buckets and drinking important amounts of the drink from a drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," Havard says.
Drink can kill the smell.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near your nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, when poverty hit Norway and where, before cooling, fish was kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and until not too much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be an important, albeit rather smelly, part of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the coldness of 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it to be so.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22".
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's present wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, as she passes rakfisk trays and, with her long blonde hair and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like flaunting."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything except a small percentage of the money coming from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money that they did not have during the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with an unwrapped laugh.
I'm in the snow lining up to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, that smelly fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held where diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A television has connected live with a presenter wearing bow tie and surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
Looks like the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls off the chair, perhaps beaten by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fumes of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto Faces Hard Start · Global Voices
As Mexico's incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyzes the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, under the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the nation's management.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against narcotraffic that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, at the Oval Office.
"I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before rubbing shoulders with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his native state, that of Mexico.
A very populated and rapidly growing state, surrounding the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man.
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of on-site tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with their name at the entrance of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he will make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"In particular, in terms of security and economics, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was unbanked by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the qualification that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic man of state and, above all, he is a person who knows how to listen."
However, on the other side of the state that's not the impression many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Neza City, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, military intervention was called for to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desert plot, next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he did not know how to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critical accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I got home, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned," recalls Mrs.Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross in which one word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like I'm an old gossiper, a troublemaker, a whiner.
What they want is for you to simply accept what they say and shut up."
"But that can't be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico for the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during their term.
"I hope he's the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Neza City fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors claim
Prosecutors try to address Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse while in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in United States history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims to have suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecution's interrogation of Manning at a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of weekly visits by unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence ' s request to dismiss the case since his imprisonment had been harsh and had already resulted in sufficient punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in detention.
The army's intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was imprisoned in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and written down his answers.
When asked about the forms on Friday Fein, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the warders as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any allegations of ill-treatment, despite the fact that the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the visiting officers had spoken about those problems and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after having talked about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not denounced the treatment she received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council to examine the suicide intentions she had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime under which he was under.
The military said that they had placed him under this restrictive regime, which is below the level of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered committing suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning claimed that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while he slept.
He said that if the wardens could not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 regarding Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday's statement that, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order given to him by the warden that he should drop the blanket he could have covered himself with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic on his underwear or his flip flops to self-harm but that he had not.
Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account the experiences he had spent while in prison and drastically reduce his sentence in case he was convicted at the court martial, which was scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense stated that it plans to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanor crimes and defend other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held under the rules of application to every detainee in full custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provoking the posting of information on the Internet, leaking information from the national defense, and theft of property or public records.
If he's found guilty on all counts, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; they say they remember Mexicans from those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely come down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some signs pointed the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
Growing up in Central California, I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
This is ethnic shorthand, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians."
Later I decided to "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when Mexico's elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, included: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking forward to talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment it is as likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as he will venture to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of its territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma stand up for war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about grudges?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, somewhere in our family tree, there was one person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, coming from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendents and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And, even though we may now be living the American dream, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican dream.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us over the shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered to be part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexican.
Now, to further complicate things, from what I have learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as impromptu "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much grudge.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, folks.
Fair enough.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated much less.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their former conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left everything torn apart whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional commotion.
Perhaps this will make your struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their lethal impasse could de-escalate.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November is maintained, this week's clashes have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has been badly beaten.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and put the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza under pressure in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the world, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its unrelenting rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a reborn regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Exultant Hamas members say that the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where Hizbulah militant party dominates, passing through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental in Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood are brotherly cousins of Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's hard wing will draw the contrary conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, Hamas has been put on its site.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States was firmer than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for having started the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly because of the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that, under international law, they are illegal.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why spoil those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just like their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab spring might alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the area's superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions to Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains that of sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel's transfer of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to others who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the entry of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he omitted to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to him.
This attitude is a deplorable vision for the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic Tobacco Packaging Act enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases are displayed on cartons of a green off color, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pioneer in the world, comes into effect and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with a wrapper of an olive green shutdown, frightening images of body parts with diseases and depictions of sick children and babies as children of smokers.
With the exception of the different images and sanitary warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the marks, all printed on a small type of source.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by removing the features that make this habit glamour.
He relies on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
"It can be seen that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Other people say their business has benefited after the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, claimed that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover up the nasty pictures of the packs had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that she was waiting for more stocks.
"To us it's a good deal."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most vendors not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has now moved on to online marketing.
Australia has banned Internet advertising to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you market tobacco and you only have this little window left to promote your products, online space is the most compelling place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in brand reviews from "foot citizens" posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what new regulation implies than on marketing.
Industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules; these countries are asserting to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unjustly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries have significant trade volumes with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek claimed that the government had held discussions with other countries that are considering implementing similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the mandatory inclusion of images in packets.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are defiant.
"Photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
"You take the cigar and keep the package," says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Sincerely, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, indicates that uniform packs make it more difficult for him to place them on shelves.
"It usually took an hour to unwrap a delivery; now it takes me four," Yu says.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, that's it, okay, it's over and we shut down the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a little bored.
During the Thanksgiving holidays this year, unexpectedly I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying in suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is rather boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting about duty-free stores.
But more and more scholars and experts in child development praise the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it is well that, both we and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since, at present, most of us are connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we accept boredom in good spirits?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("Boredom, An Animated History") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, does not.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating from the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining published research and putting the idea before a 100-person discussion group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you."
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly."
Boring can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a question of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be theirs.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what's really happening to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September edition of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard in the adjoining room a full-volume television show that was unrelated, others listened to it with low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they found it difficult to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, attention disruption can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting faulty pieces in a manufacturing line, distracting music can help you not to get bored."
"In fact, we currently know that moving or scribbles, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, as they make that person more physically alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a "trend to boredom scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, states that using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a pager.
He discovered that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest heights," largely because both children and adolescents are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question at the beginning: Is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into the use of substances as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long run.
"So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he won't have learned to entertain himself or dose himself," Professor Fenske says.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Not only does your child learn to entertain himself, but he learns to better control himself in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Our goal should be, rather, to be comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to be more bored, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to relate it to something worthwhile," he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when noise stops."
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Use Law · Global Voices
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community college and footballer in Southeast Colorado, faces criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving around Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related items (smaller offences each carrying a fine of US$100) informing him of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes for drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana possession offenses are being overturned both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped pressing charges against those over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be passed legally once the law has come into effect in the coming weeks.
But Colorado's most conservative district prosecutors have committed to moving forward with open marijuana possession cases and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what's next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also thinking about the matter.
And they continue to seek advice on establishing a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licences; all of this before the deadline comes, December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or for worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so he will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent that will serve as a model for us," he says.
Washington's law, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be addressed during this period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide "appropriate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 metres of schools, parks, children's play areas or children's centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Legal Cannabis Center, a recently created research group.
On November 21, Oates, Aurora's chief police officer, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would stop bringing lawsuits for minor marijuana misdemeanors to people over 21 years of age and that the police would stop pressing charges against those crimes "with immediate effect."
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the city's regulations governing the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to persecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers and to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those misdemeanours that at the time they occurred were a crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like Mesa Rural County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Grand Junction police, the county's largest city, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, a county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time in enforcing the law until it changes," he said.
Despite the fact that 55 percent of voters supported the bill, it was never considered that bringing marijuana use for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier with district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those accused of marijuana possession and who is a local spokesperson for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
"They've spent so much time taking people to court that, in reality, they still can't accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the national test cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales frontier, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still foresees considering the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization hope that the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some outstanding arrests of patients and marijuana vendors for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
"Although drug agents are likely not to throw down doors to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to operate for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed under the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an ex-drug policy advisor to the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favor of what the community voted against voting in favor of what the state voted for."
Many questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I got kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
College students are not attacked for their views only now
I don't remember any time in my life that I haven't been dreaming about getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I supposed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking up my position at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the history career, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and wept.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had left because I was forced to drink in discounted cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for a single reason, which in the cradle of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
You might wonder what that's about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (grouping of undergraduate students) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously sidelined, personally attacked, and treated as unwelcome people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their college's equal opportunities committee to make sure they can express their views freely.
Their situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and presenting the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with the silver hilt.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Conservative Party Association at Nottingham University, stated in a Sunday paper that "there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other."
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, claims that this environment is "uncomfortable," while 19-year-old OUCA president-elect Stephanie Cherill claims that the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first weeks at Oxford I was more lonely than 1:00.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris causa" following cuts in funding for Higher Education.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that the professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery of conservative college students, but willingly participated in it.
The policy of miners' strike, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the seminar's wooden halls.
The first one I attended was to translate 18th century French texts into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't say one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake dough, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they simply fools?" he asked.
The other college kids laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French lessons in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt grunted.
I returned to my room as a soul in sorrow.
That night I sat alone at dinner time in college; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a sophomore English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labourers."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to hide.
I insisted that he disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick proved useless.
A freshman in Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that little song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet people who thought like me only after dusk?
Would I have to become a Labourer and repress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined for my college.
He was hated for being not only of the Conservative party, but also thatcher's advisor in foreign policy and one of the people writing his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place he considered provincial and insignificant and his adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I began to move daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said with sadness.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His sore eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would break if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had hinted, speaking totally seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old men."
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was snuggled in fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak crybaby.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only has formed 14 Prime Ministers of the Conservative Party but, to this day, hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", a retrospective apotheosic that brings together more than 130 couture dresses created by his "maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most pomegranate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches those personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from humble dressmaker of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to idol of the international "jet-set".
There's nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
"At least they don't turn off their cigarette butts on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his villa in Gstaad," explains former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, looking like a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the dressmaker.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the Paris High Seas Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art," he concludes.
Alcurnia parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-requited love.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-metre-long catwalk that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade along the catwalk to contemplate a dreamy "hearing" that looks like Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In that audience of mannequins shine names like that of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the dressmaker, in 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a gillette vest and a jacket from the Fall-Winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love of women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Fair.
I really like the colors he uses, they have great light and they're "donors" to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can never forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting old and the opportunity to wear one of his night suits...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, flying skirt, draped "corsage" and cleavage word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dressmaker's party dress with "the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the dressmaker calls his seamstresses) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a milestone of the haute couture of the late twentieth century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Overwhelmed for years with the elite's "savoir-être", Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
"I have always been struck by your refinement, your calmness, your neat and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was flawless, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano porters play life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone trails
There are people whose work is one hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living drawing sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies when it comes into contact with the air.
After removing large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two baskets of bamboo that he loads on his shoulders through steep stone trails.
They are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to climb at turtle's pace, keeping balance and groping their steps so as not to slip and fall down the cliff.
They know that any trip could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who took off years ago from the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for each kilo of sulphur they extract
Once above, tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys open their way and, gruelingly carrying the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilo of sulphur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As it is normal to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," Anto explains, who usually carries three carriers a day.
It takes three hours each and ends up ground, but they allow him to gather 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what I would gain in the field.
"The miners' wages are very high here, where coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is 2 million rupees (167 euros) ", explains the porter, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with her family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and is irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing his ass in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pay for it despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, he coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English language that is more than acceptable.
Punished by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other porters, he gets up every day at 2 a.m. because sulfur does not stop working at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater lighting up with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 porters load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its pungent profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs or provide any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and on their own weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of camera surcharge that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for the beasts and not for the people," says Madrusin, a 42-year-old strong porter who has been at the Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "as long as he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that leave the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of serious illnesses ... beyond, of course, their usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pains in the knees and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat road between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, aged 30, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest trades in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore Seeks Babies to Save Economy · Global Voices
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"Singapore population needs to grow".
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, let's do our civic duty and believe life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of an advertisement for mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bao (blon) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the announcement they will manage to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do "their national duty."
This is purely an Internet thing, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it so lightly is the Singaporean government.
Spend $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it is because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness, and delayed marriage and birth, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia is scarcely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and failing to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore governing party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says their "shoeboxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed.
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre seems to be not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
Private offline is private online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is the quality of private or "the scope of private life that has the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child under the age of 16?
How does it apply this definition in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by ventilating on the Internet situations that you probably wouldn't share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys between 10 and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on the personal level, and "in the user's password and name", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not be uploaded to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can meet them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also amuse myself with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or someone who's making a fool of themselves," he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just raise them," he adds.
"Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," she says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't listen to anyone recommending a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts open on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not to meet 20 of the people added in his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has hinted at him or asked him for his home address or his phone number.
"If I were pressured or demanded, I'd just pull them out of my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"It just gave him privacy."
Then explain a number of steps to securely configure the account.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I like him or I want him.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, master's degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite criterion on what is convenient or not to spread, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that."
"Also that they are selective when they care most about being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Below, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like a picture of yourself published by a friend?
Do you know what the others post about you?
When you tagged party photos, did you ask the other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same must be on social media," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says it is essential that parents read social media policies thoroughly.
By understanding each of the subparagraphs they have solid foundations for talking with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "Don't talk to strangers."
Unasur Summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Foreign Ministry and Presidency indicated at the beginning that they would hand it over after the closure, but later stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government's website at some point.
When consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a few brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the video without sound from the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information that circulated among the reporters was handed over by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian one.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the unrest of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is Humala's pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
On the official ASPA website it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that transmission systems were secured for all journalists but limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling of the Court of The Hague that would resolve a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the arguments of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will address and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today," said Humala, along with her Chilean pair.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, of the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and action lines were set for 31 projects among the South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will give "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence."
He reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-priced internet access in all corners of South America, and to deal jointly and efficiently with the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas...uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian president in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the cross-cutting axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The outcome document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace and good relations among neighbours was another issue highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his pair from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute respectfully after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) may have an encounter with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope I can tell him to handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the Defense Ministers of the bloc met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state-run TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He defended, in this regard, the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"Free mobility of citizens and workers must be achieved for any South American country, as already happens for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also expressed his support for the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and instead we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under United States funding," he said in reference to Ecuador's political asylum given to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he is not repentant of that decision because he has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep democratic and human rights values."
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his trial was not respected".
He also criticized the Swedish justice system for requiring him to be interrogated on its territory for an alleged sexual offence when "Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out by videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
What there is is is the danger that his physical and mental health will deteriorate because he is locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"That complicates anyone's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a safe passage that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the lock-up of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances," he said.
And he said, "If Britain gives the safe conduct tomorrow this is over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly permits and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow this problem ends.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lying, which distort freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that these journalists are no longer "the bankers and the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador," and said that if he is re-elected he will "deepen the revolution to continue the right path and direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the agency "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and legal coup" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty, "perfectly pertinent".
At the moment, that failure is not being complied with.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed broadly in order to overcome them and move forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the litigation over maritime limits that they maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and said that "it is correct for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries undertake to accept judgment however hard it may be".
Referring to the eventuality that he will stand as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
Winning would be my last term in the presidency and that's where we get out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse into President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of State participated today in Lima in the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS Deaths Today Cause Late Detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: AIDS positive.
"It was as if I dropped a bomb," he means by remembering the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "softer", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
She decided to take care only of her illness and began to learn about it; with such an effort that she already celebrated her 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived at in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he had a cut."
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG HIV Unit, after referring that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affectation of the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that those who are diagnosed with HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as they stay in control they will be able to live without problems until they are 75 years of age," the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone 255 people died in 2011, with 187 deaths to May of this year; however, it is ensured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had enough medication. The problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their infection status, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a strong piece of information: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, they have to offer massive screening tests, to all people who need it."
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a particular laboratory for testing, only because he had been made by a friend and, despite his young age, he was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm already going to die, I'd better wind up three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take the medicines.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but corresponding, I take care of myself and the other person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
That they are tested, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the battle slogan for AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a top journalist who has taken the case around HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "the condom distribution has actually increased, before we were given one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with sorna and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to expose themselves, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be behind the counters and that those hundred be in public toilet dispatchers at places frequented by young people.
It's not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the chelas and the motel, as the governor Emilio González replied, asking if there would be any distribution of condoms in his Administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV cases).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about one recorded case.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court a ruling that ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt achieved through a commercial contest in Mexico, the scenario sets a bad precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would seem, therefore, that the procedures in support of the survival of the signatures allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In the practical field, the endorsement of the sentence handed down last June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bancarrotas court for the northern district of Texas, leaves the Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of embargoing their properties in beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the trial judge points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal says that the main proceeding is the commercial contest conducted in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial contest the debts owed to its parent Vitro subsidiaries, the required majority to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the Courts of the United States, that is to say the funds "buitre" like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The information is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced since 2008 as a relief from the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, hitting the country’s tails.
For the time being, the signature of the González Sada family will bring a reconsideration appeal before the appeals court itself so that the vote will reach its plenary session, that is, the five judges, since only three of them voted.
If Cerciorare does not succeed, the appeal for review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States, will be sought.
The serious thing about the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Competitions Act, noting that it was released in compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General balance sheet
For several months the complaints placed on the table by the Mexican Aviation Unions against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, have already found the bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the businessman to extract 198 million pesos from the IXE Bank trust F/589 in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're closing in on the Dragon Mart.
Meeting over the weekend in a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with an area of housing to the right for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental coso that swept away part of protected areas and raised the mother of all the amagoes against the industry.
ACTA Died
A demand by the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Forgery Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an infringement of freedom of expression on social media.
Long-term Homex
In an effort to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, Homex housing developer is placing Bursatile Certificates for 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical ones that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
He's born a competitor.
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with a competitive social reason has just been created, whose objective will be the services market of the software clusters of Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 trillion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Battleball has been my life"
Basketball Trotamundos Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of the tabloncillo and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local basketball history as wide as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was as a minor category player, National Superior Basketball player, proxy and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put on many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Battleball has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate by making that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his broad trajectory, testify this way.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, those who treasure with the greatest emotion are those who recall their passage through the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old acting as co-empowerment or proxy of the franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight cowboy championships since 1967, whether as proxy, co-empowerment or leader.
They were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at the BSN.
From then on he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a very strong 6"7" player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember you saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another one.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, because by 1988 it was already more federative.
By that time he preferred to enjoy his executors and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the Pre-Olympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived fourth place and it must have been bronze if it wasn't for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that group from the 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a peel to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Columbus and James Carter young, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90th due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Preolimpico in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the Pan American Mar del Plata mess, we won gold against all odds.
What has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as Piculín did.
And that doesn't count his career in the different leagues he played.
Who's been the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and which in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys only played in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the island in national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of my time music on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman Dies
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarnated an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil tycoon predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995 he was found with a malignant tumor in the liver and had a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast on the NBC network from 1965 to 1970.
In it she played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when she finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-received roles by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful performance of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
CBS's drama series on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars in bookmakers.
He also helped give the series a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it in and turned "Dallas" into the second most watched entertainment show in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to cross her off as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who attempted to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), interned.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only one he negotiated that he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in process, the network reported.
Immediately there was no Warner or TNT pronouncement on how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tested luck on New York theatre stages in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them in any way," she told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant he became a promoter of organ donation and volunteered in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little awkward for a short time, but they're gonna be okay."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Course begins that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clinged as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "debtragedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-of-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) students this week.
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Mediums, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, entitled only "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours," Restall said of his high-average course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - let alone one professor - said he believed in the expiration date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a senior student in Temple, 21, and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin to think immediately about the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end-of-the-world" parties.
"I may call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
