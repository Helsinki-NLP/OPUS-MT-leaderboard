When we are going to die, we will be alone. Of all our earthly possessions we will be about to depart. Earthly friends - friends who point out our position, our wealth or our social qualities, - will leave us when we enter the dark valley. From those bound to us by stronger ties - our relatives, our loved ones, children, brothers, sisters, and others no less loved by us who have been made our friends because they and we are friends of the same Savior, - from them we must also leave. Although not everything will leave us. There is One who "stays closer than a brother" - One who has loved His own who are in the world, loves them to the end.
