The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in ČEZ's shares reached approximately half their value on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of commercial Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday's fall when it dropped to approximately 6%.
The drop this time is due to the fall of shares on Wall Street.
Also here is the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector.
Fall of actions in Asia
The shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges lived on Tuesday a dramatic fall, although throughout the day the index finally attenuated part of the losses.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Stock Exchange index throughout its financial day marked almost four percent, although it later attenuated its losses by reducing the decline by nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange declined by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
Sidney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Secretary of the Index dropped to 3.6 percent.
"The bailout actions planned in the US are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world," said Hong Kong's Chief of the Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, i.e., without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens to make falls felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American stock
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan to which $700 billion (almost SEK 12 trillion) should be devoted.
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks lived a bloody bath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones's index dropped to almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index fell before it was announced, but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal did not go ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
Their vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
American lawmakers caused a gap in talks over the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kroner).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some contract details before they can make public the final form of the law and get it voted on.
The financial system support plan will be discussed Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
He told Reuters on Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Assembly's Committee for Financial Services and Banking.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, it will come to "disenchantment" thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market support will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a breakthrough.
We resolved our dissenting views on the form the market stabilization package should take," Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of legislators met Sunday night with finance minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy from financial companies the unsold mortgage assets that lead financial companies to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and will also have to be effective in the market.
The sanitation plan still needs to be continued, but I think we're already working on it," said Paulson.
A Signal for Asian Businesses
The global financial crisis has an explicit impact on the rapidly declining stock market.
According to Democratic Nevada Senator Harry Reid, legislators are doing everything they can to get Congress to definitely pass a deal this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses in the Asian finance market because these are the ones on the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
For now, however, there is nothing clear for sure about when the two chambers of American Congress will vote and, not even if they will not stagnate at the last moment with any problems.
Lawmakers believe it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush Appreciated the Progress of Meetings
On the other hand, the president may veto this decision but Congress may overcome its veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes the basic idea of the program was retained, which consisted of earning financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg commented.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's advance and that he values "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armoured contract
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, head of negotiators, said legislators decided on the liability of the program's money for protecting taxpayers' taxes from their losses, a easing closure of the scheduled finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the participating companies of the program, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
It would have to be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made a breakthrough towards the agreement that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also includes helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly charges of installments of debtors and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Homeland Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And this is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"Much more important is that, as early as this week, congressmen agree on their support and give their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval should be reached is, at the moment, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Armed fight: the MP3 Player against the mobile phone.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player gets to make calls.
Which seems clear that it's better to just buy the phone.
Yet there are sufficient reasons for man to acquire only the reproducer.
The choice depends practically on the way of its use and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern record player to hear Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on it.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP records no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz, or blues are stacked on their shelves, you're probably dreaming, at least, of this kind of record player.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, i.e. the compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly taste the twenty-crown market helmets.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
Also decides the battery life
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobiles do.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elementary functions such as phone, send messages, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse photography device and can even manage to navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDAs will also have in their pocket a small computer.
This is a small miracle since no fridge knows how to make a barbecue and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile before the display indicator will be illuminated by asking to be recharged.
And the playing of music is one of the biggest energy gulps.
Few mobile phones are able to play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest players) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobiles will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top of that, constantly call get still, for more safety, a loader for work - this is also valid for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, because even the worst endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when recording music on your mobile phone.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly to the memory card but only in some unreduced reader drives can the small memory cards that are used on mobiles be connected.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music via the USB computer.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment, be interested in the strength of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to the music as background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as in the tram, then you will be enough with any mobile that plays.
Which practically gets any real cell phone.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 plays it all and practically all the music you get will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough by means of the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service could by itself be a compelling argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is miserable and the majority is limited only to the topics of fleeting success of the radios.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (either by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always have a cell phone on them.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find your phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends if you always carry headphones or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited to the absence of an entry for classic headphones.
The best ones, even as far as the technical part is concerned, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are actually handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, their handling similar to previous standard cassettes or also to record players is evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile phone and, consequently, huge account for data download.
Which apparatus to decide on
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card it will reach the 2,000 crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are normally equipped only with a card of 2 GB maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive have an 8GB memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) there is no need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding lovers of music, take advantage of the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line mobiles have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, about the four thousand crowns, but with a greater capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and of accumulator (normally 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the most arria brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is already arriving, this year, in the Czech Republic.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is fairly developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
Probably won't be long before he gets here.
That Czech operators are one of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees you will probably come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper than if sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
We probably find this paradoxical, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
Of this also the president of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, has already said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
It is precisely the virtual operator's entry into the mobile telephony market that brought a marked drop in prices to which the classical operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the British market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, there is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we informed you about the release of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
Moreover, behind Mobilking lies the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators lies in the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups.
In addition, for them to function effectively, they have far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators usually profile with low costs - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages which however, is often counterbalanced with the supply of tighter services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half as cheap compared to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a good blow also the bet for a trivial nothing target group.
This operator specifically addresses the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - he is the operator he likes and who he can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as that of Poland could engage in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čenický doubted this: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, from the point of view of the supply of services, it is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," said in telephone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the financial group Penta.
Indirectly he said that current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows this the group GTS Novera that would like to take a step forward to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of clients of companies.
"We have a great interest in this, in order to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony services.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile phone operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe they flash better times.
It appears that, by unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with some complex and serious project in this field," said Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesperson for Telefónica O2.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2's opinion, adds: "Until today we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
He adds, "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that could be studied on such short horizon"
Vodafone's focus is rather on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čenický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this is as far as the sharing of costs and infrastructure is concerned.
We regard it as the greatest contribution from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile."
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition leading to a fall in prices and thus a fall in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull the same rope, proof of that is the grab when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the ČTU was at the time of U:fon's entry by the T-Mobile society.
This is attested to by public information available on the ČTÚ websites.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "In addition, the competitive environment in the mobile telephony market has not long been open to a fourth operator.
As far as the character of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean for him and, above all, for his services great requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tendering, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position on this issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after an agreement was concluded on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator.
Until today no agreement has been closed since the offer of potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for the classic operators," added Kristián Chalupa, from the ÚOHS External Relations Department, to our question.
These statements are no surprise to the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that should represent the interests of consumers, this is more than just a consideration, apart from that, they should note that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Out there where virtual operators operate normally we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the fall in prices of mobile telephony services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of market means and the lowering of prices does not fall within the interest of the ÚOHS.
The dramatic shock in this whole case really lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether this is really a coincidence is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at gas stations because it is clearly the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office has found no signs of unfair competition in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding promotion of responsibility in their market actions.
The tools needed to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunication regulators," added Chalupa to his response.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is clearly an analysis of relevant markets developed by ČTÚ according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge the agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for ÚOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators rise strikingly similarly.
Current complaints from stakeholders (including the GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with operators there are many similar impediments.
Placing responsibility on ČTU is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which ÚOHS washes its hands in this whole matter.
We've met him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law to extend the competence of ČTÚ in the field of commercial tendering was recently tabled but was not implemented, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
The representatives of ÚOHS must know this perfectly well, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
Everything's fine, when no one looks
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator continues to operate unnoticed and a few already exist in Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that put their own prices to mobile telephony services which, however, only a part are public.
These are usually companies that engage in multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Normally only a few chosen get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same ordering a lot of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile phone operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases such as those cited were discovered, one could talk about breach of contract terms that could result in the end of collaboration with the given company," answered the question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile phone operators would not reach responsible people.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned above that they can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make a profit that is not despicable and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čenický warns us of possible problems: "The law allows for speculation of this kind, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot dispose of it as a normal customer of the operators."
This is precisely what should seem to the ČTÚ minimally strange.
There is also a new question for the ÚOHS.
If mobile phone operators lock their eyes on this type of procedure, why block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it it should not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that its commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As was already clear in the text, the virtual operator's entry into the mobile telephony market brought a significant drop in service prices.
At the same time, virtually in all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases have they defended the operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure they managed to get the first virtual operator to emerge and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body has this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience, we cannot fail to be impressed that the confusion of powers in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile market will probably start moving again.
If any of the operators let in a virtual mobile phone operator, it will be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we will perhaps stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one female voice, one with Choir and another instrumental.
The singing is done by Kateřina Knřínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremiš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio already said earlier that it intentionally chose for Solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, also, with the Choir to look at the diction so that the text would be well understood, so that it would be consistent," he commented.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home first played in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in Josef Kajetán Tyl's original Czech play Fidlovačka and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people made it theirs.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The MHD in Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company the date when the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can now be purchased by nearly one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the infocentres and stations of the transport company at Metro stations, Muzeum, M
Bonds can already be purchased from yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than 400 people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about the ticket stalls at subway stations, where until now they had to regularly queue up to take out a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card is charged to one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is at the disposal of the passengers a window with trained personnel that helps those interested with the purchase online and also with the reloading of the voucher purchased on their card," said the project spokesman, Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic voucher at the Opencard on the automatic vending machines found in some metro halls.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket-picking machine and the passengers will probably already have noticed them in the stations of the metro of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter in it the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is to say, on the bypass trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 used mainly by the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
"On the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the area of the voucher", explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
Ringbuses have their reading cards mounted in the driver's locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany him with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Fund.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the voucher.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drapal said.
Passengers who do not travel on bypass buses and do not remember when it is they end the validity of the voucher can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
Southeast wanted to be part of the US in a referendum
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is drawn from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, some groups of Sudeten Germans presumably addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
It results from the letters that are stored in a particular archive and are now stored in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Land Šumava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their heart".
In view of the fact that Czechoslovakia's union with the south-eastern Germans presumably presupposes - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, inconsideration, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors beg in the letter to the American president to assume Šumava for today and forever under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we will be handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all collaborates with the victory of the Allies," it is written in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals from the “Czech oppressors”.
If the President of the United States presumably doubted this idea of the German šumavos, it would be enough to organize in the šumavas lands a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under its patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish to us, according to some specialists it rightly paints the expectations of the Germans of the south-east then.
Although the Czech Germans should have sensed minimally that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudeten some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is even confirmed by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was in the war, as a German from Budějovice, enlisted in the Baltic navy.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought they could use the Czech when they came home," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected that on the basis of the Benes Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way, the emotional campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media could be characterized.
The minister's office, Aleš Łebíček promises that it will deter drivers from dangerous driving.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, the internet and in brochures.
It would have to dissuade the driver from high speed and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also to remind them that before getting started they tie their belts.
It wants to raise the awareness of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and ultimately also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that impinge on emotions.
And to this end, the "bloody" ads attest to us throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "You don't think" is written with big letters on the plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that man in a moment of despair can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "fear" viewers until the year 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises that this will reduce accidents and the death toll on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"The system of sugar and whip is worth the drivers.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says transport psychologist at Na Homolce hospital, Martin Kořán.
And that is why it is necessary an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative publicity, concrete psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is a panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
Israel's interim government president Ehud Olmert spoke about the restitution of virtually all lands occupied in 1967, i.e. the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to restore almost all (occupied) lands if not all of them," Olmert told the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll keep some percent of this land, but we'll have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israel's lands) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of restitution, East Jerusalem would also be included.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or bulldozers to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, sacred and historical place" which is located inside the ancient city.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also mean concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only at the base of the withdrawal from the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to get rid of in order to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with the Hizbulah (Shit movement), they will have to break out of the ongoing support of Hamas (Shit movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) terrorism in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are hostesses on buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises as to whether hostesses and passengers can travel by bus during the trip.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is opposed to the road traffic law," says transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the 22-year-old stewardess died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less safe place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places.
However, the bus may have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the very moment the hostess delivers the coffee or newspapers.
Here the role is played if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with foot places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no places to go standing, which was confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was removed and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat," he told us his position.
The stewardess doesn't know the law.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Even no legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term "Vehicle Reviewer", whose rights and obligations are not defined," says spokesman Hanzelka, less emphatically.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks on the contrary that the law adequately addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have foot sites.
That's it," he says.
Buses are divided between urban ones, where there are places to stand and of limited maximum speed, intercity with places to stand with a higher speed permit and those of long distances without places to stand, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with safety belt.
Like on the plane, says the expert
The BESIP expert on transport safety, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no major problems with the movement of the hostess on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service on the planes.
Even here there is no assurance that the turbulence will arrive and that the stewardess can be hit on the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly slows down obviously physical laws are valid.
Same as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the hostess must be resolved by the carrier's internal regulations," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is not solved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier offering hostesses service.
He employs 200 in it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that job risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess's position is risky, then I will suppress it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, on entering.
It would save even expenses," he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks hostesses in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We have no stewardesses, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
There was a huge tragedy
In the accident of the line linking Naples a young hostess from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, collided with the right front.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the hostess's rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be booked for long distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but waits for the financial expenses also by the culprit's side.
Law reform?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the hostess on the bus in which for a year thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile during the march," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewardesses to be something that threatens the safety of passengers in a significant way," ending spokesman Hanzelka, that the control of safety in buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at work.
The hope of Dusseldorf rests on Frankfurt
In the letter of the board of directors of the West LB bank for its collaborators there is no shortage of great words.
By the merger of the units of the bank of Dusseldorf with the bank DEKA can be formed `a central capital market of the financial group of Sparkassen', as stated in the letter, published on Monday
West LB bank, breaking the `block of competition' with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
Thus he comes to understand the text, when a board of directors wants to show ability to act in hard times.
Because as before the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Institute which has recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the Frankfurt side, much has been said about the union of such a kind between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know from its investment funds, and the West LB.
Indeed, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August let it know that he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB.
But the DEKA board of directors, which is now made up of the regional banks and Sparkassen associations, instructed the board to start negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
In this it could be a business in the capital market or some parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen area appears the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3000 collaborators is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with the Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union went unfulfilled.
As soon as the plans were made public, Hesse's government expressed itself against Helaba's involvement in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead the regional bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba board of directors, said he was against plans for coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of this, it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliament elections are to pass, the BayernLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge it will increase, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could be only a young partner, although so far it stood out much better from the financial crisis than did the Stuttgart and Munich buildings.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans for coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, the Nord LB is the only one left.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it concerns the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro- Verband so far gave no answer.
In the end the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the whole bank
As you can reconcile the coexistence between unique parts of the bank and the DEKA, that will show the time.
Oktoberfest's second weekend is known as "the Italians' weekend"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca as well as the third or fourth.
But this time, he is assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-litre keg of Kaiser-branded beer is built a huge bear tiger showing nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants who know how to produce low sounds in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses leave, `direction Munich, the beer party', expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are especially planned for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are the South Americans singing, they had already started celebrating at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-colored sideburns, owns these buses.
For five years they have been coming to Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way over there, during the day on the meadow, at 22.30 a.m. turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer which was made according to the law of the purity of Bavaria, sickness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Quickly the tranquility reigns on the bus, travellers are sleeping.
All right, well, they'll still need the strength.
He stops for Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registration take another break on the 8 motorway shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group has the expected arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the car park next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his latest speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the tent open, that means marching!" says Marco in the early morning.
"March!" March and occupy the back of the tent.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and everyone with yellow caps don't sit on the same bench, spread out all over the place!"
A liter of beer, Marco roars, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip.
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
He just gets out of his place, he'll be taken!"
Third: "You have to get here this afternoon at exactly half past ten!" Understand?
And now everyone's going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the road, ties the yellow caps on the trees, signs of traffic and even on an election poster of a great People's Party of Bavaria.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It's Oktoberfest's second weekend known as "Italians' weekend"
There are no exact data on the number of people; they are 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police are assisted by seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistances, in front of the English (about 60 assists) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The Italians' favorite campaign store is thus called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück stressed only last week.
Well, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sphere will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's real estate financier, which is listed in the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to resist market turbulence.
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: the credit grants amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to be of interest.
Money comes from private banks as well as public law banks.
The cause of that is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a short period - which is now no more possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of the year the bank's capital reserve in cash has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of own capital has delayed a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continued income from financial investments and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero, the imputation income for debtors and some securities also from the dissolution of provisions of credit businesses tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and high revenue from the repayments of the restructuring compensation costs of the former Depfa group as well as the repayment of interest according to the federal tax code and the businesses organized for the consortium companies, the negative balance could result in a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financier was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as a reason for founding the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be made from the funding of state projects, the Defa began to focus intensively on projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and as well as state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make depreciations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated profit and loss account of the group, it is said very imprecisely.
It's a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By the year 2007 they were cancelled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financier in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own the customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans essentially went down because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of Defa's credit portfolios from its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank with a credit covers the need for group financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international money markets that are now essentially unfit to operate"
Other sources say that thanks to this money refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Institute (BaFin) are on the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That's what the shareholders and creditors of the bank have to wait for.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no constancy.
It is even imaginable that funding should not be needed in its full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be excluded.
Word was that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary salvation cannot reassure at least worried people either.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
The borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts hardly change, borrowing courses according to the position on the property register clearly tend to decline.
The loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are mainly concerned and are therefore borrowings whose maturity exceeds 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its borrowings that were formerly an investment in speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are unaffected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start from early pension repayment.
Or something is going to happen, which no one risks imagining - the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial statization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleep, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put the end to it and use transport to take new account of losses for future pay-back tax payments on change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana High School, the girls started laughing: The German girl is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows Mangas' word - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was afraid.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I go by train 40 minutes to the Highschool Tachibana.
Alone I had to find the way, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not fixed as strictly as at my home in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine to twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the home room.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
In addition, I am not a person who speaks with pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt from the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, dressed like this, I put myself in the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this time I was very happy because I had already started studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and signaled and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I knew her from my Sleeves.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "nice, cute."
Then I slid quickly into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I felt really assaulted.
They all spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand English as Japanese.
Then at recess they all took out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu dough.
In most cases I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new flavor.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marinated plums in the salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in hopes of getting to know him better during a recess.
That's what I read about in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see him here too.
"Why precisely Japan?" asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
Finally for years I prefer to read Mangas.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a skinny by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a harsh, disciplined and traditional country.
Since everything is well organized, I still didn't feel lost here although Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling danger flees, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can one control if they, acting in the same way as we do, feel the same way?
The contributions of famous scientists have been published in an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to prove it so far, although we can't even prove that other people are conscious.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains present the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include the questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same as the other animals: he plays dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to spread our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and executive functions leading conduct).
This large part is much more developed in the case of people than that of the other primates and seems to be missing absolutely in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to suppose that even man differs from the other primates.
One other particularity is found in man's linguistic nature: As most of his experience is linked with the tongue, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals can be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on the tongue, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created however, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the consenting experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing happens more to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what results from that for sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
Seen from this point of view the sensations are very fixed to part of the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature they follow classifications of fine sensation because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others in pair with ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the other hand, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for the bodily feelings and the brain stem, as Jaak Pankseep thinks, but concentrates more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretic reasons I can't go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control if rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same way?
Seeing danger, a cockroach flees, because it's afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior still does not prove the similarity of experience.
That is true that the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even when it is possible to test it for men: How can you test it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats rather than emotional sensations because their sensations supposedly differ fundamentally from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and to the tongue).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here, while the same is measured for rats and men.
Since I don't investigate the tongue and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You can say I don't see beyond my nose, but I'd rather move forward than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said the preparations would soon be made under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government views UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as the confidence test of Ukraine's ability to organize the European championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is much to do."
The hours of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries are lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed," said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA is not going to take our eyes off us."
In Poland a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that preparation for the 2012 European championship will not suffer from that."
In the last season alone many clubs in the first division were convicted due to downward manipulation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's Counterattack Indignant
She wanted to promote a new film, talk in an interview about private life—and have problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The backward war of the two roses in Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's ex-partner: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "inaudit that Meg how often she tells the story of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old said to "New York Daily News."
Among other things, it is very "unfortunate" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "remember in public the pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is remarried and recently is a twin dad.
And so he ends up with his statements emphasizing: "Whatever my life is, it goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is fine."
Prices for air tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008 airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Air tickets and overnight stays in hotels were made cheap again - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company has analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a big change in the second semester.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased on average to 6.9 per cent between January and March.
From April to June prices already dropped to 3.6 percent compared last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause that "the interests of American tourists in traveling declined."
The decline in hotel prices is also much more evident in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Because of the rise in kerosene prices, Economy class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, airline ticket prices in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, dropped on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, falling to 23.6 percent in the second half.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even fell by half.
The cause of the price change is on the one hand the rise of the weak economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the airline travel market demand is falling.
On the other hand there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalises aircraft traffic between the US and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit distance flights on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankrupt - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still doesn't go out to make the eleventh goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed by making a goal.
Everything he meant exactly by reacting to what happened, he could read clearly from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled at the booth entrance of Hamburg Stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was almost three decades physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys very great reputation as one of those who were part of the group.
That's why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded his head and raised his fingers in nod.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg's head coach.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that wasn't done.
"Today wasn't all nice to see," added Marcell Jansen.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show its full strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
This Monday the Hamburg SV will be 121 years old.
On Saturday it will be the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," Marcell Jansen said.
It foresees that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the speed of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its forced players late as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the scorer Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to come together, but still the team cannot shine with their successes.
"We need more feeling and dribble," Jol demands.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the banks' salvation package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest loss of points for a day in its history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
Around 20:30 one of the most important stock market barometers in the world reported a deficit of 5 percent in 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and stood at 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs Bank shares lost nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a big investor Warren Buffet had been financially involved in the company.
The salvation plan foresees making available resources to buy so-called "muddy" mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid at once if not step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive the share option receipts for financial associations that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state's cash.
Action courses in Europe and the USA continue to fall
One billion aid to banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The course of the shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate drops and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the state's projected saving of the financial market, the US Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the saving actions of the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier's action a period of time lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and reported a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5,839 units.
All over the world, financial markets fell.
The opening of Wall Street Day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion salvation package will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent until it was 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the salvation project, Senate voting may be the first of October.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mystery phenomenon has caused the researchers to be disconcerted: Dark Matter influences the speed of the space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity may not be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent nearly 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of the space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example of the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Ulysses Sun probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100% as expected according to the venerable law of gravitation.
More like frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have a higher or lower speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity which describes the pull force of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, solemnly believes now as before Einstein did not confuse and attempts to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained of astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter which may also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known the existence of Dark Matter only for ten years.
Supposedly it possesses the pull force and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially also any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As Italy's foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of ransoms.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations have already begun.
The Germans always fall back to the kidnappers' point of attention.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper reports on the most important cases.
Apparently European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are free.
The same information about this is presented by Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news about the release on Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'Now we control your state of health,' Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, reports state Egyptian television.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on the way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the hostages were released: According to descriptions by an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers have killed six kidnappers and two of them have detained in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom from Germany in the amount of six million euros; the money had to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Stepfather abuse "lead to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an inquiring study, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs Rande had said about her, who after having been a great surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "resigned to life."
In April 2007 his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating through a plastic bag.
Mr Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter concluding: "I used to tie her up and sell her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more clearly, if she hadn't, the issue probably wouldn't have ended in court."
He added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged for data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip by the Ministry of Defence, abandoned two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
Surely this is the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intent to commit a crime.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner reported that the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause referring to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the officer must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately transferred from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face B&B price
In Britain construction companies could face a price of more than £80,000 after the rescue/salvation of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The Government did indeed provide £14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank's 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using savers' money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humiliating" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley's mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest accruing in the meantime is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450,000 in 2009.
This means that societies will have to recover £81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general director of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction societies and their members from what could be a relevant price," added Mr. Cole.
Interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which may be almost twice as high.
Being the mutual construction companies organizations and without having shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk rises from five pence per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pounds a liter since next Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pence in February and then the investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the higher price of milk had increased before February, was in 2002.
Bail denied to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the application for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison upon return to her country.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several allegations of corruption in his charge.
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's government, supported militarily, first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she will return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina holding that she could not obtain bail because she was already on treatment abroad on parole," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will file an appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, according to what an Awami League leader said last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, backed by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for the anti-polio campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to take advantage of a recent campaign to immunize against poliomyelitis due to Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or obstructed thousands of officials while conducting vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision forcing the company to reduce its shareholding in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its share of ITV from 17.9% below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests hindered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB purchased its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of the ITV stake raised doubts about ITV's independence, and urged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin's boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligor to reduce his package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, said BSkyB, he would have handed over his voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of American lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators, and former Produrator General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Severe allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But it was later learned that the lawyers had not been evaluated worse than their colleagues, and many observers concluded that the dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, resigned his position.
A number of other DOJ officials did the same.
The Attorney General's report is very critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the matter, and underlines how he had a "primary responsibility" for dismissals, who "abdicated" his leadership position and was "notably non-collaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic Bat Out Of Hell anthem.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said obtaining this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, constituted the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
Coldplay's group are running the nominations for this year's awards and qualifying the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the standings.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell remained about nine years in the rankings and came to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for her cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It subsequently emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply serviced.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of the Primiera Street – before I found the Second Street – between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alleyway more than one active track.
No sign.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on Primera Calle
that wants to resurgent Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-fashioned neighbors who commented that they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block's past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At this month's meeting of the Community Committee on Land Use Venture, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, Community District Manager n.3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to possess Extra Place," said Ms.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to guarantee public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is the development of property rather than the management of that.
Compared to its more colored surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided between his sons and this narrow strip of land was claimed by no one.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest as they are, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a slash of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk of the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead end alley, dark also by the day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with old weeks' newspapers blown along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat curryed through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and which now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz bottle of beer were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that it could be cleaned.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet, and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a tough business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are the example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English in the classroom, is effective in nullifying the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
At this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income families:
more than a third of students, many of whom have just arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated in the 2008 math exam.
And almost an equally amazing 93 percent has mastered English language testing and arts.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than what Mr Obama favored.
The Sixth Street school emphasizes review and practice, the constant evaluation of competencies and does not tolerate any excuse attitude.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main one on Sixth Street, the school's approach to teaching English to students is in "total immersion."
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Mrs Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like this one who has arrived from Mexico and that, if you enter the classroom 12 months later you would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of his party's politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and his same constant support for dark bilingual education the prediction of Mr Obama's response.
While it is that immigrants should learn English, Mr Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English
and instead, he said, "you must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider well-working education models rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil fell sharply this Monday because of concerns that the American bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Crude oil shares fell by 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning negotiation at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped from over $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before falling back, once again, because of the huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors, once again, on Monday, despite congressional leaders who said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, at the hectic weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement "seem not to have been able to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for global equity, interest and exchange rates are going to be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the coming year, such as oil consumption falling due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for a reduction in the price of oil and gas is 20 percent by 2009.
Second insanity room: team sets record
Having spent, for the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in Jets' uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw things unfold in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed an unscored game into a deflating game.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis commented.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the dark clouds.
At this time it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles performing a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one when one cornerback fell and another came in with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a one-player devil.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were at the dam, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced into foul by Warner.
On the last turn, Bowens's misdemeanor could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a final 34-0.
They're the biggest points the Jets ever made in a room.
To the team coach, Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second quarter much more than the terzero.
They have earned a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebrselassie rested tops his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown why many consider him the greatest runner in history, surpassing his own world record in the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the well-to-do flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has smashed by 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, won last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the race against the clock to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since when track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become at long distances, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered cramps in the calf two weeks earlier and that he had lost a week of training.
Clearly, the suspension left him fresh, not rusty.
"I am very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-East rival - for the style of orchestrating too much of his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began defying Gebrselassie after his pacemakers decreased.
But shortly before three miles from the finish line, Gebrselassie picked up one last impulse to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his personal best record by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi reached third place in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a notable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games so she was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her staff best record in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculus run, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to do headlong and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place at 2:21.31, while Kenya's Elena Kiprop finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proofs of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and childhood place of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a jail."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression Season Federal Writers Project – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural Black people in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and who does not know what is missing."
Even now, in the year when a Black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to starting a dialogue on the race issue, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of almost 2,400 people living under a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black South - sometimes scorned, sometimes praised - that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road running through downtown Florida often forgotten inwards the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a cement face both in life and in literature, Mrs Hurston took her readers to Eatonville's first mayor's property store, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road on the left," he wrote, "there is the modern Maron public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitory rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls who Mrs Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still today prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcasticly.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin continues.
But, she adds, swinging in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think his contribution to the world or his heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the ’80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street of the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had resulted in the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys were going around town throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next to it," Mr.Franklin said.
"They killed a girl, too, once.
They threw him at a watermelon in the car."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court which, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honoring my race."
A Residents today say that the dissegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - it was customary to hug the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because it was white - there's a cultural divide there," Mrs Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors, and artists who went over prejudices, just as she did, with buoyant, confident, and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs Hurston's anonymous grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, a acclaimed biography of Mrs Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her into American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was again under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put on what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride," Mrs.Nathiri said.
Mrs Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the same city.
People from outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new library (bearing Hurston's name, of course) opened in 2006, on a resurgent and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, you can sometimes feel like on a street of the past in a summer rain, in a town as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Outsiders who come in search of Eatonville's history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A An advance permission is necessary to do most interviews, and some things - such as murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that their island community gives may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all problems, no better, no worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,'" says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stand up and take a moment to look at its history, it's a very nice city."
Around here, in New York, everyone's talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not notice finding themselves in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bee nest offices that lie above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face daily the worst "bad day of the office" since the 1929 downfall.
Home delivery guys continue to resound their metal tea carts across sidewalks and carry muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between loaded apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 eccentric shirts stamped on a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning meal, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on business days.
Employees still wait in line for their bagel to the vendors' carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 and 5 p.m. on the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there are, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase affiliate, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "personal banker of trust," and were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they had been commuted, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the Isle of Staten.
They had taken their money out of the so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction society), from the credit unions and savings banks of their hometown whose gills only function within the state of belonging, and which claim to treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The office and store workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become finance experts in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her distressed-looking executive director, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter with familiarity as if complaining about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-something janitor in uniform from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my grocer shopping.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
Switching is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for freedom in Austria and Philip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated with the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry signs of traffic representing mosques with a red line passing through.
The police are blaming extreme right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in Traun Cemetery, near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but investigators think this may have occurred because of the attempt to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way election-related.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim religious when the month Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that hogged nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, and also expressed opposition to foods considered to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brother" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties try to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing policy of Islamization in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban abroad for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from travelling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by counsel Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr.Paul Gadd's travel abroad as he did to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, on account of being under the sex offender register.
He has to inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss Glitter's individual case or possible location in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said, "Kent Police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said, "Kent Police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's inhabitants is Kent's main concern and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably reached Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Home Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and glad to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I catch the master out of the picture to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no fliers, no premiere outfits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
Move aside the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments outside the public, when to find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, carefree because they will not go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the program of the Month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With the flavor of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical base of the image, conferring modernity on it, an idea that reflects Bauer himself's understanding of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dancing, singing or playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the goblin that becomes visible in a way of feeling, of being and of being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Photómata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits displayed in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to meet them and to be able to enter a moment in their life, be it a long or short moment.
I think that within photography portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or confront people, characters, who sometimes don't know, or who leave you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people", is exhibited at the Galería El Photómata, located at number 20 on Calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit it until the 16th of October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a recklessness"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to taking forward the new project in which he works, a novel with Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize winner of Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that occupies him today "is a recklessness" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If I were sensible, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the word festival and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the writer most voted by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend", filled the capacity of the theater Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated audience to whom it was made very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extrorific adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "live more than he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined manner" to supplement his "lack of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and remaking a lot; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are based.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more dissatisfied," so he asked writers "not to give up on frivolity" and "to assume responsibility" their vocation.
Climatology undermines the Pozoblanco fair that also runs out of fences
The festival of fences that closed the subscription of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the announced rejoners that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The inclement weather has been primed with this fair, as finally two of its three festivities have not been held.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bullfight.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a lockdown of Castilblanco
So, only Friday was a celebration.
In him, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out on the shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante paid his two stumps with greetings and an ear, which granted the layings more than his bullfighting.
Even worse was El Juli, who went through the Llanos coso without pity or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief effort, he won a big part of the audience’s anger.
They skip a checkpoint in Álava in a van with 2,000 kilos of hashish.
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
The officers stop the two occupants of a van and they start the flight.
Its load, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
The officers persecuted and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A.A.J., as reported in a statement by the Basque Government's Department of the Interior.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control at the N-1, on their way through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, speeded up sharply and overstepped control.
The officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometres later at the arch, when its two occupants fell off to flee to the race through a forested area.
The ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bales, and they moved to police premises for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials found that the license plate had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the van's documentation, so the arrested person has also been charged with a crime of forgery of public documents.
The Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as has been said, and determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A.J., was transferred to police units for appropriate proceedings and will be brought before the courts within the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under the Effects of some Medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers as she attempted to leave her parking lot in Montecito, according to a California Highway Patrol spokesman who has revealed to People magazine.
The witness detailed that at about 4.30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping deep on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and backward, and as he went back he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who had apparently not initially recognized the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and leave the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to the officers at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of some substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison at around 7 p.m. but was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making favorable deals to family members.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said on the performance that the party will have to adopt with which until now councillor in the Sevillian council.
However, the leader of IU argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities Silva might have committed: "IU has always advocated that this type of matters have the highest degree of transparency."
In the same vein he stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'May Blood', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish uprising against the French in May Blood, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with nearly 15 million euros in budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría leading a large cast of performers.
Blood of May, with a film exceeding two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in cinemas, to become the future in a mini-series for Telemadrid of more than four hours duration.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this filming "a childhood dream", which should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to film a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set up with the decorations and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "a stumped Spain that was wrong as boss to fight for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not have funding such as that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of Blood of May-, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes reflected in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Restarting, has influenced what is his usual form of work, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before the start of the filming and to those who do not cast, because he seems "humiliating" and considers that "part of the director's profession lies in going to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in Sangre de Mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranlaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
An Oscar candidate on four occasions - of which he won one-, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood of May itself, Seven tables of French billiards and the finally selected, Blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be made known", he said.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you're content to make one more film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillana dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer is going to honor a Sevillian dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I found it incredible."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell her life but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" tangos.
His dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one in his shows, as he did in the one of "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever her student was.
"Matilde makes Tortola the oldest, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have agreed to act in my work and I am very honored by it."
The montage also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the cante of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all its extension, and who are always in love with them."
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all of Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have enormous influence at a certain time and now no one knows and much less values her work," Bayón says.
The show will start today at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Recent Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Museum House of the Nobel and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Chop of Light", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, is planned to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
In addition, the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Recent Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of malice", and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and all of America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look, they had a hard time giving him an Oscar.
And that he was retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
It's still been a sledgehammer for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of their existence."
No one was afraid to make a fool of themselves or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the floor, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and well few beings left to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and earned causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his firstborn died of overdose to his home and organic food brand.
A real gift to a country that has had a hard time overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not a man had died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was no less than the summit of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left the bar very high for us all," observed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the demand for probity and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But some try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but was then married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he was surely left with the chances of not being so.
"But why would I eat hamburger out of the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as the devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that an Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race was called, and in my opinion it was the worst race with a lot I've ever been in.
A plethora of nonsense which, of course, if I were to consider it as an evaluation and examine it, would be a very clear suspense.
But let's go piece by piece and from the beginning.
Misuse begins with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go first.
Which I don't think is bad, but if they already make you go to give everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first nonsense, go just for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the t-shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or have they decided to buy only small T-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper because of the crisis?
Well, things like this are a minutiae compared to those on the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue when arriving is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes lasted the wait, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by conatos of popular rebellion and assault on the hut.
I think that about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some of them like me, won't even show up with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn't mark my way out correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect career, it would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft has shown a breakthrough in a new human image recognition and interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) attending to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a recognition system of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and tells him that he will take care of him shortly.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week there has been much talk about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial basser, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it'll be for less.
A find considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome went online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for hardware and software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but we must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more attention to the web browser.
The computer is booted only to run the Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and that they are finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft's employee break rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soda machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive in early 2009 but in the end, rather pulling 2010.
In Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is getting more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to pass bill.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the uniform of the musculated gay parish.
And if we go to list star appearances, we can go back to the image of that strong, pointed mustache who was lifting weights in a traveling circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men's indoor shirt in cotton, tight and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the Anglo-speaking call, but Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all others.
First of all, by its name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable) that the most emblematic T-shirt models wear as detail on their necks.
And pay attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its tank tops.
It also includes collection sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine t-shirts, babes, mini shorts...
Wears designed for underwear comfort.
It's a shame to leave them as underwear, though.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mom; I don't care about the candidate"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is tiny but full of vitality.
Today the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they're much more than some beautiful, famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango makes in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, he wins in the short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but, at the same time, exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango based on in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 1950s and 60s; that's where we get a lot of references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch women as they are dressed, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot of ties in common.
As a child I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to dig into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of the way I dressed.
You know that dancers like to make us our style for classes and rehearsals, to look at us in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you get the wardrobe is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You've turned 30 not long ago, are you in crisis?
No way.
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that women are made, have experience and taste life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not scared of the biological clock.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I'm going to be a mother because my body asks me to be a young mother, and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movies, you're looking forward to several premieres you shot last year.
That's right, and I'm already looking forward to the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it cannot be.
I look forward to the release of 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of Christ's Grave'.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you made your debut on a catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on a catwalk to be a model.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - was auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi's tender heart.
So many things are said about her that, I who know her, would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm keeping that good part where she gets involved.
He asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if he asks me to do the pine, then so too.
To benefit the women of the third world, whatever it takes.
Alcoholic recidivist drivers must install the ‘alcolock’
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the drunk vehicle, or if it is not blown.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the Attorney General's Office, according to which it is a one-year pilot project.
The aim is to reintegrate the driver, and the driver will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the General Prosecutor of Segurida Vial, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Car Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving take the car back.
The alcolock would prevent it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in breathed air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow abtes; or when an alcohol concentration is detected it is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than €1,000 and would be borne by the offender.
In this regard, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce violations by up to 65% during the first year of implantation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with such conduct before it results in criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform through criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been piloted in some commercial and public service vehicles.
It is precisely tomorrow that the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the scheduled time in the program, landed in the presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez airport of Mexico DF the Spanish air force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver about the street, if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very well, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar for the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 soldiers of the navy who interpret the saving of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, mane to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps had been told that in the DF was threatening storm.
They give a smile and a short stop to the photographers before going to the hall where the official procession awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the city's four grand, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The best gifted award of fashion
There may be no place in the most appropriate world to present a fashion award, for Paris and possibly no more exquisite living designer and bont to live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Butón-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new talents of fashion.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in Mango's shop window at number 54 of the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried of emotion.
By the way, it is the firm's second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for chairing the jury of the competition, led us to end up at a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with his heart broken with sorrow and acting of guts heart, by the recent death of his brother, put on a costume of the House and some dressings of ELAH, which cut off the breath, and of the arm of his son Luis - a cannon of almost two meters in length - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner tribute.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because he had both lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the shop with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner was transformed into a long black sexy dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she, recalling other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a 'grand plie' amago.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the walk around the palace premises, but before he showed us on the mobile phone pictures of his son.
The next morning we were able to rejoice in the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon that travels by bike - and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked, that there should be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the antistress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And if that were not enough, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine being enveloped in the agitated rhythm imposed by today's life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection with the world of work.
No, the number goes up to, nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to each one's taste and minutes.
The antistress work is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores by the hand of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Talking asleep
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not talking about those who wake up very wide-eyed by telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while asleep.
The first time it happens maybe you're scared, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder called somniloquis.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more regularly (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines their occurrence.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime enuresis (beeping asleep) or sleepwalking, but it doesn't have to be like this.
As mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation situations.
Anyway, it's a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be useful to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any question that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him exit in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress condition).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children who find it hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain internal calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once the somniloquia appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his dream.
Even if he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes, you should consult or find out what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most usual), do not fall into the temptation to ask him an interrogation to extract information from him.
You will get nothing, because being asleep is not conscious enough to organize his thought.
Moreover you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, with which much care is taken in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions that you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even kidding.
That creates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on their field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goal occasions and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who brushed the squadron with a shot from afar, Illhaeusern quasi was to take "power" and by turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the toe or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we did not let the midfielder pass and left only Riahi in attack position.
The beginning of the second half was crucial, first with two goal occasions from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the scoring opening for the Illhousiens with Marais' goal, well placed to pick up the rejected ball in a first attempt from Diebold (53').
But the scorer Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return in the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who stepped back a bit to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after a major fart, the ball passed very close to the cross-field.
Sarkozy finds the fishermen furious
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a rodeo through Brittany.
In the face of the demonstration of resistance by the fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the president of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet its representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and expect him " to come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " set up by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the increase in diesel prices, which sets a record at 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors."
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce circulation in the Morbihan and the Calvados, which have thus caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been put on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Mancha coasts, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of trading vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Donges Total refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting this Wednesday that will take place to the ministry to think of possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the national fisheries committee, which did not sustain their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris " , announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial equilibrium point of a ship can be reached only with a diesel at a price of less than 0.30 euro per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of " Two Men and a Fate " has died from cancer, at the age of 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who has passed away at age 83.
Embraer maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
The fourth world aeronautical builder, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, reaffirmed Embraer president Fredrico Fleury Curated.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been bailed out by the US monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of repaying its loan of $85 billion, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this newspaper says.
The AIG board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of the AIGs are intended to be separated including its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity available to repay its loan of 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the American authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the proper proportion among the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, a loss never seen on the Stock Exchange of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index dropped from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past 17 September 2001, that is the day on which exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, a technological dominant, dropped 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the expanded (extended) Standard & Poor's 500 index to 8,81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives denied US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he was asking for.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of the FTN Financial.
"This shows to what extent the market had this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days will arrive "too late".
"If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the American central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, head of Economy and Finance at the Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, " every passing day the collapse of a financial institution is announced " in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, that shows that markets face "not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis," added the Financial FTN analyst.
The bond market rose dramatically.
The performance of the 10-year treasure bond fell by 3.632 %, against 3.827 % on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4.161 %, against 4.357 % on the eve.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House happened another to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen considers that John McCain's performance, though honorable, was not "quite "brilliant" to allow him to curb his decline in polls five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published on last Saturday grants five points of advantage for Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who went well.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama won with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them grant the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the good performance expected of his candidate member, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The septuagenary McCain highlighted his undisputed foreign policy experience, underlining his adversary's "genuity" on these issues that were at the heart of this first confrontation.
" Senator Obama does not seem to understand that... " he accused on several occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican televised advertisements.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without being baffled, he was concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama, has already done so," he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television advertisement that reproached the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans."
" During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama reported, yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a harsh rain.
He did not say the words "middle class" or "workers." "Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable character to save the economy that is on the brink.
"Next week could be a decisive episode," he estimated, yesterday, influential and democrat Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama ' s " good economic instincts " with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final eight-year consequence of a bad economic policy put in place by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that he would nevertheless come to reduce taxes from 95% of Americans despite Wall Street shocks, the Illinois Senator also noted that the realization of eventual energy independence from the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudents, both candidates dodged the issues that related to the $700 billion financial rescue plan (€470 billion) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative ones.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the polling stations in Minsk's central square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative ones.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, he has to resign".
Some acknowledge that they have not voted: "for what, since they will do what they want with my vote", says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put foreign observers in a good face in order to renew contact with the European Union is prepared to effect democratic change.
The sanctions, including l'interdiction of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
"We have been put beside the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of the votes," lamented Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate of the opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it is the executive power.
If some opposition deputies enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But his entry into parliament may mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and bills. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) favoured manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Question Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of two last political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five deputies from the opposition to parliament, those who are best suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the central electoral commission welcome his success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday its 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again been one of the safest and most effective providers of blood in the world.
And above all, he regained the public's confidence that had been seriously wavered by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public discontent, the government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that such a disaster should no longer occur.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of reports from Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
" In 1998, when Héma-Québec began her activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence ", he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that " trust is extremely fragile " .
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations in the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which when we do not know and when a serious illness can emanate from that, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we put in place measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense. "
A much more sensitive HIV screening technique appeared on the market in 1999: Nucleid acid tests that make it possible to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleid acid tests allowed the period to be shortened between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than one week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing it and that we will not be able to detect them.
These improvements led to a significant reduction in the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"That means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I think you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion today to recover your health without worry," says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, as an example of the western Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary said before stressing that, in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for adequate supplies.
" The needs increase because the population ages.
Since more aggressive cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the network of blood donors which groups on average only 3% of Quebeces eligible for blood donation. "
All people in good health, 18 years old and who meet the eligibility criteria can however donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors need to be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain it and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since today's life is very rampant, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating his blood," Francine Décary grieves.
With a budget of $297 million a year, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye balloons and skin that is almost exclusively used for the large burned ones.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered as biomedical waste is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We celebrated a few weeks ago the placing on the bench of our thousandth blood sample of the umbilical cord and it is expected to take out more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year ", explains Dr. Décary who describes this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this ", as Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact on the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the USL first division qualifier series, thanks to a 3–1 victory (4–3 in short ends) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at 90° minute of the game.
After the first goalless time from nowhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goal occasions.
Roger Levesque was the only one to disrupt Matt Jordan by the Sounders.
Let us remember that during the first game of the round-trip matches series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2–1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3–1 in the game back to take him by 4–3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semifinals by 5–4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief – Kovalev's victorious goal
Canadian's number one trio is willing to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3–2 win from the Canadian to the barrier free throws opposite the Florida Panthers, last night, at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play to the fullest in the first half, scored Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
Prime Minister does not rule out running elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected during today's by-election.
To reject the limits of our last great northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force staying in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media like during the electoral period.
The prime minister thinks that the elections will take place this fall, although he made it appear that his schedule was very full.
The "North Plane " is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister nevertheless limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel to the immense potential", but did not give a term, amounts of investment, nor precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " according to Mr. Charest ' s enumeration.
This twice-large territory like France is our house, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home to us, but it is in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the flood into gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it's our future," he added, having taken a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of the Quebec territory, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line in which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government ", he said.
In addition, "with climate changes, we must rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the Northwest passage, which will open every year due to ice smelting.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuites?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly the youth.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec party of Ungava), have already started consultations around thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role started some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting at which " a common vision will be given " .
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan "will be agreed, orderly and environmentally friendly " , he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring weekend themes, which began on Friday with a big cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at party power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rebaptize the Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adelard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the subject of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows him to do.
He stressed that his schedule was nevertheless full, particularly because of a federation council mission in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no difficulty in being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec calls in particular for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they would have the right of veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcomed the broad lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Québec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, coming to power in 2003, resigned from applying it.
If he had done so, "we would make progress today" said Mrs Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The Quebec Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what you want, is that this is not just a show," commented leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of the "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
Dishonor this woman who fought incessantly for justice and deserves all our admiration for what she says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the events that are recriminating him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, refuses its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhuman conditions.
The only one who stops with false justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are supporting the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to ensure that he enjoys the benefit of an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, certainly forever after so many years of exactions.
We still don't realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," that's the word Harper continues to repeat and that doesn't make sense.
The time has come when no morals exist anymore: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far minority wants (what will happen after October 14 ?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world attempted a six million euro defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to theirs?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Tactics, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold had truly wanted a public debate, it was in front of public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by beatings.
It was therefore sufficient for the mining company to open its books, its records and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can call for a "public" debate by scorning his views?
According to the vice president, it seems that this word refers only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who holds the authors and editors of Noir Canada does it above all because it rejects the brutal way of the mining company.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but on the basis of civilized changes of arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution-bite (persecuting the " public debate " ), Barrick Gold has just filed a request regarding the authors of Noir Canada urging them not to use this word anymore.
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to hold a debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the pain of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by Noir Canada's authors.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he does not want to engage in a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It provides in particular for better monitoring by the elected parties of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized from non-payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the leaders of the companies assisted.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It's the fundamental point: if we don't do this, trauma, chaos and disruptions on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that a new failure in the mood of investors would cause.
The last hour they had set was the opening of markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who have late joined the negotiations, were rather favorable to the agreement, not forgetting however to squeeze their discontent of being forced to reach this limb.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow the owners to retain their domicile and the one on the wages of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, Interrogated on another network to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
" The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable."
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the dubious debts, the risky and unsaleable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a housing bubble that first led to the sinking of risk mortgage credits before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a sluggishness of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of Republicans elected that had changed the first draft agreement, last week.
We believe that we have emerged from the impasse since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only secured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to smooth out the roughness for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to make losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would aim to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which a further 100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote on the part of Congress.
Instead of its aid, Washington will get stakes in the relief companies that will pay dividends in case of profits and that will be able to resell when the storm will be passed.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the embargo procedures concerning housing obtained from real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is not yet sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest this project yesterday, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Commission, told his constituents that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand."
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that consists of profiting from taxpayers."
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred professors of economics, among whom three Nobel laureates wrote to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to be taken," he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had renounced buying its competitor in bankruptcy since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain."
During this time, on the other side of the Taint, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than 41 billion euros (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue eyes for so long represented his triumph.
The American actor with a lovely smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have taken him away from the record of power held by the true sacred monsters.
What a great back runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, 83 years old, from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast years.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he resembled much and who was long regarded as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes children magnificent.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No ego inordinate, last quality mark.
Because in it was projected an entire country in love with the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied the dramatic art at Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who militated for civil rights was also the auto pilot who qualified in second place in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, folded by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the spectacle scandals that we do not know very well, also disappear with him.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused the vertigo to the cinephiles this weekend, while their big roles are entangled on the black screen of memories.
More than a half century of the seventh American art in perpetual moving parades through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata over the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoked his sensitive lord Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone into the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic manga in the sumptuous film The Sting (The Hit), Oscar to the best film in 1973.
Bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final godfather role of the Irish Mafia on Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curly.
Contrary to several film legends that abandoned the race quite soon, Newman stayed a long time in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its fastos and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " the underplaying " and that judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young man than of marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose features reflected rebellions.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed sides of his true public sensitivity not very well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated to him his 1984 film Harry and Son, play of modesty and sadness.
" Among the numerous tributes that took place yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) claimed, very saddened: " my life and my country were better because of their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his career as a legend, he also hides a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against Hollywood excesses.
We will have seen a lot of its face reign over the jars of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it started as a gag.
The profits from these sales were given to his Foundation for Childhood in Distress.
Newman, rather than contenting himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing frauds of significant damage, in a business way, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Office of the Prosecutor, they used the funds obtained in the public tenders for their own purposes, often justifying the performance of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in their entirety some 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal and in part in the pocket of private persons.
The method, which was also made known by the investigators, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public competitions with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the different associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices were false.
For this purpose they obtained the checkbooks in the Józsefváros District market and the circular stamps were manufactured in the town of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the forged invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Sides.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and these served as a model for drawing up the invoices they presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City of the Capital.
These invoices were signed mostly by István Lados and his accomplice András
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people do not fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
As a hostel in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however on the bill there were one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of big fantasy invoice also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the book store of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and showed him the invoices, he already knew that they were false documents.
"On the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems he also did not agree that according to the bill a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which there are not so many people.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers also did not report that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that on the cash payment bill they foolishly indicated a journey within Hungary as service, which did not coincide with the agency's practice of issuing invoices.
Furthermore - as was known during the investigation - VAT was also included in the document, despite the fact that travel outside the territory of the European Union was exempt from taxes.
Among other things the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the hotel employees only issued machined invoices however the invoice was manual.
In addition the "dispatchers" also made other mistakes, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also by formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvany, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued such invoices.
Nor did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation, therefore the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
Cognizantly issued invoices
Another group of false invoice manufacturers consists of those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapitvany Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the prosecution - was convinced by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
In the same way he collaborated with Zuschlag and his accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices worth approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, without real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, as they then cancelled the prepared invoices but forgot to place this entity in their documents.
The following group of false invoice manufacturers includes those with some connection to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Ivan Kubatov was the demander of the Ukrainian manager of the fictional-based Delta Trio SL in Budapest, which dealt with the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft., which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Iván Kubatov should have also dispatched documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices for Atlasz, Hoppa and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvany on behalf of the company, charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually functioned because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generació.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to various entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecution found that Kubatov received VAT and 10 per cent of the amount of invoices.
That man even took advantage of the company in commandeer Szi-Beri to issue fictitious invoices used in the contest of Biztos Pont.
The Y-Generació and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the contest they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
In order to keep this from being discovered, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably report in the trial - as they did in the prosecution - the course of counterfeiting invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the defendant János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this he has not done so to the present.
The question is: what interest does it have in doing so?Because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him to have Zusi assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he applied for house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no chance for that.
Overlay psychology: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological - economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists attempted to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in an auction and in the meantime the active areas of the brain of the people involved in the experiment were examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI).
In both games the participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, when losing the game the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex was intensified.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self prize" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in betting is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To base their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
In addition to that, another group was promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 prize.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one triumph was highlighted and for the other failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so now we come to a third explanation" - established Andrew Schotter, professor of the faculty of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
Around 500 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 are treated because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses dependent on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperm, vagina humor, saliva).
Travelers are advised to protect themselves by means of a vaccine against the A and B virus, against C there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifests by a general poor condition, weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea.
After this, jaundice appears in the skin and in the white of the eyes, the excrement becomes clear, the dark-colored urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year, one million people die in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected patients receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most people who are infected do not know that they are ill because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and many times the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Premature examination, systematic medical monitoring is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who carry tattoos.
There are now some 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease is cured if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so you can suppress the infection and prevent the cancer.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less for those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in what way it influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
In the framework of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in the series of researches in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate.
The analysis occurred as follows; they fixed a sparkling instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their eyes on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of 17th century Sassoferrato and the Lady of the Armiño of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers had the hope that the Virgin Mary's spectacle would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
The patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts during the period while observing the religious theme painting or the other.
Catholics stated that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "they calmed down and peace reigned in their hearts."
When they looked at the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so striking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, as for a mother or a father" - said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases of truth changes our personality" - Wright added.
After these formidable results there remains a single question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if Leonardo's Madonna or another painter of his stature were shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On his tenth birthday, Google can say: you can find him in people's pockets, as well as in the sky above his head; he knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit, and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this isn't enough yet.
On the other hand, skeptics who parallel the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main objective is to collect as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of Google's founders: "Let's gather into a system all the information in the world!"
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that turned the world around is still in the initial phase of the effort to deal with all the information.
To the question that what is going to happen in five years Schmidt answered like this: I would like Google to be able to answer the questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the work that would suit me best?" - however, the software will not be able to answer questions apparently so simple as long as there is not enough user information.
Not all netizens are aware that during their web browsing the search keywords, IP addresses, and pages they went to at the end of the search are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to the Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-check what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - this same logic will be based on the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who worry about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that not only do they preserve, but in justifiable cases they also cede to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify paedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who care about people's rights were relieved in May when the company, together with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated before the court that they were right in their litigation with the FBI: according to the sentence, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution, to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to achieve on the pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about 50,000 Web addresses and about a thousand phrases sought, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
Thus the opinion about Google is quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who fear to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life is harmed by starting to use Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not thus its rival, the Microsoft, listed by its Windows as conqueror of the World, no matter how much both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for its applications, the code is open and the program package free, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because geeks see with precision the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that occurred precisely because of one of the key words most mentioned in recent years: the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional traces behind us and taking advantage of the communication channels available, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music customs, then include them in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
We can learn numerous cases from which it follows that for example the bride, seeing the flow of photographs the following morning from the common friends, learns with whom she spent the previous night her fraudulent boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the management of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
The "on-line" life of a person is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that hides behind the conduct of today's youth.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least pretends to dodge Google's monopoly, can do it (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but leaves no trace).
There are many people who don't want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but Google's "on-line" applications can be replaced, from text-writing software to image and news reading applications with alternative versions that don't connect to gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile about us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten advertising agencies' revenues, while services that are increasingly introduced cause severe headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example the top management flatly rejected the protest of employees after doubling the price of the company's nursery, considered the unlimited number of employees' food too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement leaked any information that violated the good morale and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says they won't announce any new services in advance, but only when it's ready to run, what if it's certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to stir the world: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the U.S. Supreme Court, others fear its Health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, will provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man only of the data of Google can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to erase the fingerprints of the author of the double murder in the city of Ózd.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, according to substantiated suspicion, helped to erase the traces of the crime - said the spokesman for the General Commissariat of Public Order of Borsod province on Tuesday.
The young women recognized the crime they were charged with, and are currently accused of committing the crime.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - will be able to defend themselves freely.
By complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is charged with murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was prepared long before the crime was committed, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the scene of the crime.
The police analyze with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech kroner - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwig Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are held by the Polish state which in a few months wishes to sell 60 percent of the shares.
The Czech economic daily E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse were offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, stated last week that among the interested parties the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank with a 25 percent stake approximately, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - the Republic of Rome believes - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, whose aim is to give solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", which billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it is more correct to speak of a "second September 11".
According to one part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo's view, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that led the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the US monetary system is growing, and this will then affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
This threat cannot be ignored - says the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today may still throw life belts at faltering financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if more banks fall apart as I do, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
It is necessary in the long term for the member states of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received just Monday more than 100 billion euros - recalls Viennese Der Standard, adding that the concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis are becoming more real.
The EU has so far failed to deal seriously with the crisis that is going through the Old Continent.
The "saviors" will not immediately have to present hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid a greater evil?
Smart car mimics bumblebee flight
What would be the best method for developing technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the BR23C-type robot steering system imitator of nature, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our protective safety capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
The compound eyes of bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees play an important role.
To copy the function of composite eyes, engineers used the laser length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary.
Unlike any existing system at present, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If not, the robot of the vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should take place in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonals, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of turning the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as possibility for the robot of the car the rotational movement and the acceleration besides the braking.
The BR23C uses lythium-polymer batteries that are lighter and its energy density is higher, meaning that they have a longer lifetime than that of lythium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the processing capacity of the data, let alone the storage capacity.
This device in every second should only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, thus using only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No gigabyte memories are needed, no megabytes.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which according to Nissan calculations, will be able to be incorporated into the models manufactured in series within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding obstacles in his way.
This very expensive boy already has a name.
A written version of the $700 billion financial bailout package law has been prepared and will be implemented in several phases to buy bad bank loans.
Half the money will be spent in the first phase.
According to Eastern Coast schedule during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, the leaders of the congress reached an agreement around the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars in total, after several days of discussion - reported Reuters.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, stating that the agreement needs to be formalized in just one document.
The compromise made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise said: this program will work and be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving the Wall Street, but about turning the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington hours (i.e. before 2 a.m. on Monday, according to Central European times), without causing a spectacular jump in the bags.
On the bill called the 2008 Emergency Act for Economic Stabilization, the first Monday the American Congress will vote and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted Pelosi and then the White House also held news about the deal.
We are happy with the progress made during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy bad-quality credit fund securities.
Now you can only spend half of the $700 billion, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy securities credit fund securities, of bad rating and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion can be spent after a new Congressional decision.
According to the law the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and securities credit fund securities, as well as other "poisonous" type credits as well.
The purchase can be made at auctions or directly - reported competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said: the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can reach up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, be it the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some major financial institutions.
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks that are in distress and waiting for state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensations, which the American slang calls simply gold parachute.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and limitations depend on the form of assistance from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the gold parachutes, unless the failed chief of the bank retires.
By buying bad credits directly the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the chiefs' compensations are not overstated.
In addition to the above, the existing gold parachute contracts are not to be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that will be in force a legal limitation on the revenues of the directors general - commented the Democrat Barney Frank, president of the commission of Congress, responsible for the financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since ultimately they will be able to even make profits with the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
According to the bill in the next five years, the president will have to present a proposal to Congress on how to return financial sector losses to taxpayers.
Of course, reservations were expressed on both sides with regard to the draft.
This is not what the American citizens entrusted us with, that is, they are not protecting the taxpayers' dollars - declared the Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur said: the measures urged it the same ones who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The domestic sales prices of the processing industry sectors increased minimally, with 0.1 percent compared to July.
The biggest increase in price magnitude occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 per cent), due primarily to the 4.6 per cent monthly increase in bags and belts and the 2.5 per cent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical materials industry (1.6 per cent).
There was a price decrease in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machines and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 per cent).

In the rest of the processing industry sectors, prices increased by 0.2 to 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent an important weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was recorded in August, first as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from the first of July.
In a comparison of a period of twelve months - in the domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of decisive weight, there was an increase of 11 per cent.
There was a decline in prices in the textile industry (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the rest of the processing sectors the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.

Will you no longer need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to enter into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before the Hungarians living there.
In his opinion "practically everything depends on the timely construction on the other side of the Atlantic of the electronic access and control system".
At the same time he warned that in the new system the admission permit will disappear, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin will have to register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will interview Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing her the Median Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the banks' financial bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties secured Sunday their support for the administration's $700 million banking aid program, while there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Finance Minister.
The representatives of Congress and the administration, after negotiations of several marathon-like days, in the early morning of Sunday, announced: a principled agreement was reached on the banks' financial bailout package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market, became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more able than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, by bringing economic issues to the forefront, Obama regained some advantage and the McCain advantage he had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy for the vice presidency disappeared.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the proposal included those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and responsibly (...) employment, your savings and entire industries and the stability of the whole economy are in danger" - he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to qualify McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview given to ABC McCain he explained that "we will all barely swallow this (...) but not doing anything simply is not a viable path".
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission to the minister of fineries and the limitation of executive compensations, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no important role in the consultations, instead he consulted the minister daily.
Congressional President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen will probably vote on the bill by Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious electors - says the Der Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a reddish coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he analyses the motives for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken office.
The Christian socialites for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now just these modern citizens are the ones who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that had already been foreseen for almost ten years: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. even during the much-mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents .
Sociologists have already predicted this 40 years ago, but in the rhythm they were wrong. However, secularization, the results of the education and the settlement of the Germans of the North in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the electors of the CSU.
Modernisation also increases possibilities, and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious, most critical and most stubborn electors.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it was precisely the conventional groups of the citizens who left the CSU the most, the self-employed, the small industrialists, the high school students and the graduates.
Thus, CSU support was turned to less than 40 per cent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
Vienna's conservative newspaper: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - it deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, while the Greens still do not want to consult on the coalition.
The elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely let any of their decks be seen.
Werner Faymann, the SPÖ president, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left open the question that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the post of vice chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said cooperation will surely not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party if they will choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
The president of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host being France, which this year is also the current president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, deputy of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Gypsy children and is also the greatest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press bureau of Fidesz's group of MEPs in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Gypsies are left out of the labour market in the first place because of their low level of schooling.
"Most young Gypsies have not completed secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can obtain a university diploma."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, there is a need to raise awareness of these issues among both Roma and non-Gypsies.
For the earlier a Gypsy student starts school, the more likely he will be to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumer taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and guarantee the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - highlighted Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary in order to speed up school desegregation processes immediately, for this the correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens" - Járóka demanded.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be made on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the top of the Bavarian CSU, debate on personal issues has been postponed for the time being.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party to be held the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-criticized duo left a glimpse: they don't hold on to their positions so much.
With this they intended to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organization, who the day after the Bavarian "tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria which gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the province of the South, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will certainly have to form a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, Vice President Horst Seehofer, federal minister of agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that begins negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Free Right Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used for the coup of the Huber-Beckstein duo, enters parliament on the list of Free Electors, and then cruelly erased ambitious local politics from the stage.
The top leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition he will receive an active role also Stoiber who until now was moving the strings in the background, the former head of provincial government and former president of the CSU rated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag election, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to enhance the CSU together which played a major role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could barely hide his disappointment at the failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
This is, of course, relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent reached its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's Opposition: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that it guarantees in the country Alexandr Lukashenko, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
While the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, consisting of a hundred and ten deputies, has no opposition more than a decade ago, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate following the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time "would allow" the entry of some opposition deputies into parliament.
Thus the SDGsZ suppressed the boycott that it originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which increasingly depends economically on Russia - which took credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline passing through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give Lukashenko and other high-level politicians entry permission for having a political regime considered undemocratic.
It was a sign of détente when the OSCE, in evaluating the election campaign, placed emphasis rather on positive phenomena and not on errors - such as the ban on participation imposed on one third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary Monday report even criticized the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has already considered the two regions as independent a month ago.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - Alexandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime fears to allow even an opponent to enter that weightless parliament."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations as it sees the results, but rather tries to send the voters their message about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before its distribution, but even so I see that more and more people support the change among adults as well - said Milinkevich, referring to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, do not consider it adequate even for pensioners, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security decomposition is "like the silence of cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
Russian observers, contrary to the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in deeds", so that the lack of opposition is nothing other than the testimony of the maturity of the Belarusian electors.
Brunetta: "From now on you eat breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Palacio Chigi that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
But from today it starts with this measure against whom you file and then you go to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This new development was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta and the Secretary General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" the minister said.
"A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is Reformism," Brunetta stresses again.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, says the secretary general: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on the part of them."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and crockery.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister declares that "in three months the absences due to diseases of public employees have been reduced of 50%, meaning 60,000 more people to work in a year".
He adds that public administration needs to be rendered more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the rate of inflation".
For now millions of public employees have joined forces to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the Codacons-supported petition.
"While the minister of the civil service shows the numbers, the least absenteeism of work due to illness – writes the association of consumers – the people of the 'lazy workers' are constantly increasing.
There are millions indeed in Italy the correct and productive employees of the public administration who have joined in declaring war to the illegitimate norms of the decree".
In particular, the Tar will answer the exclusion of economic treatments added due to illness due to service; the extension of the time belts in which the medical visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Current prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures testifying to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says President Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his “great appreciation for the constant associative efforts in favour of prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and public awareness”.
"It has manifested itself, a 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality proposes to us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the many initiatives promoted in the field of schools for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep alive the attention to the phenomenon, not to stop the alarm about the social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, House Speaker Gianfranco Fini stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to put an end urgently".
"Data on accidents at work seem to point to a slight positive development, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," said President of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "trend to decline" to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy exploits.
"We believe that at a general level it is still too little done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of the workers, and this from the world of the school ".
"It serves a ulterior effort - it has added - in terms of the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion.
But above all, there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship foreseen for the victims of work" and the "care derived towards which the system is heading in recent years".
"The objective is to restore to the worker the guarantee of the insurance - it has added - because the fate of the one who is injured does not have to depend on the gift arranged by the legislator each time".
Mp3 Readers Under Accusation, Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to high volume music for a long time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injury.
This is what the European Commission refers to, which in a statement published in Bruxel cites the opinion of the newly identified Scientific Commission on Emerging and Health Risk (Csrseri) of the Ue, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the apparatus at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity".
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and cell phones at a high acoustic level may unconsciously ruin their ears irremediably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific evidence – Ue responsibility follows – a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize the consumers and render this information in the public domain.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are broadly effective and take the step with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this causes.
"Scientists - concludes executive Ue - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and the interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related devices".
At present, there is already a European safety standard which limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concerns increase as the auditory damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit such damage greatly by using solutions such as reduced levels and noise exposure time.
According to him, the Scientific Committee Ue realizes that the users of portable musical devices listen at high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceeds the limit currently in force regarding maximum noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, Alemanno gives the way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today begins, March closes, June will be the accounts.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been installed this morning in its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the strategic Piano for Rome with the "official bagel" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to emphasize Alemanno – It must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then be endorsed.
There is no leftover position of roles, only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time ending.
In June – announced the mayor – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome".
To whom the Commission accuses of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be essential.
Almost always the politics is crushed in the ordinary management and in emergencies that return again manifest themselves..
We, on the contrary, want to look further and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously towards the development of Rome and its future."
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, not coastal a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that squeeze the capital".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or motionless, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking with unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome "will not be limited only to the present communal confines but will look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that he is interested in being independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and had relations (as he also does today gives private citizen) with enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
a Miami lady wrote on a Web site: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he will win the nation's highest office that has had two governors and five black senators!"
They're really attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And there's the polls; they all say Obama won and with a good lead.
Also in this case there is one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in the Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote we will know well who will be voted by the American patriot.
One side of the American mentality comes out with cover to the last.
"Say what you want, we'll think later where to put the cross, whether about Obama or about McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
things never said before now, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the democratic is George Bush.
They have asked 1500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the ass.
In Iraq, there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Likewise, Iraq for most has been Bush's weak spot.
Whoever will take George W's place will have a huge duty to carry out.
Use, the economic collapse is felt also for journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "murder" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
While today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
Do not feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed.
In addition to the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, it is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is not to be reduced substantially as the majority of the public understands it.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following the wrong path.
At the local level, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views as the "murderer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in hope "to do something good" for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
Fifty-six per cent of national executives are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage falls to 23 per cent.
For some, this has to do with "work security."
The executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a question of "take it or leave it."
Directors almost always receive good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social insurance.
For the holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, become "sick" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAPERATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the contra pact concerning the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process in his charge, last week, he obtained home release, transforming it into compulsory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate could travel the route of the city of the province to a room of the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has given the opposite vote) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the representatives' camera vote against the $700 million salvation plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times of yesterday confirms to us that the current crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions and to the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the states of the Central and the South.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the vow of who spoke at first.
This scarcely cited is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Whether in the United States or in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to act as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double state-sovereignty category in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance those that have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or they don't have much to say: the crucial test is The European Union which divides as always between different interests and different state strategies is unable to decide any common policy.
It is from the government of every state that everyone is expected an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the moment you reach the court it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of resources financed to remedy things.
And they also have the means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, securities in certain circumstances in which no market will likely and no organization will ever be able to dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the web of ever more sophisticated technology, of immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do more and more accounts with unimmaterial things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, notice, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever is sovereign, certainly has many more letters to him who is not, and to him who has the misfortune of living in a position without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but foreshadows a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of economic species relieved inadequate with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in a growing number.
It seems to advance ever more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far booming, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the sympathetic exception of the end, to have done their own time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "return" or in the sudden changes of collective humors of recent times, from the conservative departure in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American congress against Bush (and layers also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with it).
It has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say some, always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what since today that is taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially stirs in excess.
In the face of all this talking of a "mass rebellion" is now frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walking on walls like spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have a 100 - kilo body glued to a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from Dayton University, Akron University, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered in microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful from the legs of this reptile and at the same time "it easily takes off from the walls", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton's Engineering Faculty.
"This material could be useful as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk the walls exactly like spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think to a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
ANOTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley in California is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers such as hairs that self-clean from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich of vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packaged that fresh associated with the assumption of some medicinals David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since 236esimo meeting national of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: enough a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of the patients.
Grapefruit juice was already low because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some antiarrhythmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological.
GERMANY TO RISKS – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in an information bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mixture and to pay attention to what is being drunk in the case a drug is being assumed such as that to Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO – According to experts also orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of the active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milano:"These discoveries in general are pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicinals that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, not let us be impressed, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly", stressed the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Novel of Economy to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches Princeton University and is a noted New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's decisions regarding the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attack, in those days when Enron broke, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in ending accordingly for the United States.
A forecast that sparked much controversy and that for several years came reproached to the economy, but which has now proved accurate.
"I am surprised and a little annoyed by how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value", but also a divulgator with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office echoes third edition of anti-Microsoft package
It is the day of the launch of the OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract ever more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, of which their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several innovations: to the welcome screen and to the less rude magazine interface, more consistent ones are added, such as the compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also put to multi operation with the Office Suite 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the dimension of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via electronic post, or the possibility to import the PDF file in the graphic production module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graph of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text maker.
The Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, over the clouds), and in the coming weeks should give the ultimate result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to that for Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for Linux operating system.
On request the installation cd can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of the free can be a hook for dissemination in the houses, it is in business that Open Office tries the suite, tries the big bet, already being able to have several projects realized in the public administration and in the schools.
And even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened, are not lacking.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eat in the case of the known Access is the program that consents to work on the base data; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the figure previewed can be exceeded.
Also Kohl turns out positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the tour of France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the team Gerolsteiner, third ranked and winner of the best shirt of the climber.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26 years old is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also they of the Gerolsteiner.
Tests of Kohl's blood champions enter among those performed in recent weeks in Losanna's laboratory and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the contras confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place to the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive doping to the third generation Epo is the head of the French antidoping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has declared to the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the back of Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, awarding himself the shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES WONDER, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy as an emigrant country has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? Is this what the New York Times asks itself in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso murdered the previous month in Milan for having stolen a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment of the country and the highest support of the North league".
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation desired by the Lega tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendency marked by the Pope that by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedetto XVI in Congress has asked the State and the church to work together to combat racism".
Student victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros per room
The rent market for university students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the tenant union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to sustain - explains the head of the office studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has totally distorted the market to the point of triggering a process of generalized increase even for the residents".
Apart from the fact that in most cases the rent offers contain a series of violations: free type contracts, not registered, no fee limit, linked sub-rents.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the revision of tax taxation, prices can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, one room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 euros for a single room.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other universities (Ostian and Cinecittà).
Economics is made only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you will be served 300/450 euros, for a room you will spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed you can get 250/350 euros, at least 350 euros for a single bed.
In the smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute finishes, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and non-EU students is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel historic halls
The historical cinemas close favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without movie theaters in a blind city, it's like a face without eyes".
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalizing cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticones on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono halls in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory," it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion were shared", observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury to Cannes, which told the poetry of a cinema of province and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that perhaps lost forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of traders, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay most are above all the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas less, following Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the one responsible for its disappearance is the agreement of the multiplex, are proper these three Italian regions that have made record the greater number of new meticones cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 be in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," says Paolo Protti, president of the Anec," it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to transfer to the meticones.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favour of traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector it would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year."
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to worry about closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the mono-sala cinema in the historical center that on the periphery.
Among the rules provided for are measures of fiscal facilitation in favour of managers and benefits for the public at the end of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic area and will have special parking fees.
"It's an initiative I like" says Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope other cities follow Bologna's example by setting up other measures.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of meticones, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important to me: the closing of the Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Paradiso cinema", which I had already thought about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass ahead of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the signs blackened by dust, I turn to the other side».
Link between politics and 'drangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"Gioia Tauro mayor was available to standardize municipality election for stakeholders to cosca Piromalli".
It is heavy to accuse the magistrates of the anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria of giving the mayor and vice-intendent of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association.
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, namesake of the Boss, already convicted of criminal mafia association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Despising any legal and moral norms, and of good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
"The Mafia family would have been allowed – judges write – to officially enter the municipality's internal affairs by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the regional board of Calabrés Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life there are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'drangheta, heroes who stay clean."
Those arrested this morning are added to those from last July after the police had announced the cutting of heads of the Piromalli Mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the city council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, as early as 1991 and always due to alleged conditionings between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from the commission to administer the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the balloting in May 2006, had been elected as head of a centre-right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call on the Deputy Minister of the Interior who was Marco Minniti at the time, accusing him of having organized everything for a political question, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for variation of the A3 road project.
From the ambient interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerge "the readiness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families".
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage
It is an exterminated site that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources upon which the great ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s along with the first oil crisis, investigations intensified.
When the price of low oil, in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was set aside, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated by 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This amount would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies those who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – has declared the spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal – and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a fairly important sign, considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy there is no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts like those Portuguese or Scots are small in size and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a long scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas attached to each other.
The force of the waves, which causes the boas to move up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure spins a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four such implants under development, pending only federal approval, apart from energy, could serve a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides, spins the turbine pallets, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that it has a long cast of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the development of electric energy, merits at this time the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coasts, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
