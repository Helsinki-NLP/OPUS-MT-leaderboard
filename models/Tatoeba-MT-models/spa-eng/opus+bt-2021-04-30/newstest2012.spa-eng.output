Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Penal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former Prime Minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia disadvantageous for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet final, the appellate court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code, which condemned the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
Approval required 226 votes.
Libya's Victory
The history of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without it there is no war anymore.
It remains to be defined who is the winner
As is already customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of elucidating whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has brought into force the traditional law, Sharia, which we already know in some ways.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, made up of warring tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya, an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and, probably, it was not in the interests of the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters accepted gratefully the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When seeking victors in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shooting that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crossers"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies get the Libyan black gold just in good words?
It is quite possible that no, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of the sharia don't come across us.
A New Era of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe go hunting for the investor seeker
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarterly period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors no longer only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
Both countries have made public the data for the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1 %), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1 % (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew year-on-year by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the inter-quarterly period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to ČSU the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic development growth is conformed.
The results are even worse than analysts' forecasts.
Main events:
Annually, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated four-monthly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest on their ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on ten-year Czech bonds remains at 4%, although in the area the situation is worsening.
In Germany, voices are raised saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
Czechs are classified for the Euro Cup.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a 200 million premium.
The football team fulfills the hardest task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended itself fantastically against the attacks of the local team, so that it will not miss the European championship appointment.
IHNED.cz followed the party's development in detail in a thorough report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, as well as the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates their pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured parties were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who missed two major occasions.
Also, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the eleven Czech will not miss the appointment of the European Cup, so the coffers of national football will get a gratification of approximately 200 million crowns.
Already from the first few minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams just tried to keep the lines and played just around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, patadones to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture, they wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students began praying Tuesday at noon at the facility and then chanted death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students trained on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan human shields around the nuclear technology center where uranium is worked.
They intend to demonstrate their willingness to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is striving to achieve nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon before the nuclear facilities in Isfahan and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyse the Iranian nuclear programme, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan plant but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would be reached.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity at 5 per cent.
Obese children come mostly from families with a lifestyle that is unhealthy, according to current research.
It again demonstrates the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obese children feed, for example, on sausages at least twice as often as children from normal weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten fries the day before the test, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence".
In families of overweight children there is no practice of sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children replied that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and nearly 900 basic education children from all over the Czech Republic participated in the survey.
It was already the second edition of the "Obesity is not a coincidence" program, which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th grade.
A proper diet and plenty of exercise in the family are determining factors, which make the number of overweight and even obese children significantly decrease.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals a day according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," picks up one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with lunch for dinner
Specialists warn that, in healthy development, the details, which also count, such as having a fixed hour for family breakfast, are also important.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of school children ' s families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households nothing is eaten.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children the unhealthy chips are consumed much more frequently.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink sweet sodas daily (70%).
As a rule, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed sport, but among their parents this result is reduced by less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make up your diet
The next phase of the study made it possible for the chosen children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets based on all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal."
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"The popularity of soft drinks is particularly alarming," the study's final report warns.
As a main meal, the pasta is taken from the palm and followed closely by the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Switching to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the monitoring group of the participants in the study, who completed the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", in many cases there was an important change in favor of the principles of a healthy diet", is indicated in the results of the study.
Attention is drawn, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal, running water.
Children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for the main meal and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals maintain
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, how to dress up problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in show business.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, a pin no longer fits.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone's short neck, someone's got a stylized figure without the right curves and someone's overweight.
The stylist must be able to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of Jennifer Lopez's type women, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not to dress it in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants don't fit, it's worth sewing at least one piece of extra tailor-made fabric.
They will certainly not regret it, for the clothes they feel perfectly are unpayable.
With a custom skirt you will feel much better than with one that doesn't stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, trimmings, embroidery or draping.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have all week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assignment, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who will have to design two changing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
The current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question, must be taken into account.
It's been my turn to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Screaming inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained some 100 kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gómez.
The dresses have to be cut from the magazines or searched on the internet and printed, and then worked out graphically.
The moodboard, which is what the full result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, does not dress only physically, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (for specific topics such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us all about this.
But all this is due on Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information on all types of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a coat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in classics with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body in heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or you just roll it up and up your neck to get a totally different picture.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to first know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
It is finally clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this has to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style represent only half the success in many cases.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, for the time being, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters find it useless too (I have enough skills, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, it should be borne in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate a size very different from their real (minor) size.
Then it is only left to gobble up and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, whether a certain celebrity has gained weight/thinness, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to focus on fashion, but has to understand outfit.
During his work, he must communicate with the people he saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
You know how to value people, you don't miss them, you defend their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and complete it with pretty clothes, you can't take and throw away everything there was and say, "I'm so scared."
"Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend so someone can put them on," Mario says.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
It is fixed around the waist and has all the necessary tools there.
They are objects like scissors, such as scissors, skin removers, or impermissible. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as handbags or hats), special clips of clothing front, if it is larger (pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing set.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to clothe the soles of the shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and even more the exterior could be damaged.
And we did nothing but clothe and clothe.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in lauding my work unreservedly.
Actually, I'm not very good at those skills.
This is just a small part of everything we've heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that professional styling isn't a pink road, but I don't care exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes throughout America.
Overview
A journey, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of improper oversights of a routine journey during tomorrow's shift.
To some extent, expectations were met, but this is of no use, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new installment, to which The Run is added, raised high expectations already before its premiere.
He promised that he would give new airs to the old race series Need for Speed and, as a result of what was shown, appears as a game that should not end up being a genre of action again.
We also feel curious to know how the inserted scenes would look, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As usually happens in NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total computation points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In reality, we cannot and cannot call ourselves mistakes, but rather the incomprehensible disillusionment of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit at the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
That way, you don't even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries in the series.
So, it's nothing from the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that diminishes visibility.
In the mountains, however, care must be taken not to be buried by an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to get ahead of a required number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then you try to buy time (timed classic tooth) and then a duel awaits you against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this sometimes the police appear, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than would be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race conceived with enough action is well suited to this style of driving, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, so good.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correctness of driving models, collisions are no longer the same.
Of games of this type you cannot be expected to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by doing a very tight run or running the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or it even ends up completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can make you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or get off the track, the game restores you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five available resets are available in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the start.
So it's just a help in case something doesn't go well, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, even resetting does not help, it only helps to learn the given stage from memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or you arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or stop.
It's the same when you arrive, because it's programmed because the "surprise" will always happen right under your nose.
The adversaries also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
This also happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come in front of you, so at first you can mush the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it surely disappoints you right away.
And it's a shame, because even if the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action, so it is often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or qualifying in the race so that boredom doesn't fit, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during racing.
You have to be attentive to the petrol pumps next to the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough of what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight motorways and exotic supersports for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the upper level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with background for the profile.
At the same time, there is an online Autolog feature, which compares your results with those of other players and makes other community functions available.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the tunnel of the metro (pass), where you start to run in darkness along the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and suddenly from behind comes the convoy of the metro and takes you just ahead.
In the editorial we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the game programming no one even thought a little or whether the authors actually take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
What a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, at times, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore rather confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble asserting that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It feels like the game isn't over.
The fun is assured, but get ready because the mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of some airport reflectors.
The Carolina University choirs will participate in the concert "Students of Velvet".
The joint celebration of International Students' Day and the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution as a musical experience will take place for the third time at the Festa Academica festival.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
Czechs have a reputation as negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect an unstoppable war to take place."
"It will last five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," thus began her lecture at the Faculty of Law, the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, with conviction.
How not to take seriously his slogan "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said already at the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers of the U. Carolina School of Law.
Vicenová also pondered the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing comes criticism, that if it is rude, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I have to say that it left everyone baffled, because it assumes its roles to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position of representative of Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union vis-à-vis states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban Olomouc's cheese from us.
Vicenová has also taken care of the agenda followed, follows and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU so far has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good fuss", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive the most support and which less? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, strangers or slang that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not actually invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes or that no one will ban us from Olomouc cheese?".
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, Czechs are known as Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
It also regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
Blame is on a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says to me, "What, you are here, those of the Visegrad Group?", and it is not funny at all."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, is awaiting very tough new budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, rather than the new 'European Federation'.
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure".
"It was said for the first time that only those countries that want to cooperate and those that don't, stay out."
"These procedures will increasingly strengthen the two-speed Europe", Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among member states, not just among Eurozone members.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were looking for a term that defined IBM's strategy very precisely, the most approximate would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet a hundred years have passed since its founding.
The basis of this long-term character was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his label, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised company culture.
"For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous movement in the direction of the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fearing the changes around.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century," said the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano during his anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the businessman from Baa in the Czech Republic ( IBM's employees were among the first American workers to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in its relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company was able to discover talents (as one of the first companies in the world to eliminate any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM's current plan, whereby Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
In recent years IBM has participated in so-called virtual encounters, brainstorming online, from which countless future strategies and innovations emerge.
Not surprisingly, almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technology company," says Harvard Business School professor economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the US familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It hosts the largest number of patents from all US technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
His inventions include ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
IBM will bill $220 billion this year. This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first outnumbered Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
That's why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and likewise, if they don't work, it abandons them).
And that's the difference of competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which about a fifth are from programs and another fifth from teams.
However, even in 1990 teams accounted for more than half of the supplier's share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets for a total value of $15 billion. Over the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first emerged.
IBM acts on the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far IBM has been able to weather the crisis.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.
IBM's currency is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from cheese cutter to spaceflight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 - it was originally a brand used at branches in Canada and South America.
The basis that gave rise to IBM's birth arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He owned inventions such as the famous "ticket clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired his supervisory council.
Flint signed the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The new leader overshadowed the founder of IBM ( Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson ran the company, turnover doubled by $9 million and began the company's large expansion across continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly forty years in the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fishes", which established the computer standard of that time, arrived on the market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering comprehensive advice and services of high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet."
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not been improved, for example with regard to transport and city administration.
For the trading sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch office in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her cheating husband:
Iveta, stay on that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtáová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but no longer as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové to her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the petition, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Șíčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
She even publicly stated that she loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepting her husband's relationship and even saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out."
"But here I would live not as my dear old drunkard who made a mistake, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová said, adding that she had already unhooked herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't mind his wife shutting the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I spoke normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not oppose it.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, or where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and took full responsibility," concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that manage to make the blood boil to the males?
Shopping
Do you blame your half orange for its dependence on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one rag a week?
Do you like to shop often at sales?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to just walk around the clothing stores, look for tight clothes and then try them all on the dressing room (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can practically become hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner to wait for you in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't these phrases ring a bell?
Isn't that right?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite merry-go-round.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, remove the dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on your clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for soiling a clean washbasin and a shelf with glass doors that you had so much trouble cleaning?
In case you suffer this "deviation", prove to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should surely not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"Weared briefs are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those socks tomorrow too."
"Wet cloth is not left on the ground!"
If you make those cometaries to your partner more times a day, know that it will get you out of your hair.
You don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Calumnias and gossips
Some women also find slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
Maybe every single one of us sometimes misses a little harmless gossip.
With your hand in your heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossiping women who don't control themselves, who love gossiping and often do, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a women's work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat the Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jágr participated on Monday in the NHL encounter with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and put Czech players back in the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and took one more step and was declared best player of the match.
He was awarded two assists in the match and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Before the game I had told him I'd triplet."
"I sensed it."
"Sometimes they look like ambushes," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first stroke.
A while later the team's second intervention also had a Czech trail.
Voráček took the record from behind the goal of the Hurricanes and moved it between the circles until Maxim Talbot, who scored goal.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through Wayne Simmonds' goal room.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player on the field, but he's definitely among the top three," Jágr asked his headquarters.
"It would never have occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him."
"I'm very satisfied with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my colleagues played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the match into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then Dwyer's again, penalty, until he got a goal away.
Matt Read allowed no further complications, although they ended up outnumbered two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field".
"He cleared the record, I took speed and Read went to the furthest part."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the last goal of the match as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the East Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an injury to the upper body.
The Canadiens lost not only one player with a lot of defense experience, but also a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec did not know how to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the lost points to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and played the match only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels."
"Finally, but against that you can't do anything, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to further simplify the game, get the record out of our field."
"And so we leave gaps," explained one of the defenses, P.K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
Jets goals were scored by five players who thus ended a series of losses that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia at the time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time sold in most cases trips only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and the trips of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even in socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies were also offering trips to the West at the time, but one had to stand in line with a sleeping bag and spend the night like this, or have "good acquaintances" at the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West was not granted to the "politically unreliable people," who could not travel at all.
Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The Czechs' way of travelling has suffered a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us he was the only one going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that Croatia's current favourite destination, until 1989 could not be travelled freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s, visa waivers were imposed for travel to neighbouring Western European States, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see enough of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in the parks in tents, since our income at the time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was to take with them the food (conservatives, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and so did average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in the demand for travel.
With increased demand for travel agencies began, starting in 1997, regularly, to prepare for travel using charter flight connections, which led to an incredible drop in travel prices compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 90s of the last century, Czechs were already travelling without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the US, which further simplified our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened as early as 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries depart every year. This winter will already fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15 thousand CZK per head on overseas trips, including expenses on the stay site.
Convened Ordinary General Assembly to elect the president, who could end up again in deadlock.
For almost five months Czech football has been without president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, agreement has not yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you cannot even vote to choose from among the three candidates.
Interested in leading Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from office in June not without first summoning his colleagues to find a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the end of the Hašek era, a controversy broke out between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This became clear on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dääm), located in the Prague neighbourhood of Smichov, because the talks had been blocked and not just in terms of the method of election.
No consensus was reached on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that point on, and because of this one point, there was a partial agreement, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed by the Executive Committee which, at its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically resolved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how do we proceed in the third round to avoid deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who, from the management of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have the majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," as Svoboda understands the Moravian side's objections, according to which it would be best not to touch order and vote according to applicable statutes.
With that said, surprisingly, Tomaš Paclík also agrees, although the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to be more convenient to Pelta.
"I would like to see a vote as far as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense is invented about representatives as in the last General Assembly," says Victoria Plzen's owner, who first ran for office and directed his remarks primarily against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be appeased with today's match of our national team at the European Championships.
"Football will again be the protagonist, and this will make it easier to cooperate," says Jablonice's representative, who of the three candidates has more experience in managing football, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope that agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"I hope common sense will prevail anyway," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the game begins whether the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others the vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which they say will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the country's most powerful sports organization for an agreement to be reached.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak sports federation (ČSTV) which will try to give a new direction to Czech sport following the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of Pilsen's footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not stand as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there were a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and not run for election."
"But to this day such a person has not been found," Paclík said for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the election, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he were to win, he would remain in the position of president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position you would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too closely related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I could take into account."
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that right now they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What supposedly annoys Paclík most at the moment is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the current status would remain and nothing in football will change".
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a wiretapping during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us," said Paclík, who also takes some caution in his earlier statement that "he would sell Club Pilsen if Pelta became president."
In the event of winning Thursday's elections, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Of the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation."
"but not as an association manager."
"I also don't put my nose in there where I don't feel able," added Paclík, who in September attracted a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Referee Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the partnership.
He uses his management skills of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of the Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the victory in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some lobbyists, who probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations," Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta President Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it put pressure on political leaders to devote more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new president should devote himself."
"If they raise taxes on gambling, as the political parties announce, it would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to go," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with Club Pilsner, although he himself claims that the FAČR President should be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in hypocritically ceding my Pilsen Club shares to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the deadlock in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, should he be elected, he would ensure that FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve future disputes over electoral regulations.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Even before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could do him well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People at all levels have been working on football for a long time now and hope to meet the new President this Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who primarily associates himself with the Jablonice Club, but who worked on the Sparta and the Association's executive committee.
For this reason, he thinks he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly the statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have had a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win over delegates.
"If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and am willing to respond in case this fails."
"It's a matter of principles, without which we can't exist," Pelta says.
Besides, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he saw himself collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had not been long since attacked Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with a head.
"He's been in the football world for over a year, and he's already achieved some successes."
"His attacks but they were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains true to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the top.
The latter should be a football promotion showcase.
"At the same time, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately get involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal changes to the staff.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the next general assembly, he believes delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader," even two days before the most decisive day in its representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would begin to work eagerly.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, in case of election, hard work would be done.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each football area individually.
He is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself entirely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
"By this I do not mean that I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the executive committee's competencies so that each member can devote himself or herself to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that he has considered not to run again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me and hinder me at every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because then the others would give up as well."
"It's about having faith not to give up like this, just like that," he said.
They say he is also motivated to continue the work he has already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, a great deal of work was finished that I don't want to lose now."
"There are processes that had begun and will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them," he announced concerned that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before Hašek's time.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is mostly all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few chosen."
"I can be reproached for a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because that's the only way everyone will feel good and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to assert otherwise, I have in mind to do my utmost for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech and one Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would not be the current situation in which we have only three Moravian teams, which represents a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of Club Pilsner, joined the presidential elections, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
"I am still sorry to have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include saving some tens of millions of crowns from disadvantaged contracts, television contract negotiations and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "unqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"In the event he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can experience their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something he couldn't miss in his luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying on her back on the water, she looked at the artistic dome on top, swimming towards the marble angels, waiting for her at the edge of the pool and marveling at the carefully restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
He doesn't want anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers him that bath fans have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while jogging enthusiasts can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the joyous trills of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The splash in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are attended, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, the indoor pools can be a real gift to the view: "Instead of soil, in the bathrooms you have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically folded: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages with very interesting information about the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, there are the waters with nitrates in a unique karstic cavity (bathrooms in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose swimming pools are alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many discovered pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city sets eyes on Zurich's roofed pool, you can look at Arlberb, snow covered, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bath in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: The water cathedral of Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources steam rises in winter, while from the background the mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, didn't get the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gas oil plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legame sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in his search for beautiful bathing places, when he wanted to visit uncovered pools and sunbathing in Luhatschowitz's Czech bath, he encountered a blocked ground.
The 1902 bath of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weed grow between the tiles.
Decline countered in a lovely swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can you discover neo-Roman elements of the times of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall of Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural from the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," says Meder.
In a palace like this the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural commodity business?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to one study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges raise prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer advocate's campaign specifically targets Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were thought to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have disengaged from offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank’s management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann's trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Stakes at rising food prices show in a particularly drastic way how ruthless banks currently harm public welfare."
Ackermann is found to be the largest banking lobbyist, especially in obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts the money at stake for food price betting," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the subject of starving people or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
The inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation it can perfect its image.
And he needs you to just care about potential losses, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices would be held.
Many customers of the bank showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
43 percent would discourage such a bank from its acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The transferred pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the universal Austrian exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and fell apart.
Now it reopens as an exhibition house.
Modern post-gerra architecture is passionate, clear shapes, glass halls, brave curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered until now a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the southern station of Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and inside a 20th century museum was opened, it was called the "house 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and decays more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, an ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore, and an office building should also be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he significantly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The window profile of the glass façade was changed, a fiberglass reinforced insulating glass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly the way it used to be.
And all this with strict control by the memorial office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the memorial protection office," Krischanitz says and warns of rough soil in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and alterations, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
An architecture like this is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "awaken the right consciousness".
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, a stroke of urban luck has happened. The totally new and planned "central station neighborhood", with housing and offices, is next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck will happen: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you hear, negotiates with the city on a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package amounting to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of personnel must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the breakdowns and delays of trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking a plan of internal crisis of the group, of the investments previewed until 2005 of a total of approximately 300 million euros.
For what needs to be achieved better availability of vehicles and rail network even with extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train breakdowns and delays also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been awaiting authorization from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the break of an axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millionaire fines in the US.
After the tumult over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the industry giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (€106 million) in an agreement, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA reprimands many large banks to induce credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks deep into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank admits no guilt with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a $20.5 million payment.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect customer investments.
The NCUA is trying to recover the losses of millions caused.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also requested accounts from other large banks and in summer brought lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the US housing bubble broke out in 2007, it led to the doom of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a difficult wind is currently blowing for American banks.
Investors and inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or punish misdemeanours.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of lawsuits.
It reproaches the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a demand for FHFA, which is businesses worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to answer for "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests heavily in the IBM Information Technology company.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology as the forecasts of the long-term development of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM's business report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM offers above all services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, a Warren Buffett investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the information technology primitive should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett currently unveiled at the CNBC economics station that has acquired shares of IBM worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has thus promoted one of IBM's largest shareholders with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the engagement so far.
He commended the leadership that dealt with the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative Information Technology services such as the operation of calculation centers.
The old computer pioneer of more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 subsidiaries of its own, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That's why he's an idol to countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense to earn money has given him the nickname "Omaha's oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM stock on the stock market rose by one percent.
"The Blue Giant," as IBM is known, has a stock market value of over $220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he does not want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat comes true
After the discovery of "Zwickau's cell", the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that rekindles.
The murders of eight small business tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a far right background.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost who was thought to have been killed a long time ago has returned, since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing background against Turks had occurred.
However, there has never been any question of xenophobia in Germany.
The ultra-right network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were far from foreseeable.
"Is Bloody Ideology Reviving?" headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" notes on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant for the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-right pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil at Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with the German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn event on the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
Coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media outlets as a slap: "The German gift for the 50th anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
"It starts to smell bad," says the column title of Ahmet Külahci.
He highlights that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the internet forums of Turkish-born Germans, the behaviour of the police and their subsequent success in searches are very critically discussed.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not long sought suspects in the circle of the ultra-right.
Some are less rhetorical about the drastic means: "From now on you lose, immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany's internal peace strongly depends on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the whole network.", writes "Selen".
This means that, if Germany's internal peace is in danger, the attacks on Mölln and Solingen will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memoirs.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks who live here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the weakness of German politics following the attacks was criticized mainly, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the attack in the form of a fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the German Turks contribute with taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media shows once again how profound the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country has been since then.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time frank words are needed.
The Lake Zurich Scandal Bank
The most risky bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it's run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it became known that in 2013 he would start in a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the administrative board of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops friendly observations on his future companions.
"USB has achieved revitalization".
"I'm glad to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all of the bank's security systems and let down 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, general manager of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the USB administrative board has since been considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the administrative council in May, not early 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and advisor and has had a period of adaptation surely necessary.
He suddenly takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just re-proved that it deserves the title "the biggest bank of Europe's scandal" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it slips from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also handy, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's big banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later banker in Zurich for many years, explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified USB as a model for a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was regarded as a great and very smart banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To carry this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course that some looked scornfully until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the administrative council, in 2006 on Switzerland's second highest paid administrative council, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from the UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS confessed more or less to helping with tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for wealthy customers: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the administrative board.
And the exodus of clients' funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculation and in the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud.
And just when it was quieter again, just when it was thought that the UBS would get it again, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator let down 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still doesn't work well with risk management in investment banking.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with the UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So the idea of caution emerged, with which Swiss bankers had long stood, to be the guardians of the greatest goods in the world: no risk too great, but the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprungli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich does not fit the cliche of the solid Swiss private bank, it is only a little older.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich's Bahnhofstraße Street, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewellers like Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses such as Sprungli confectionery.
Swiss banks have resided here for years: from the national bank, to the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered in marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bench there is a large sign to indicate "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
The UBS has become too large, he says, mainly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, handed over its first big profit and then the disaster came, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the jungle of high risk as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
What do you think?
They talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank arises that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served for the two different precursor banks of the UBS to complement each other: a rich but sleeping bank with the center of property management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a large financial bike.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the administrative council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive one who managed to make his way from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: The folly came before the case.
The employees of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of directors, at which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: To lower the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps worked out for him.
In foreign exchange transactions and in stock trading he was at the top.
However, the advisors of responsible companies highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the "fixed income" banking language, there is huge compensation for large banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost him his existence.
Greeding for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to own American mortgages and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, he sought the descent for a long time.
"In summer 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
The positions in the UBS became projectible seats and are insecure to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea, to end investment banking, to concentrate on property management, to return to Swiss real estate.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking needs to go down a lot, it's clear today.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitory solution, as the bank broke surprisingly away from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed himself: He must permanently run the UBS business, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
It abolishes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money on?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask at present.
So far he's just saying he'll first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The impending recession in Europe has scared American investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome are still not in force.
Industrial production slowed down on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing at its source a crisis caused by indebtedness.
General relief may not be imposed on the changes of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has been half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of the standard values closed with a decrease of 0.6 percent to 12.078 points.

Companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, as Eurostat’s statistical office reports.
What created skepticism among American investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this caution, it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for the CNBC.
That is why, in his view, it is too early to invest in state borrowings or European banks.
Instead, it throws away a decade of old principles and enters the American technology sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the listing of the shares of the traditional consortium and makes it quote against the market trend at first just a higher percentage.
The value closed almost unchanged at $187.35.

Smart Grains Spread in Cities
In many places the grasses are considered "problem birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grasses belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors about the filth and the noise of the animals accumulate.
Although no media has appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
Grajos no longer leave the cities, experts say at the first symposium on Grajos in Leer, Eastern Frisia.
There specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grassland; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, the growing building and the fall of trees that host them make it difficult for birds to live.
Grains are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 he leapt to negative headlines in the press a controversial project to mass kill the district's grasses.
Critics have described the hunting of animals through bird traps and the killing with sticks as especially brutal.
"Expulsing them and driving them away in a normal way nothing is achieved," said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting nests with water or throwing trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals deviate, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Expelling them is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes, or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities is not solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals from sensitive residential areas and baits to settle back elsewhere is possible.
"Informative panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against it in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a peak in the face with lead."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on the Ascheberger Grains, where signs report on the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion about criticism of birds' noise: "Everything is a form of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grasses not only take advantage of the resources to access schist bites, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked four farms to see how far the intelligence of birds goes.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second essay, the cunning granjos had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
Birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket on the tube shooter.
Three of the four granjos got it on the first try.
Portugal at the Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the latest notes for the Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the one-way match, made the five Euro Cup participations in a row.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs return game with outsider Montenegro, after in the one-way match (2-0) they made things clear.
Croatia did not let him score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored Portugal's other goals.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South Africa World Cup play-offs.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal began in a perfect way.
Ronaldo ran a live free ride from more than 30 meters to get to the head at the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to score from afar and got 2–0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not show up in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, leader of the Englishman Manchester City sent a head-on to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek was right for the Czech Republic
Next, the collegiate Wolfgang Stark, of Ergolding, was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pierced a controversial penalty following an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished the last doubt in the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth time in a row for the Euro Cup.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal at Tomas Sivok's own door (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the front turn, very right at Cech's goal.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the largo from the world-famous goalkeeper, FC Seoul's forward again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the match.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the marvel of Zagreb football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hidddink had to abandon his seat on the third-party bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation in the Euro Cup final.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance shot, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. Attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball inside the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia became increasingly in control.
After the break, Croatia did not let any goals be scored.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made room for Ivan Perisic, of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (München Bayern) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Euro Cup
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate the first participation in the Euro Cup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who triumphed with 4–0 in the one-way match prepared for a previous decision, he took the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
From the first moment, the Estonian defense avoided possible lead goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he beat it.
Following a defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and shot the ball across the line, getting the 1–0.

Massacre at the personal level
Peter Englund's Intense and Generous New Book, The Beauty and the Pain of Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about World War I, "starts with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one drop your soul at your feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently rip this page off and turn it into your brand page.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelist narrative, and this personae dramatis will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is a rare book, which he rightly describes as "an anti-history work".
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
"The beauty and pain of battle "combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go mad or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones add to the mix while others go out.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench war on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" moves expertly through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book fall on hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, do you stay or run?
Who's coming anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what's going on, or even why this war has to be fought.
"Factlessness," observes Mr.Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The Beauty and Pain of the Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the offshore fleet.
His stories have mostly been obtained from memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of little moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and dealing with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says, "Substitutes, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about sucedane food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed in ram fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, he observes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are conceived for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whisky, the afternoon paper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starched and studded breastplate."
Instead a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once one resigns to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public," he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar "to a condemned man being strangled in secret".
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in good clothing who executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both ignoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund speaks of soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the gonococcal pus trade, which soldiers buy and embarrass with it their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often results in lifelong blindness."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war to "unrelenting exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels such as Unnew on the front of Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a nonfiction play.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he came from his book, ripped that page of personae dramatis from your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a false foreplay, a planned assault by the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen Monday to Tuesday night because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underlined how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
Episodes of recent weeks, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, violating department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the "okupas," could not be repeated.
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park from protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves by seeing the occupations developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti.
The officers increased the so-called disorder training - counter-terrorist measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park came in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
A reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters came up early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who usually flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when the fewest number of people were in the park," he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with spotlights and speakers were congregating at the Pike Slip junction with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
Lights and pre-recorded messages rumbling from speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windbreaks, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No tent was touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving time to protesters to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that attempts were made to prevent the police from taking action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the officers.
Mr. Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved westward through the dense tangle of protesters' personal effects, including luggage and paper and plastic garbage bags packed with clothing, teams from the Cleaning Department followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, images appearing on the Internet shortly thereafter.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people at the epicenter of the camp were stranded between them by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disruption of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's head of detectives, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not leading the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block to the south.
From those positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a series of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalized.
Support workers union will sue city over layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon available to the union, from the 37th municipal district, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the city's worst paid lost their jobs on October 7, in a movement that union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, the city access to a healthcare fund run by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget approved in June.
One Council member counter-attacked by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be dismissed.
District officials 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers laid off as plaintiffs, all of them Black or Latino women, as well as most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city's Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees, as they had been undersubsidized chronically.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.S. The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also claims that secondary school principals may have been misled by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, despite the fact that "surplus" more often describes the act of transferring a school payroll teacher to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired," says the draft complaint, "and not just in surplus."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats at the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar the Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and America's involvement came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "valentity."
"This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya, as they begin rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties were fighting each other and the White House over the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain filed a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a large bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not angry enough to actually reap the grass under his feet.
The Congress's indecision was then overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to freeing themselves" and "welcomes the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide legislators as did the June bill?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's leading Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is voting this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The bill, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that will "control federal spending."
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but give their sponsors - especially novice Republicans seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of such a move.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can serve, while representative José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York), wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of states.
So enthusiastic that members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they do now.
The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting.
Ten months after a gunman shot him point-blank at a constituent act in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (Arizona Democrat) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang accompanied by the Broadway melody "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and punctured the left side of his brain, and passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41, replied, "Pretty well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special show, which aired on the eve of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special program analyzed Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers upright, while her husband cheers her up.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head move.
A furrow of the lips.
And then his first word: "What."
In a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast", a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who two hours ago of therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading Giffords an article in the newspaper about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been hit.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever."
Troops make you feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines stormed their posts around him.
The etiquette crowd stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They showed them as some kind of orphan child," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they did.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was pity.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken over the military and a often distant American public, sometimes worshipping.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, members of the service say.
The public is increasingly acting like it's sorry for those uniforms.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the audience they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity are held in silence and in private among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from fighting with the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an "angry and violent veteran below the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to endure under the pressure of demanding Washington work immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to cope with negative impressions," Cancian recalled telling his children.
Military unrest arises, in part, from U.S. indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praises of politicians and the public are largely focused on the depth of suffering of a member of the service.
Troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was headed back to his barracks at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
"An alarm signal sounded," says Lyman.
However, the native of Texas set aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision at a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of the soldiers' constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the army's senior flat, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a top-down structure," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, you will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damage suffered by active-duty personnel.
"The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs' military service," the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two thirds of them have died in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing her of discriminatory practices in the way she handles benefits claims for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a number of corrections.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported, according to the Department of Defense Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response.
However, the attacks are notably underreported, and according to Pentagon estimates, which figure at approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of reported cases in the army went to trial - half as much as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case, describe his attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
In the case of Lyman, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 different times to a multitude of police, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and the blood of her assailant - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the living room."
"They put me in the psych ward, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't their trial. That was my trial."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was dispensed from service under less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case filed by Lyman and his co-defendants continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as responsibility.
And he adds, "Probabilities are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go its way, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will put his other hundreds of plaintiffs in line for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just log in to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't that hard to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British DEMOS study centre.
Facebook's personal information cache is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific precision - the way vendors have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed advertisements to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes towards violence, and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way to do an investigation," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
DEMOS' work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "Likes", messages on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom, boosting the number of academic works with the site's name on the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to poll people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that university students who spoke of their drunkenness exploits on Facebook had a significantly greater risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student post too many state updates with their drunkenness.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development Center at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "punching" its own population to get data.
The site's Data Team has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - advocates of digital freedom long ago who argue that the site should make its large amount of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study he conducted with students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there's the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that some of the information from a user's profile and from the wall's messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and pen remain the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for getting into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of social still happens offline."
"Cold and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik Makes His First Public Appearance in Court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo courthouse.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Templar Knights of Norway," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I am opposed to the court, as it was mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a speech written in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned him from access to the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
They all attended with the aim of moving towards completion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian radio station NRK.
"It was awkward, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked the journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a major "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be comforted that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a relative of a victim.
"It'd be a lot easier if it seemed like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview Shown in a Theater This Week
Following the death of Steve Jobs, on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently rediscovered which has been dusted off as a preview of a series of special screenings in the larger markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a designer, dreamer and self-recognised hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a junkie of flowcharts - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease consisting of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds over the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for over an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he already worked intensely at his new computer company NeXT, awaiting popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full copy was discovered at VHS in the director's garage.
This archival material, slightly reissued, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview that arrives at the Landmark cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technology philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing him to go faster towards the most important issues or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It's one thing to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the Jobs that we see here, the eager dreamer on the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, it was and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that they invariably give you are, "Oh, that's just the way it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs brings your efforts to simplify Apple's accounting in detail.
Disconcerted by the way in which the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of a good cubier, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and shouting through the pay phone and returning a minute later to the pay phone next door," Jobs says with a giggle.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an amazing lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling it over the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call to him.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a little cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with him.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste my time with that machine and write programs for her.
On improvising innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of motherboards, a customer asked him if he could assemble the entire team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, he had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and left and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's revival, Jobs prophetically foresaw how many industry leaders would stumble into their vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers and printers, so what?"
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is these kinds of people who end up running the companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The product genius that led to that monopoly position rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could've been ten times its size, it could've been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't make electrons do, glass makes them, robots make them, factories make them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end everything is reduced to taste - it is reduced to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has ever done, and then trying to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been embarrassed about stealing big ideas.
What made the Macintosh big in part was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who by chance were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health care law rivals while the court accepts the case
The day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept President Obama's health care law challenge, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were given at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to accept the lawsuit and, in fact, a historic plea of five and a half hours is expected by March, and the outcome will likely further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court's decision becomes known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claim that the law must be dismissed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has long been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another signature that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
Dinner was held in a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the healthcare law.
Special guests at dinner? Mm-hmm. Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal magistrates.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which states: "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or be on the agenda of such an event. "
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several magistrates who abide by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
"The judges were entertained in a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say they mix the court's activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the attorney general of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law to now be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that he will.
Boeing receives a record $18 billion request
Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777 double aisle aircraft, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at over $1 billion.
Rarely is news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer and the selling price for the 50 aircraft amounts to a record $18 billion.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a growing gold mine of future orders for aircraft.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order ever for commercial aircraft worth in dollars - 50 double aisle Boing 777 jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so damaging, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
That is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The UAE's request solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide fuselage aircraft market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS's attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger plane at bay.
Boeing's win at the air fair comes four months after Airbus said he was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares went up 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote in Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón says the drug traffickers helped his PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the gubernatorial contest.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the violent state election, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... They seized the ballot boxes, set up barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly overtaken Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate from his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, came in third place, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderón's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidates out of fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the elections in Michoacán may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, in view of next year."
ADB Urges Asia to Help Rescue the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world's two largest fastest growing economies had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "impartial" way and said that Asian financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview within the framework of the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU bailout fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power for Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from the fall in exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when faced with their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India's billion two hundred thousand people, up to 800 million of whom live on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not go well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid Greek public sector workers, in jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss-making companies such as railways.
Mr. Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces "downside risks" due to Europe's threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed up Congress on Monday, warning that the upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a chain financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional reduction of $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Arizona Republican Senators John McCain and South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham.
He said Congress' failure to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping," would result in 23 percent overall reductions and a halt to many new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible to execute - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials inadvertently and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to discharge civilians in order to meet the target."
"These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the good disposition."
The cuts over time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"While wartime funding in overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in base budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that supports the war."
"The payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result with which one can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose ourselves."
"Hijacking is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it must not be allowed to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter and recent senators' warnings will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, even though she came to work at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that she was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in her opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries."
"Indeed, he invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions "generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously engaged around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter aircraft, a planned new bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and additional testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step in improving and addressing potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses of lying to the other.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "caught" with an open microphone stating to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself with his denials quickly refuted by irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given the test responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere 10 to 200 times.
Surely, many of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies," is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades at prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been refuted.
Liars do look in the eye.
They don't always stutter, babble, blush, or get restless.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and times.
I spent several years surveying scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, handling their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-oriented lies," while women say more "oriented towards others" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than people who are not married (but the lies they usually say tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called creating a baseline.
Helps to provide benchmarks for later measurement of changes.
Observe the subject's posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
You'd better know if someone normally bangs on the foot all the time so as not to make unfair accusations when he sees his feet beating in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive, verbal, and nonverbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavior groups as warning signs, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the top of the body by trying to remember its history, can point their feet toward the door, lean toward a way out, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a "post-interview shock" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and posture change once all the difficult questions are over.
Interrogators often falsely show that the interview is over just to seek that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up to the bottom and used past time as he claimed his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... to what I know... to my understanding."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted following the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline planned from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating unions, while appeasing environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada manager Alex Pourbax says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This follows the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes that avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater, are considered.
"This is a real path of progress," Rep. Lee Terry, Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may set aside any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's request, and expressed his full support for them.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He would bring 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta Province to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would need to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have opted for the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact study found that the project only raised limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said the department's inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to throw up in fear
A New York family claims that the disco music diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, scaring her little daughter to the point that she threw up in fear.
The diatribe of "Lady Marmalade" singer frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "further increased her fear of strangers," her family says in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 of last year when stageman Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Someone came up from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said "yes' and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman angry.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "He shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
He had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle on me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle pounced on the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and removed to a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loudly that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get an answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her behavior," Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it comes to a kindergarten teacher holding an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity stopped the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's administration, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, reduced foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled of change, that generated high expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost affects, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was sustained in 582,835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main crops being those of vegetables, maize and chickpea.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55,053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate rose to 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that in number of people leaves more than 74 thousand Sinaloans unemployed, an increase compared to the first semester of 18,969 individuals.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a resource restriction by legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who illegally grab dollars it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and secondly because entering they already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labor lags are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
FDI contraction
Combined with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the biggest decline in direct foreign investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of the state FDI totaled 630,697 dollars, representing a drop of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143,312 dollars recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the state government asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reviving the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés' government shows a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he lacked the harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the terrain that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, it failed to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events like the frosts of the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to prosecute the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resource be detonated," he said.
Work to be done
The president of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better directs the government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the government has been trying to achieve good results in various areas, there is some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He's sentenced for 8 kgs of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted narco-menudist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in his variant possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the 80th pillar, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narco-menudist was circulating in a white pick-up truck, where he was carrying a black bag in the vehicle box and in the co-pilot's seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was placed at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person remains in the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Must contribute to works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of municipal social development indicated that although so far the work programmes have advanced, they are at risk because the State Government has not fulfilled the contributions due to it, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so that the possible delay in their completion becomes effective.
"It is almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part," he said, "we in order not to delay have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not comply with the contributions due to them, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not provide at that time.
"It happened to us in the previous six years because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending," he explained.
Although there is a commitment by the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, has been asked to speed up efforts to ensure that their respective percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth."
Valid "analogue blackout" cut in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog to digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional disputes between the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue blackout" from 2021 to 2015, by not gathering the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be followed to realize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for failing to reach the eight-vote qualified majority for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and the decree remains in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and upon admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without going into the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to be prepared.
"I also do not think that if I did this it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, who has the constitutional mandate, the governing body of the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, resulting in better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision of public interest, which has not only a technical dimension, "since it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the executive, in issuing the contested decree, which in some way encroaches on the sphere of competence of Congress, as compliance with the laws issued by the legislature is being provided in the administrative sphere, he said.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data provided by the PREP, the difference between first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local norms with federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the current electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines provided for in the Official State Newspaper Law, on the grounds that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislature and called the state president's vote on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal," since he has no right to "sanction or veto them."
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to make partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may occur in the event that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of counting and counting in the box file or it does not work in the hands of the president of the box; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the ballot received in all polling stations may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the presumed candidate winning the election concerned and the candidate obtaining the second place in the ballot is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the party and/or coalition representative who ran for the second of the candidates indicated.
The total count of the vote may also be made if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the presumed winner and the second candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was placed second, in which case electoral packages that have been partially counted will be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation there is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will.
Their ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, during Monday there were reconnaissances and a mass of réquiem.
According to his relatives, the lieutenant colonel's last will was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving a tribute from the other people killed in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the people closest to them attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At 12 noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the sailing chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 in the afternoon he was given a recognition at the Instituto Tecnológico de Saltillo organized by his former colleagues from the technological baccalaureate and the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was part during his baccalaureate preparation.
"His will was that he should return to Saltillo and that his ashes should be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, he always said so to his family and his friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, considers that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was a successful man, extraordinary as a father, as a son, a loving brother and on the lookout of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo city very young to enter the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he even got dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, like the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: flying an aircraft.
They give him the last good-bye
With honors was fired the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, in tribute that led the governor Jorge Torres López, and that surrendered to him town and government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, directors and students of the Technological Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and stood out in both study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past few days when the helicopter that the piloted collapsed, along with the Secretary of the Interior, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of that unit.
At 1805 hours the remains of the Saltillense Bacio Cortés (creamed) arrived to be handed over by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the campus, where he was already expected by his relatives, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
They locate three abandoned bodies on Cadereyta NL estate
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and shot with grace, in an abandoned estate in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery occurred at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place observed that in the fifth, whose wall is beige with coffee, was the gate wide open.
When they looked inside, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately notified the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore yellow shirts with dark denim pants, without shoes; next to him was another with white straps.
About a meter away was another guy's body with red shirts and blue denim pants.
The three of them were face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three people were reportedly killed elsewhere, as no casings were found at the site.
In the bard of the fifth there are legends that are directed from one organized crime group towards another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Ministry of National Defence presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who were associated with kidnappings, homicides, hawks and clandestine burials.
According to the information released, in an initial incident on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, eight people were arrested and one person was rescued who was deprived of his liberty.
They were assured of three buildings and one cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".

By marking the stop and carrying out the inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently, following these statements, one of his accomplices was arrested on 13 November at 2 p.m. in the La Frauda ejido, who, upon seeing the military, attempted to escape.
They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present the president with the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the battered confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian bosses Confindustria, told the press after meeting Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were considerably boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocrat majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure to warn that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations, on Monday.
He'll end his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels among the uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections advance.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be made up only of technicians, an indication of his objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The touch of the Spaniards is superior to that of the ticos
Of the 22 footballers named from Spain, ten exceed 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side only one of the 22 summoned came to the 50 encounters.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, compared to the 22 called by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, count an extensive record of Class A interselection games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one with the 50 international matches.
That figure reached it the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity each year in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level clashes in European cups such as Champions League.
To this is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers of the Euro Cup and the World Cup.
Tico footballers, on the other hand, have a limited international touch in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish National Team is of the archer Iker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, the brain flyer of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centennials of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ram, Raúl González, with 102.
Nearly the centennial figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't come near 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar owns only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
The historic scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 targets, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in his two-decade-long celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday, at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also turn the dream of playing in the country into reality.
This was assured by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade-long tour of celebration and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside the angeline band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is on The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it's been great.
I have been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to get our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the previous days.
What do you say to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why is this?
I think it's partially because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting to people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us imagined we'd be in a great rock band and have done it for more than 20 years ago that seemed like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love creating music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the grunge's emergence?
It's always been an honor to be part of that big band.
We are very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a movement comes from a group of friends and it's unusual.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them yet and we're honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we are all fortunate to be still alive and, second, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance sheet?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance sheet.
We make sure we're not too much touring because it's easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without being infatuated by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very close friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing he can think of.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There's so many of them.
Among the first ones I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about bass players that I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about her, she reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's a wonderful thing because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and has now become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them to me, I cried when I heard them and they're deep dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs certainly represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that's dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is again admitted for medical examinations
Former president Alberto Fujimori was admitted Tuesday to a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his family doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a cancer in the language for which he has been operated four times and which is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, said he does not want it because he is known to be innocent.
He was operated on four times of cancer to the tongue, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos which has been joined by other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, the cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in custody since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that he operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico this Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican pair, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "property for the exchange of information on all political matters between the two nations," according to the South American country's Presidency published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group composed of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
In the commercial sphere, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigoted plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, untiringly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he has never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which reaches stores around the world this month, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support" , as so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experienced will be able to give a "second lap" to the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also implies the character's return to a portable console, a fact that did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winks at the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous installments, consisting of the mustache plumber having to tour platforms mined from dangers with the aim of releasing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he processed the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder US$70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the country of the north that demanded Portillo to judge him there.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account that an extradition order had already been issued by a sentencing court.
He claimed that during his term he "did not put his hands" in court decisions and processed all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done is an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted in order to prosecute the ex-mandatario from 2000 to 2004.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 youth at risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of boys without training
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the social support organization Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
To this is added the 100 long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in an event held in the former Fabra i Coats manufacturing complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradition or in a position to fall into marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of heads of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education advisor Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current ecosocialist councillor Ricard Gomà attended the event.
The current councillor of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the grand hall of Fabra i Coats.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example for being able to fight bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Evicted an okupada farm where they made macro parties
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm yesterday noon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday's noon voluntarily the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macro-fests that despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from recurring.
"From now on there will be an access control," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited-, took the entire electrical facility and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the mass parties, which lasted for up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club points out that the invaders of the estate made unfair competition, as they sold the drinks at three euros, while in the disco they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had had to respond to neighborhood complaints of noise, while, according to him, the inconveniences are not caused by the clients of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the okupada house and, above all, those attending the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The manager of the disco explained that the inconveniences were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago she "forgave" him the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal PP group in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had last week called for "immediately dislodging the building to end the problems of coexistence and citizenship that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the occupied building, but over the last few months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some there have even been robberies.
In this sense he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivism that has been generated on the estate."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police proceeded to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond polemics on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this administration printed some promotional packages for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was once again placed, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but above (mountain) -below (sea).
Collserola's rating as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these were until, in September, the city council convened a megacompetition composed of 16 contests for so many other doors of access to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone's trying to put doors in the field.
The question goes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both because of its purely organizational aspect and because of what supposes of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme to be touched upon when two members of this former caste of elect are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to debate about "the mountain front", since the discourse of Ildefons Cerdà, that of green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is possible to start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "Door of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": they should not be thought of "as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where you have to act".
Mòdol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainness that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that he had in the area of the Forum "his singing of the swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
"Limiting something is already setting the next step," i.e., its overstep.
"We have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (PMM)] can give rise to real disasters."
Closer to the question, Mòdol believes that, simplifying, the valley slope of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", by a purely topographical question.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not fall into a broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the council offers its union to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows the architects to enter into the debate, but "doubts" about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a great success", he points out) that they have had to create: "Architects should be only a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest lacks a global vision of Collserola: "There have been convened 16 transversal contests -he says- in the sense mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least where appropriate, that it has chosen to take part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the architect next door.
In his view, however, the City Council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, to its full extent, for an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonah Larrazábal and will go free
After 72 days of taking root, the legal representative of Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that followed him for alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted him the pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonah allegedly demanded that he pay an economic fee so that the regional council would allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
Following the public complaint, the State Attorney's Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the PAN mayor and on September 2 he was arrested and ingrained for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Office Agent 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to Arraigo House 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the 49 days following the issuance of a second rooting order after the Public Prosecutor ' s Office dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta prison for allegedly blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with 1.5 million pesos; however, he remained only for a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was given an arrest warrant by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that almost two months after investigations, sufficient evidence was verified to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing the operation of the latter.
On Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the royal mayor; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal process, the Public Prosecutor's Office officer attached to the court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the gambling associates was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the 197/2011 file, Jonás Larrazábal is granted a legal pardon and no complaint may be filed in connection with the proceedings that followed him, in addition to the fact that he will not be required to make reparation for damage or punishment.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the gambling house, around 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The court clerk, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison in the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be filed.
He will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results released on the accident where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage".
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so he had the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that research done in the impact area does not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no pieces or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter's design was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain presents a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results before possible; however, the research may last several months, it could even reach one year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff operated in cruising speed and that this happened in an ascending soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, SCT headline Pérez Jácome listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations the flight was carried out under the visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports at the AICM placed conditions suitable for take-off, as the aircraft progressed towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, layers of cloudiness were present at low altitude.
Selected paths:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew have sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft match, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and side path.
The aircraft ' s pattern of debris dispersion suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the accident, no evidence remains to be revealed in the ship's remains of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above the average sea level, the terrain presents a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he presumably disarticulated along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the cordoned site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which reinforces the presumption that the impact was presented under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security directs research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Childhood Obesity and Adolescence' protocol, which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research, the population is invited to participate, whether they are entitled or not, to go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out for minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Quauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of West Mexico) and that since October 8, the activity has been carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (State of East Mexico).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (southern Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On November 14, World Diabetes Day, he said that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure intake, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic levels are applied to all participants (we seek to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight there was also a dramatic rise,' noted the specialist of the IMSS.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others because of its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors hand it over in writing to parents, who are explained to each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transportation instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt of UNAM would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is the right one, the potholes could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
In his lecture A technological opinion of potholes, given in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory in charge develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called Maltese, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the pebbles that constitutes the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
When passing the vehicles and generating efforts, this allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, he abounded, he placed a last layer called a rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it should have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the way.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also requires to have the appropriate thickness and should take care of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil moistens, the water diffuses inside the folder and it is difficult to leave, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, the first to wear out is the bearing film and only after the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to the first signals with proper maintenance programs.
The member of the National Investigative System explained that vehicular load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicular load and ensure that it is fulfilled, in order to avoid frequent bumps forming.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already in the market and allow repair of potholes with ease and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title as a princess.
Once again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire of Miss Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and the scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallecaucan women who have been near the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question many are asking is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why?" made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Leamos Literary Carta.
To the questioner the Vallecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I believe quite a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think the book that marked me in childhood is "The Little Prince," it's a pretty deep book.
Currently I read "Crime and Punishment", is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a most beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
An answer that was not liked first by the term "culturalizing" and second by not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she manifested feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise happens what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses put forward it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotan journalist hinted that being the favorite, the ovationed and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best artisan costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and so did not shine on the stage."
And that was noted in his first swimsuit presentation on the Hilton beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although he looked safe in both, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the RCN Canal Como en casa program, said that the fact that Melina was designated princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain queen".
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For some reason, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest they are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of his defects in the derriere and the fibrosis that was evident in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, dropped points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos considers that the error of the Vallecaucana were the surgical interventions that were carried out.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her strong suit and here she was charged."
For this award, which for the first time presents the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuits emerged a cruel vacicinio that was fulfilled last night, because it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo granted Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that since today Melina begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, dodged her crown.
This was the work of the caleño who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Cali lophoscopist went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a CTI lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top Farc chief: "Alfonso Cano", through the collation of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the STI section, Eliazar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years, was on "availability" that week.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days in the jungle to get to the place where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after completing the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of the frictional skin, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar he was warned to wear minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry the decadactillary card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the chief of the FARC.
In search of the footprint
For a Sijín de Cali dactyloscopist, the recognition given by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin of error, that can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, the lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the persons captured.
When captured, many criminals present false cards or have no papers.
We took their fingerprints and looked them up in the database.
The researcher said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the criminal, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Prints can also rule out or reassert suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a print on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the crime scene.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that in objects "the footprints are extracted with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the STI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the television show CSI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective comparison is performed.
"Indignados" Challenge New York Authorities · Global Voices
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part responded to the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to reenter, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square from where they were evicted at dawn and by trying to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the "indignados" to return to camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court doesn't allow us to go back to camp in the square, we're going to settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen of the Ocupa Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indignant" to the eviction from their camp personally issued by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, linking New York and New Jersey, and owned by Trinity Church parish.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, while assuring Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization claims that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved to show support for the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square, which is a privately owned compound, is still closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning should be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters carried and handed out copies of that court order at this hour and even handed them over to the officers guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes," Bray said, who reported that some officers beat the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or banning protesters from accessing the park again with stores or other properties they used previously."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, whom he alerted, however, that local laws do not allow them to reinstall with tents and sleeping bags.
The governor personally defended the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law."
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people," as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," added the movement's spokesman, who accused the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression."
The leaders of "Ocupa Wall Street" also indicated that they plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months of the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", a lifeguard on "Baywatch", a bunny of "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the extensive online distribution of a pornographic home video in which she appears along with her then husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll depicting Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently performed as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "bitch" during one of her concerts in New York City.
Japan Reborn after Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the Japanese country suffered since World War II.
The Tokyo Government ' s initial estimates had estimated the material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seemed to have attenuated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to move on, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The one recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the upturn in the purchase of machinery to restore earthquake-torn areas and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to the decrease of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the true revulsiveness of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructures, using the deficits to grow from scratch.
Japan has waken up, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "shelter values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the cloudy US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the yen quote.
As the markets continue their siege of the EU's peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government does not let down its guard.
"We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa, yesterday.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member countries presented sharper signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
As it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro area was even below the average, which is at level 100, with eight-tenths rushing to 99.13 points.
Athens again fuels doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty reinstated in the parks, Greece continues to entangle itself in the maze that leads to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government comes more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by fact.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the one-hundred-day period agreed upon in his appointment may fall short of implementing them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not cast doubt on his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The Conservative leader went a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8 billion Athens urgently needed, and made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, which is still spelt out by the impact of the Ordago of Papandreou's referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "an unambiguous written commitment and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what it takes to pay the sixth tranche" of 8 billion, although there is also no definitive date.
The Greek hake still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place worldwide in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofía recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" she pointed out is that it lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened yesterday the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that has as its goal the reduction by half of the volume of people living with incomes below a daily dollar, with which the "poverty threshold" is fixed".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility," said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is proposed not only as a forum for discussion, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families have access to these financial services and 100 million of these households are expected to rise above the poverty line in which they are plunged.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link to this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "family head" assembled in Valladolid by the "baquero de los pobres".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this sense, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits represent "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it fall victim to the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluding those who close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been placed on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who consider that government policy is currently too tight with the Greeks and could be so with the Italians in the future.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were registered.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe".
This could be reflected in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to enable the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Without a doubt, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen Germany's weight.
Anxious for calming the mood within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither has she attempted to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not entangled France.
Except in passing.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a fund responsible for family allowances and give a speech on the theme, which has been recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aiding it.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the willingness to save rigorously, but still recalls a axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of absence on private sector workers before they can take leave.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' salary, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on staff members a day of absence without pay in case of leave from work (so far, they are not lacking, as opposed to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, most of them are also putting the issue of fraud on the table, this time directed towards the abuse of job losses.
"Controls will be considerably increased and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing a fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," said Xavier Bertrand speaking at the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in respect of work leave.
In fact, there has been constant monitoring of this issue since 2002 and a number of political offensives have been launched and have normally borne fruit.
The French don't get any more sick than in the rest of Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), more than €237 million was paid in 2006 in the form of unemployment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for casualties accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46 per cent is for maternity leave and work-related accidents, while 54 per cent is for sick leave, which amounts to Euro6.2 billion.
Thus, 2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that certainly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the professional management Syrian Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day's sick leave.
Another study, in this case of Assurance Maladie, indicates that in 2010 37 per cent of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between one and three months and 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (both for health and other reasons) was between 10 and 11 per cent in France, compared with 20 and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic monitoring of sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13 per cent of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be " appropriately adapted or unjustified; a total of 1.2 million were considered to be 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
No doubt, an insignificant figure in comparison, for example, with work in black.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, such a practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between €9,000 and €15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of subsidies for casualties and, undoubtedly, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos stated before Parliament on Monday, 14 November. He also added that the one hundred days given to his union government would not be enough to achieve this goal.
"To make efforts leading to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence to Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "major task" of the new government, since the country's stay in the euro area is "at stake", he added.
As a result, Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed Monday his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit itself to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with the deputies of his "New Democracy" party.
He noted that he agreed with the objectives of deficit and debt reduction, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee of support from all parties for the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras has replied that his word would be enough and that he would sign nothing because of external pressure.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized
Canadians live denying death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls on governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they wish to die and make arrangements to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and doctor.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code so that assisted suicide and euthanasia are allowed, when the patient considers this option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death."
On medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded by Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report had reached conclusions that did not coincide with the position of the Federal Government, which had already stated that it did not wish to amend the Penal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians, pro-euthanasia
Let us remember that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, as they believe that it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of the elderly or disabled have less value.
With regard to persons who had committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents were of the opinion that proceedings should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of a patient's health care, the situation is not so clear, as the authors of the report indicate.
Furthermore, among its recommendations, it suggests that the Criminal Code should indicate that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also calls for training of health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses end-of-life care without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls on governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in health institutions in Canada, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be regarded as euthanasia and be subjected to the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the findings of the report of the Royal Society of Canada experts.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of experts who sign the report as "extreme", among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and over 18 years of age can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she described as "manifesting in favour of euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, questions especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan’s King Urges President El Assad to Abandon Power · Global Voices
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is becoming more and more isolated
The Partisans of Bachar El Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bachar El Assad intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced the sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, have expressed their support for President Assad's abandonment of power.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bachar El Assad to "abandon power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime's forces has already passed away.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with regard to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the “strengthening of the Syrian consensus against Assad and the actions of the regime”.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the Dar'a region of southern Syria have already lost their lives, as announced by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and heavy machine gun shootings in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem considers the country to be "moving towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damasco from his duties, which in its view constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not waver," he added, ensuring that "the plots plotted against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his opinion, is contained in "paranoia".
A further extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of detained demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Serguei Lavrov, yesterday judged the decision of the Arab League as "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan from the crisis, although it did not express its support for the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday and today met with the trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of an extensive programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a deputy of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the appointed Council.
For his part, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament for a vote of confidence before Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation, by Mr Monti, of a limited list, undoubtedly of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its program, he said, adding that he is "sure that markets will have patience and will understand it".
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but concern followed, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team consisting mainly of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next legislative ones, he considers.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament by Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he is in office, he will work in the light of the urgency and with the aim that Italy "regains its leading role" in Europe.
A spokesperson for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance by 2013 despite austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for further stringent measures.
The "chief of the Italian bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot respect the requirements in terms of deficit".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place some €200 billion in state obligations by April 2012.
Russian scientist has collaborated with Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in developing a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
Last week the IAEA expressed its "serious concern" for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades since the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and had been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamancers" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Afterwards, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, according to one Member State to the Agency, worked for most of his career in nuclear technology in his home country's military nuclear program."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14 per cent overall increase in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and crimes have increased again," the human rights organization Human Rights First said, "the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds an organization's leader, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses," he adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted following the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin colour, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging Twitter site modified the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another one called "name" allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twittos", that is, of those netizens whose messages ("tweets") follow you on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if they track messages, if they are credited to new accounts, if they qualify a favorite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, as Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner has told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisater) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users have discussed with different opinions the interest of this innovation at the same time as tweets.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budget "golden rule" in the Constitution
On Tuesday, the Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in power in Austria decided to include in the Constitution a budgetary "golden rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann himself, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure far above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were to be reduced by a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional €3 billion in interest each year," said Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor of the Christian Democrats for Foreign Affairs.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries on 26 October: at the summit, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, by the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in an Act with equivalent value.
The Austrian Government's approach to the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the federal state's structural government deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we check that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historical peaks that resulted from the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been gradually going back since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "safe haven value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar requoted Tuesday to less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, since it prices the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of the income obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" following the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), Noda said, who fears that the rise of the yen will root out the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has regained growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the right measures", implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five trillion yen (47 billion euros), bringing to the 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
Guys grow up, bags falter.
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the most weakened countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the stability of the euro area, European exchanges sink a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"Taking into account the new tensions regarding the returns on loans from the euro area states most affected, stock markets around the world continue to yield part of their recent earnings."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market controllers regarding Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye on Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a narrow range of variations, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns for the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 hours, the European currency was worth $1,3570, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing, in particular, for the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates more than 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian bonds at 10 years reached 6.85 per cent, while Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions regarding the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the interventionists.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in spread rates between 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historic peak.
Pending growth figures in the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, which is a more favourable figure than the 0.3 per cent expected, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has revised the second quarter figure downward, with a 0.1 per cent reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has registered a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is one issue that cannot be addressed taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is appropriate for an electoral meeting to be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The discussion would be useful only if it considered the full economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic developments will double electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the increasing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, not forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case with Belgium, which subjects its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor with Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art power stations.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite a few examples, are continuing with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power station interrupted after the crash of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such a discourse.
The choice of Berlin will lead to an increase in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
Consideration should be given to the case of Denmark.
European champion in the wind sector, from which he obtains 30% of his electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittance of the wind; for this reason, his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheapest electricity.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would detract realistically from the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, they do not object in principle to this type of energy, according to surveys.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost construction of an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets that can create non-localizable jobs.
If France were to decide to abandon nuclear power, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva's development of low-CO2 and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a safety authority which exercises strict and transparent control over both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three major accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not have consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, just as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While being studied by all the electrical actors who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to Areva and EDF's competitors, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a debate that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "human rights country".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see Libération newspaper of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take over all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande merely includes banalities, indicating that co-development will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may prove to be electorally profitable, but economically it comes out very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restriction of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly low-skilled workers, by pushing for lower wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact more complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly employed in sectors with no employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and those that are more skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country lacking anesthesiologists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive impact on the salaries and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1% in migration flows represents an increase in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized US Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 years will make a net contribution (income less expenditure) of 150,000 euros to average public budgets throughout his or her life.
At the beginning of his tenure, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go and look for the growth points he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to vote as directly as possible.
We know, from Napoleon "the Little One", that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a twofold revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be reflected upon in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a halt to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take any action, but a common, full-fledged, calm and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is folded to the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers a humiliation at the international level.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
What is most urgent is that popular sovereignty should regain the helm of the European project.
Because it is only together that Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
A solution to the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead to a new deadlock.
We must take on a new stage in European integration.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The Interest-Motivated Revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
Only by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people's sovereignty, can it be achieved.
To build Europe, let us become Europeans.
"Contactless" chip cards are generalised
The world chip card show starts Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for common transport or purchases simply by bringing the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million non-contact chip cards will be sold worldwide, $320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (a projected 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million non-contact Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To get the upper gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
"There are two major French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically disseminating contactless bank cards to their customers in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile phone payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is indispensable for conducting transactions.
"They're falling behind."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Crédit agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a cover that allows payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the long suspected Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Mesahel, even stated that Algiers already "has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports demonstrate that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the runways.
Raptured in a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates a number of interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues particularly attracted the interest of the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "supports" had become increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and discourses or in his operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since pressured Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened little worthy of interest.
Fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the partnership is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the sharia, while its militants throw themselves into the fight against the unholy central government.
The latter focus primarily on churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as it usually happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, United Nations local headquarters became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, ranging from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is a matter of concern to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and stated that he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have increasingly made loud and short-cut statements on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the Grand Old Party nomination, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulating their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former Obama Ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost chokes on an attitude that "flashes" emotions.
He called for a strong, but constructive, dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Reagan-style
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if the sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
"If I get elected, I will stop Iran," he boasted.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-ranked candidate, shows shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "attempts to develop nuclear capability", apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The current President's opponents answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it as weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The people judge Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden, in a rather positive way.
From Iraq, he distrusts the military interventions that lead to a sinking.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama seems to be more just.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia via the Baltic Sea bottom, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic coast, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that connects directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and their Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have turned together the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, each year an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive in Western Europe through a first had 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012 to provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, i.e. sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous play presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, preventing the passage of land by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
All of a sudden, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be harder to influence Russia by threatening it with closing access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has achieved greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of energy Europe, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has been able, in just five years, to win its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically unites us," François Fillon confirmed during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major contracts in the gas sector are as political as well as economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom managers, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it from anchors on ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
In order to build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream society.
It was also necessary to strengthen measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its full length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in the waters of Sweden, but those responsible for the project renounced it when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state company to establish itself permanently at sea off its coast.
"In case of a breakdown, we will interrupt the passage of the gas in less than a minute," Jens Müller says.
In the event of leakage, gas from the gas pipeline shall therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, since they have foreseen joints that, according to forecasts, they will have a leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, which carries out external inspections, as well as by means of a device circulating inside the pipeline.
With the shape of a cigar, it is inserted into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
To it, the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture, Nord Stream, to build and operate the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to the company, for a period of 25 years renewable, the totality of the gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," Jens Müller says.
Financing for the construction of the gas pipeline has been carried out by 30 per cent with the contribution of shareholders and 70 per cent through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone takes the risk of spending.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a notebook of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first few years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed, has remained a long way off.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The Italian small business, which had twelve workers at its inception, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with Moleskine's development: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard tapas, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer covers... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disheartening?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Managing Director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable.
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, much remains to be done."
It should be mentioned that the disabled unemployed continue to face numerous barriers to employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 (on average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 per cent have not completed their baccalaureate and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared with an average of 38 per cent.
In other words, there are numerous issues that make it particularly difficult to return to work and that "constitute the crux of the problem," says Christian Grapin, General Manager of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mentality progresses, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the Cité pointed out that the directors surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually deficient".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the target of hiring 6 per cent of disabled workers, a target that was set in a 1987 law.
According to the latest available figures, which date back to 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6 per cent.
"We now reach around 3 per cent," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created a great deal of pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with 20 to 49 employees have disabled employees in their workforce, compared with 82 per cent of companies with 100 to 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We will not dare to say that there was collusion among them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side, on the stand of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made amends.
Five months after his striker's spiteful gesture against Turkey, the Belgian picker has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's striker replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it's a set", has been justified.
"In Lille, I'm here all year, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I have to place myself."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shield".
Not forgetting the "pleasure."
He has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
This will certainly particularly reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to "pride".
"Pride" for contesting "a gala match".
"Pride" also for checking, as "neighbor", that France "returns to a very high level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
"We're building something; the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You'll be able to see it in the next games." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal is facing with great optimism the party back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the one-way match, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; the Selecçao, which he has run since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Euro.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Considering the one-way match (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given it the tranquility.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't marked out of the house."
But at home, in the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be just as excited, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal", dixit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the match is very close, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to participate in the Euro 2012", said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
Bosnians could get a draw, though they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't marked out of the house," Bento laments.
"We are going to play against a team that has a high technical quality and has players with a high individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not leave them time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
