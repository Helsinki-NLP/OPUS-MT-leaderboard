Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American president in history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be awarded, among other things, for the exceptional effort to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have much to do.
First, he visited the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he would meet the five members of the committee that, in October, elected him between 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple is planning a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive him, although the third to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will speak of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to donate them for charitable purposes, but has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During their full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will attend.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not fully deserving of it.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".

Brno doesn't like bins too much to separate trash.
In Prague, the citizens can separate the packaging of drinks and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that in Brno the garbage doesn't separate at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in separating garbage, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing a bottle of PET into the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské náměstí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his companions get mad at me, but that seems too little to me.
Needless to say, it is not easy to separate garbage elsewhere either.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
For vagrancy
The thing is, the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several bottles of glass and plastic.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the trash was already overflowing with the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be of much interest to Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy from the city the hockey extraliga, which shames us throughout the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little bit, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM society, Brno is truly the worst in the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
"Paroubek's" budget took money from rents and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government's opinion, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sickness benefits or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, Finance Minister Eduard Janota says.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they trusted that the government would subsequently ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, rents or sickness benefits. "That only means postponing problems for the future, is laying mines," Janota says.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to pay back the money.
The state doesn't have much choice to make money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or State operating expenses, it must increase taxes.
To all whom the left now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, his children too.
People don't have to worry about rents or sickness benefits, they'll get them. 1.8 billion of these accounts disappeared.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; next year will not miss only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the effort of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase alongside interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come by slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity benefits, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the dislocation of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion left to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and neither can their price be reduced.
The maximum that can be done is to keep them, which is not free either.
This means delay or cessation of the 30 large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will get money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly state-owned, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe, nor is it a bottomless sack.
Last year ČEZ spent 18 billion on the budget.
Each year of dividends are settled ecological damage, serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
Moreover, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to award various compensations to the victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including in building savings.
It was unclear whether the State would need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, maybe we'll have to pay for it, says Janota.
Then, the Minister will have to save money inside the spring or, at worst, take advantage of the government budget reserve.
Another hundred million are still missing for the project "Státní pokladna" (State Box), which is worth two billion and has already been launched. It must allow you to monitor online what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will arrive, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
At the touch of a key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the objective of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile, you can carry two user profiles at once.
They will be able to change between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at once, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
VMware cooperates with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only do ski maintainers in Krkonoše worry about snowless tracks.
Lack of snow causes people not to book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, Krkonoše still offers free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they ask immediately about our opinion, whether this Christmas there will be snow or mud," said the maintainer of the news portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn according to their expectations should not hesitate to book their stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers in Špindler
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still open.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí's travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše as well, but there are fewer free places.
They are sold very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks remain snowy during the week, Christmas dates will run out too," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last squares off.
Interest increases during the Polish holiday in January and February is also sold well," reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are already occupied also at the Omnia Hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are about sixty percent of the occupation capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
For the moment, however, it seems that Krkonoše's hoteliers will miss out on the snow.
On Thursday temperatures must fall and, if there is precipitation, it should snow in the mountains.
But then again the temperatures will rise, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom · Global Voices
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent pupil repeats in the Afghan question his predecessor's strategy, which he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only does the same text use the "as in Iraq" speech several times, but it also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for his own statement: "A New Way Forward."
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today there is no talk of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively he left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't think of anything better, so at least he cheated on the general about 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama’s entire strategy seems his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years. Obama’s entire doctrine generated more questions than the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is implemented.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the chief every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. Patriarchal tribal relations will remain behind him.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated by confusing relationships, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is collided with his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of troop withdrawal is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are becoming less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback to the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years to go before the presidential elections and that is why there is still a long time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Bank managers Goldman Sachs will never receive cash bonuses again
The top executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to link bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer road to take, mentioned former bank investor JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Bank Goldman Sachs faced criticism after having set aside nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) for bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, 20 billion dollars.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced Wednesday that it plans to tax at one time, with a tax of fifty percent, bank bonuses exceeding £25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record number, today received this year's Nobel Prize-winners in specialized categories and literature from King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists, among the winners was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as fellow countryman Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This amount in each category is up to 10 million Swedish kroner (approximately 25 million Czech kroner).
In case there are several winners in each category, the prize is shared among themselves.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Prize winner, that of Peace, received him today afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are indispensable for achieving peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also Janota's tenure in the cabinet, is supposed to be the themes of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
President Radim Ochvat's spokesman reported on the appointment.
On his tenure, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the left's proposals for transfers of funds and increased the money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government on the other, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the SDG, ČSSD and the Green Party, are becoming controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Deputies, de facto liquidates the savings package, imposed in autumn by Fischer's government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he stated during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians have long neglected "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president says.
SDG leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
SDG Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the bureaucratic cabinet concept with the support of ČSSD, SDGs and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentiments".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by former Topolánek government. He will exceed SEK 200 billion.
Wednesday ČSSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular ones were happy, too.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle, and its victories, although some critics say the leading roles are played by American actors.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the slave abolition movement, the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to join the rugby players, who belong in the world measure to the outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
“I discovered that by tightening his hand, I receive his energy, it is transmitted and he had the feeling of knowing how you feel,” he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had had six months to prepare for a role in the tough rugby world.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his home.
I remember knocking at the door, he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "In the film I look much taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the actors' characters and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety magazine film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the Rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The Secret of Splendour Over Norway Solved: Russians Tested a Missile · Global Voices
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence finally recognized yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bullava" type missile, formerly meant to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimír Putin.
Even their repeated presence in missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but it shines.
During the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the apparatus.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a boat that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light about Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The Norwegians alike from the very beginning did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by stating that one cannot simply speak of failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines broke down immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without error, according to the Ministry of Defence's management only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to the generals and for that reason they continue to claim that "Bulava" one day will fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose total weight is maximum of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at age 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return at age 51 to a professional hockey match.
Former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play Friday in KHL's duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides over the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov constantly practices and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to settle some formal issues, quoted the AP agency to Sergei Nemchinov, the Moscow club's coach.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can cheer up the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest-serving professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary striker Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, throughout the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest in the group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and in the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he twice won the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Glory.
Hyundai met the union requirements. It will cancel all the extra work
The management of the automobile factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the unions declared Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift for this year.
We cannot resign ourselves to our manufacturing plan, because it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, we will work in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way its employees were motivated by the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or can take a day off on December 28th, i.e. extend Christmas holidays in one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees of Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the supplemental work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon decided immediately to cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Vaněk mentioned.
Car factory employees were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and trade unionists must be held on Monday morning.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday, that if they committed themselves to meeting the requirements and signed the document, they are willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the automobile factory worsened last week, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent additional work.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management was of the opinion that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The trade unionists in their statement of Monday's strike emergency also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday stopped manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, trade unions require the company to keep it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 kroner for this work.
The automobile factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial manufacturing was started last November.
Until last September it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in HIV 'streets'
Team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds to moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some already accessible medicines.
AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be significantly prolonged by a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the virus replication is not completely suppressed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metallocarranes have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarrans are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way from all the medicines used today, and so they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the albumin of the virus.
Metalocarrans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages composed of the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no division of the HIV virus and no mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of anti-HIV protease substances was performed in test pieces, and also against their resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarrans on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metallocarrans are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina
SDG attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDG chief Mirek Topolánek said the approved budget for next year is "scareful" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think of its future existence.
SDG statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say there's time left for the analysis.
SDG Vice President Petr Nečas said that the bureaucratic cabinet concept with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Nečas the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to lean on the minority, which tries to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democratization towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendments proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the SDG proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
SDGs before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the government's wish, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and the feeling of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota called for a meeting with the prime minister.
He pointed out, he's thinking of staying in the show.
The reason is his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government they have nothing to do with the nominees for the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, if the chamber passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to sickness subsidies, rents, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the SDG are not to blame
It's the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The SDG-nominated ministers have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the U.S. text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the lieutenant positions there are people who belong to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that he leans on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I have not thought about that, when the time is right, I will take care of it, told the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon went out to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
SDG ceded at Prime Minister's request
Nečas stressed, that SDGs on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister did not explicitly ask SDG deputies to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he reacted to the question, if SDG does not worry about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from the term of office, he knew that in the following months it was mainly about the bolshevisation of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new train schedule of ČD there will be fewer trains for almost the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will reinforce some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into effect.
Most rates including basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will win for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, dráhy for this line will add a pendolino road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not return to Bratislava.
On the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line there will be fewer fast trains, direct links will be restricted Prague - Letohrad.
In the regions, the largest reduction in planned transport by Drahy is in the region of Hradec Králové, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the track Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and some fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced only to a few days of week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the surroundings of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long distance links to the capital will end at Prague station Hlavní nádraží.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
As of December 13, travellers will not return to Bratislava in Pendolino.
This year's regional railways account: 200 million more than before
Fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive a total of four billion kroner next year, just as this year. Local trains are ordered by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion kroner in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast trains and local Drahy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always a year.
Drahy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why the prices of a large majority of the tickets did not rise.
Changes will only take place on one-day tickets - ČD Net and on cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card the ČD Net price will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 kroner for trips between any two regional cities.
Armed Filipinos continue to detain more than 50 people, children released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including a number of primary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only about 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The abduction took place in South Agusan province.
They say that approximately 19 armed men use the hostages as a live shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to surrender the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed men belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the kidnappers were previously persecuted by the police because of the violence, which caused the settling of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in Maguindanao province it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, that martial law was imposed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre, related to the governor's election, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, they renewed the peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
RSA's story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený) is released in American cinemas, which captures part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the leading role.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela . He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, together with Klerk's, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
high hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the world championship in football are culminating in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of leading roles by the "little interesting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman however says, he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as they say - collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the holiday premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also wears the suit of the national South African rugby team and enters the field. RSA won the world cup at the time.
By entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people join and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans however are skeptical, as he said in an interview just for LN a rugby amateur Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
Lounsko burns a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught in the morning a transformer from the Čeps company in a switch box near the village of Vikov in Lounsko.
According to Lukš Marvan, the firefighter's spokesman for the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, however they later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special fire extinguisher.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the transformer short circuit.
There were no injured, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokeswoman, the breakdown does not compromise the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps’ activity nothing similar happened, breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman of the ČEZ society for the northern Czech, the supplies of the electric current were not cut, and the fire of the electric substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps působí in the territory of the Czech Republic as exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the electric conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
Keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electric power from the transmission system to the distributor system, also maintains the electric conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a libel complaint against three ČSSD hetmans
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will file a libel complaint against three social democratic hetmans.
It is Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and the hetman of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in 20 minutes on Radiožurnál.
Demand has to do with the company's effort, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking raisins from the cake", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dráhy, which were fixed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It's about slander towards Student Agency society, he said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
He also mentioned having the evidence from all regions, and he said that they had not taken the necessary measures in line with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and appeal to the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose, that it will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, Hašek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million kroner in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures by the regions.
Radiožurnál told him, that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the commissioning of approximately 150 billion kroner did not convene a tent.
According to Jančura similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a ČSSD MP, due to his criticism of railway transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't stop, we can lose our bus licenses.
He ran as a deputy of ČSSD, I know, which one is it, I'm not going to say his name, said Jančura today for Radiožurnál.
Pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the compulsory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are complete.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also clear about this in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccinations for children born in August
From January onwards, children born on 2 August last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine has to be received between the third and fifth months of age of the child.
Last year a quarter of families voluntarily let their children vaccinate against pneumococcals.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 kroner and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand kroner annually on vaccines.
However, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state has spent approximately 500,000 annually on all vaccinations of children.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
From the pneumococal infections in our country every year 28 children not older than 10 years of age die according to research in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic the pneumococcal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be compulsory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccine could be compulsory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, said Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Its association has been spreading pneumococal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we have to take now, Kalovský mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
We do not think about it at all at this point, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských léka? Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, we can reason about reducing the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect, that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents let their babies be vaccinated against pneumococcals.
The pneumococal vaccine is also a big change because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save on treatment later, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
Pediatricians are concerned, however, about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "take out the money from health insurance."
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid for by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at US$20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police claim that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while carrying 90 paintings in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute may have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52, told the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta father denied granting such permission.
Labour Party Defends Budget Tax Increases
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements as of 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Unions have regretted that low-wage workers are being punished by a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by around £3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which claims that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PREVIOUS BUDGET REPORT
Social security with an increase of 0,5 % from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50% tax on bank bonds
The increase of 1 point of corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax relief for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 a year and whoever earns £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who earns £10,000 a year will earn £110.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60% of the burden of supplementary taxes would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and spending cuts outlined were a "sand grain in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures. It will allow us to cut the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour party's forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence the amount to borrow and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decrease predicted in April, while borrowing would be £3 billion above previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday, warning about the Labour party's "debt crisis," said that the projection of loan applications for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, avoiding "cynically" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything meaningful about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election, win whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour party insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek further reduction of the deficit in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sandcastles."
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that the timing chosen for the announcements, such as the rising inflation of some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to accusations of election maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour party insists that it is being provided to the people most in need and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 expenditure data, economists said it was clear that adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said the Finance Minister's figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defense.
"This is really postponing the pain to later," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, win whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to Deloitte accountants.
"This has been the false pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. embassy of Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Punjab province.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, USA, last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If you're American citizens, of course we're going to be very interested in the charges you've been arrested for and in what kind of circumstances you're holding them back," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," said the spokesperson.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said that the house was already targeted by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported; but said the US had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported his disappearance in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International Condemns Iranian "Abuses" · Global Voices
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been just as poor, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details the regime's "models of abuse," before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights record.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International cited the story of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election result.
"I often get punched in the face" according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, in my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and abandoned on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed to have been held in a container along with 75 others for more than eight weeks, in a detention facility in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the unrest of post-election and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee's inquiries had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski track was made in the city park
Over 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope at Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-metre-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was pretty scary.
You see it under a beautiful view of the lights of the city twinkling.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent," he added.
The awards were given for the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will melt.
Still them and us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Lay State.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and a widespread alert to the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Veils" (2006), an elegant and thoroughly argued study of a problem that divided and troubled the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France's 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that interest them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane questions, he argues, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of whom are renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not manage to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
Thinkers and activists Mr Bowen interviews tend to disagree with their Salafi counterparts, supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
He questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims probably have a more unjust treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives "a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The World’s Most Desolating View
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Cognizant of the complicated history and policy of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave proof of courage by confronting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a courageous 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured as they swam following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth of a wild adult’s area. The climate is almost never adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore turned green by algae growing within the hairless areas of his fur.

Ellis resorts to accounts from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat hunters pose to species survival.
Although banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters on helicopters and snowmobile Eskimo Indians use high-powered assault rifles to bring down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and an overwhelming look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not like scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It's not for lack of commitment.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering journeys in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave indications for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the cold war submarines drew a map of the moving ice cords that circulate beneath the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system inside the Arctic ice, formed by squirts of saline water that compresses while it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice is removed, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington tombs
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
“In a few months, from where we are being embarked, these could be us,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns in the graves of veterans in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the graves of Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late career military officer.
As long as her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving a retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to older graves in World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don't receive as many visits as the new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands, as they carried the fresh pine to the gravestones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud names carved on the stones, while others bowed to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers to wipe the tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Navy gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
"Much after my death I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who was distributing mobiles and laptops in the country, state department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything that is considered "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including minor protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has requested permission to leave the country to accept prizes on several occasions, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor can probably provoke tensions between the Castro brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow pace" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly misplaced.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobiles, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba itself," a reference to the location of Raul Castro as leader of the country, to replace his sickly older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case can help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who are going over the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube Internet video site.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been informed about the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, away from the imposing mountains of the north-west, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered to be part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men did not change and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps, when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who they trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people into al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting pass those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda looks at aspiring American recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they represent a huge appeal, because of their potential to access American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the United States-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years regarding those who admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?" said Kohlmann.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate "action"
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding that negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center, bolder actions for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the amount to be closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish stating, "The Earth says "Enough is enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips Peru, her mother's native country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country must deal with because of the impacts of the climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the wearing of masks or for carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified as being involved in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black attire placed several explosives near the main channel in Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they began as flares, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on the climate.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is great, I cannot hear what is going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of each to define whether the march was being detrimental or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence reveals persistent racial differences
Last week's federal grade book on math performance was very good news for the public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best performing systems, the grade book showed that fourth and eighth graders ran faster over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is recorded in recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent performance gap between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
Average scores for white fourth graders in the D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over an extension of six years, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between fourth grade white and black students in 2003, when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points from the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the gap has narrowed to just 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by attending to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization advocating educational equity in the District.
I am not leaping with joy at a difference of two or three points, said Council member of the D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elementary Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee's style of administration, said the message of the test scores is that the city's high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what is worrying is that we are not devoting the time or energy necessary for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue finding better ways to address the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students from the upper grades of primary and middle school, who did not master the foundations of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Daily mathematics, a math curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes real-life games and experiences, which was introduced in the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and yet provide additional money and resources for underperforming schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here's a kind of rough dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, are confident that their children will have access to excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element in ending the performance gap is to lengthen the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, which she considers as an "indicator" to seek a further increase in the next deal.
Making higher education a part of the future
The tour bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resounding.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12, went down and blinked for a moment before the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the group's other eighth graders explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
“This is where I will be!” Graciela, who would like to study medicine, exclaimed when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
“Wow, really?” he said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low teacher-student ratio of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day journey, and had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States to Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's workforce.
Those who analyze those with higher performance say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides over $300 million per year to local school systems, to implement college readiness programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements the Iraqi Ministry of Oil reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away having bid on only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer lost.
Two US companies reached agreements for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of US oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It'll be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military retreats, probably prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world's third largest reserves of crude oil, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have strengthened ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts granted this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and achieved large investments in contracts for two main fields.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman for the Assam Jihad Oil Ministry.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each field.
Al Qaeda's main planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed an al Qaeda main operative planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have passed away on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified CIA-operated aircraft inside Pakistan's illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading for the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official of Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shattered bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military planner, who led the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiring around the world, said a senior official, who spoke out of anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide from al Qaeda's top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had risen rapidly into the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a name known to some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat he posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led drone attacks has declined since the summer, from an average of approximately six operations a month to two, according to a recount by The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decline is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site said.
The UN's highest envoy in Kabul about to resign
The top United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was hurt by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's UN-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure occurs when the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months prompts other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who are collaborating with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but merely fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
“What I have said is that you better start looking for a successor,” Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, "surely hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also boosted the leadership of the UN to allow its successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermine his ability to attract talent.
So the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran to face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that, if we've learned anything from Iraq for the past six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives," "to persuade the Iranian government that they would be really less safe with nuclear weapons," because "their people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and agree to leave a substantial portion of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from tentative agreements, in part, the experts claim, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline of December 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including pursuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday "unsubstantiated and baseless accusations," by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue discussions with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning, before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq, to meet troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and partnership.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that lectured them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that, when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We've already given all our time and energy just for one child.
“We have nothing left for a second,” said Wang, 31, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of a single child in China, creating two generations of notoriously horny children, only spoiled children, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy became effective, according to the Division
UN demographic, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, has stated that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Written in the country's 1978 constitution, the policy of a single child of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labor discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have performed abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they attenuated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University's Institute for Demographic Research, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters ordering families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very un overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although rural city officials outside Shanghai argue that they observed a moderate increase in applications for couples who want a second child following the launch of the campaign, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu municipality's family planning committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want more children.
They want to give their first child their best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only the insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, such an option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view single-child politics as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yeah, we're being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources administrator, said he wants an only child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to having everyone take care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two careers, middle class, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it's about having enough success to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents' struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from the parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic one "must have a curriculum prepared for the best day care centers when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by defiant positions and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying on their shoulders most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a time-consuming negotiation, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not speak of how much money rich countries would give the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit to the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, Washington High Representative for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would cut their emissions over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50-95% by 2050.
The European Union also stimulated talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday presented the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated conversations last week.
U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, with regard to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei, claimed that America's top climate negotiator lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically cope with global overheating.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, the fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States confronting their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries of the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the bravest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are discussing who should pay for spending to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the major emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change advisor for Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, even if most of the main participants said that the talks would produce at most a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which has 43 members, prepared a proposal for a 24-page preliminary treaty early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government come to close a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and ran into the halls of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, so that they could delimit the claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists who play the guitar present night shows mocking the countries that they say are selling, and pass preliminary proposals from hand to hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for the global policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first train 225 km/h redefines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13 on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the switch from aircraft and cars to rail would reduce national coal emissions, as well as ease road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears over environmental damage, can still slow Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn up within a 25-metre radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The favoured option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another heading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said one railway member.
Once finished, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support trains of 400 mt in length, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate on an hourly London-Birmingham line.
This means that it would require a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the space restrictions of the capital, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first trains would be forced to leave fast lines along existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered to be the crucial point necessary to ensure a change from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face mortgage for an orange grove of £75,000 from a Conservative
Conservative Party spokesman Alan Duncan charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange grove he built in his constituency home.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that deputies lived "on rations", increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension at his second house in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the extra interest, adding up to hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said that the requests "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange".
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £271,406 from his London property to the home of his constituency, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before he became a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was applying for approximately £1,400 per month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase was to finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable mortgage rate of BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, which is now the rate.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for £1,250 per month in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as president of the House's opposition in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying deputies had to survive "out of rations" after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the sterling symbol on Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr Duncan said, "It was for primordial improvements, approved both by the wage office and subsequently by Legg."
He added, "It's not about evading and offending or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be any clearer or simpler."
Let those who have faith come to see the calendar of the Advent of Brighton beach palapa
Brighton's palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. every day, with stuffed pastries and punches served free of charge.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Fifty-year-old Martin Poole, a TV marketing assistant to Hove, is an unpaid clergyman from the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said, "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality."
Massive mobilization for climate in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in demand of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched through the frozen Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change will have to reach by Friday. It will enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization for climate around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the demonstration began in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with cobblestones and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, they are especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized in the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold."
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the venue of the negotiations.
Protesters stopped approximately 500 metres from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by coach and train from large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with celestial rain showers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" for "justice and climate".
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot keep saying: there is time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry, watercourses that you can walk through as never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, an anti-globalisation figure, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together many islands very vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red and wearing scarves with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protestors were formed to call for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 pm GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced Saturday to Sunday night.
The five running candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergueï Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting scrutiny.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili "deplores that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which resulted in several thousand deaths, Abkhazia attempts to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP that she had voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The subject of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the banks of the Black Sea.
Large planks show Bagapch next to Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the chief of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian leaders who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and most particularly the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
“I hope your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations,” replied Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives control of the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organised two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which until December 18 delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that will have to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
Protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle vigil.
A few moments after the demonstration began, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near a busy house during incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, police say.
We did not take our eyes off extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the demonstrators, who arrived by coach and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with celestial rain showers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" for "justice and climate".
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

Oxfam, along with former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together many islands very vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated in red and wearing banners with slogans for solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters were trained to take action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday's Informative (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would emerge "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all high school students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "suffer hypocrisy" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The branches General and Literary Teaching cannot be subramas of the C, he goes on to underline even: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged at having eliminated history and geography in second high school in technological schools".
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in second grade C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the second-grader program C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will take an admission test that will aim for their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
In addition, they will practice in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as trainees.
If you do all the practices proposed before the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose “the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education”.
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street College of Normal.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize laureate, opened the conference conference conference "Ernest", a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and convey to them the desire to know more, Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school pond, explained in the framework of the conference.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts of his discipline and selected them from his charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he said, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school's website starting December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Delay in payments: disgust among prison guards, planned to take action
Prison guard unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year holidays, bonuses and overtime, which was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Labor Force (2nd Guards Union) asked off-duty staff to join the demonstration Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block" them to denounce the theft of their assets.
The prison CGT (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "meeting in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", since it calls the non-payment in December of the "extra hours, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October "shameful and unacceptable".
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury".
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased greatly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellery reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Prison Administration to implement immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for the management staff who benefit from the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who "always blame the budgetary demands", deplored the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said indignantly the interregional union FO of Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when tasks and missions increase without taking more personnel, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the CGT prison of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the same is not true in all regions, as some are luckier than others.
But in any case, the result is not the one expected, said the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end of the year holidays in their new prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be from the game.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to the extracts of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, last year I made you nice gifts," she said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering humorously by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered his favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
“I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball,” the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the home, however, I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again intervened in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his close associates, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pains and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors verified "injuries arising from the operation" of hernia discal performed in Paris on November 26, he pointed out his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "need a repair operation."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquility by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pains and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about his condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Monceau Park international clinic due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection resulting from Delajoux's intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but said that he didn't get "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me right before he traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to get twelve hours of a plane after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, pretended to reassure him that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems multiplied since July when he was interned for nine days following a crash on his yacht.
Two months later, to a general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed having been operated on by a "colon cancer", after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Turn 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been exaggerated. Fans and journalists noticed the musician’s difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title in his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Long Pool Championships, won an international title on Thursday at a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 by short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimsuits were last allowed, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in relay 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who coveted the world record at 50 m free, brand owned by long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, at 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman prevailed with 20''53 during a final where they competed ten swimmers instead of eight as usual, a first internationally.
Bousquet beat the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I was going to try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits which from January 1st will be banned.
These swimsuits, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of swimsuits did not help German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark by 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he prevailed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up in this race.
I knew that this time I would not be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and I fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola sold at USD 1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art dealer.
This panel 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates back to the 3rd century after Christ, and its price had been estimated at between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunk women, is an unusual piece, since in the world there are only four or five", he explained on Tuesday to the AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bid by the buyers, without a doubt, pointed out to the AFP a spokesperson for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Only a few days ago, marble was discovered to be an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For nearly 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure for Mexico
On Thursday Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied the safe conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador Wednesday to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
To grant him safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to reach Mexico as the guest head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my post (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya said on Thursday to Globo radio, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been in the country of Central America for five months.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, refugee in the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted us an application for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain a request for asylum, the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
“I will not seek asylum from any country,” Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with the Telesur network, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military, on Wednesday.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
That reflects the marginality of this government against international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, when he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will be held accountable to the justice system for the crime of "high treason," according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial vote, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Feeds Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed in increase this Thursday, US trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the definitive figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the glass half full".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies trading with the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research company Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were filed.
But in the course of the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest since a year ago," Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors stressed.
The bond market fell.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% on the eve.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power boo the "Ladies in White" · Global Voices
This Thursday hundreds of supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted in the street by supporters of the Raul Castro government as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, said an AFP journalist.
The Yankees die!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raúl!" chanted with their fists the militants of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "protect them".
On the eve, a similar demonstration broke out against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for international human rights day, were arrested by police officers in civilian clothes, reported an AFP journalist.
The officers forced dissidents into the vehicles who were booed by government supporters, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, purges a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
Cuban authorities label opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" on the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
Made extremely rare in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by government militants against the "counterrevolutionaries."
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alienated man kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves five wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Seine) on Thursday at the hour of the largest influx in the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant reportedly beat an elderly man, at the pharmacy or in front of the pharmacy at No. 85 on Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, police sources and witnesses reported.
Following serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a head of the Alliance police union.
Then at the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, stepped in and was wounded.
The first two seriously injured victims were taken to the hospital where the elder died.
The life of the other injured, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
The pregnant woman then fainted and was admitted "in shock," a police source reported.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped along the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a thirty - year - old man, and another forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he had crossed his back, explained at the location a union leader Alliance in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alienated, according to testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, Alberto explained, a bartender nearby.
A crowd hit him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, at 61, two municipal officers, including the chief, attempted to arrest the armed man and were beaten to death, according to police testimonies.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured in the street.
“I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in the abdomen,” Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person of approximately 35 years of age arrived, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office brought the investigation under the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Upper Seine Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his pretrial detention, he has not spoken a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of placing him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "everyone disturbed of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
US: Polanski's lawyer calls again for the case to be dismissed
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again demanded this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, be dismissed for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney for the director of "El Pianista", reported to three judges of the Second District of California Court of Appeals serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I demand that the charges be dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "resolved chilling".
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before sentencing, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But at the end of September Wells finally declared that he had lied to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed to hold a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, i.e. that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his conviction for "illegal sexual relations" with a girl under the age of 13.
Since then, he never stepped back on the United States.
Los Angeles District Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to appear at the hearing."
“With this cause, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing?” Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "asks for a favor from the court, although he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to deliver their sentence, also highlighted "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one asking to dismiss the Roman Polanski case.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She maintains that her client no longer supports being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on a North American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his cabin in Gstaad, pending eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses its course and is slowing down by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed off this Friday aimlessly, in a market that is debated between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the definitive figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points reaching 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, of technological component, lost 0.55 points to be placed at 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced from 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of trade is becoming smaller and I believe it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained thanks to the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve the market's opinion as to the solidity of the economic revival", summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, American consumer confidence recovered visibly in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's preliminary index estimate.
However, the indices were slowed down by a further advance of the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which "leads to the downside of sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492% on the eve.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 Miss World title candidates are in the final stretch to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Sportsman or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
“I saw so many things and lived countless experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone astonished.
This event, which is held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast on Saturday live from Midrand, North Johannesburg, from 5pm (15h GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take their breath away".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, Miss World candidates concentrate on the pageant.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declares Miss India with a great smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, in swimsuits.
Chinese host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a committee leader Miss World, Steve Douglas, will conduct the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will certainly be the draw in Cape Town, Southwest, for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I tried people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
News about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," said his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1 pm local (21 h GMT).
The singer's son, relaxed, assured that he would move "as soon as possible" to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered Monday for an infection resulting from the hernia disc surgery last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered Monday for an infection, a sequel to a disc hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was once again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by his daughter Jade, to witness a school event, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The Chief of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on 26 November at the private international clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem making the trip, as I was operated twice on hernia disca, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he indicated that the singer had apparently "gone without a cannula, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed from a cerebral hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the justice system on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" demanded "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, it seems to me very risky, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former giscardist party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, on pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after reaching out to the left.
Moreover, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his management, he was assisted by Deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue an injunction to the Minister and the MP urging them to renounce the acronym and to transfer to them the rights of ownership of the trademark, on pain of lawsuit.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the UDF acronym, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it right to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in its militant material and on the homepage of its site, maintain the signatories of the letter.
As you already know, you have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office which demands that the NC withdraw "immediately the mention of the UDF's name from all support, as well as from (its) Internet site".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) mark to the legitimate beneficiaries".
If they do not do so, justice will be called upon to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "choose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Center does not, according to them, have any right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office charged with defending the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer a "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It takes advantage in a scandalous and fraudulent way of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to make it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC's strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make his own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one has no right."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday the Nanterre Court decided to bring to trial the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the weakness of the octogenarian to plunder part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment and 375,000 euros of fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga over one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are contested the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's heiress and principal shareholder always refused to undergo such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weak conditions and during what periods.
I think he'll accept.
“I will speak to her,” Ms. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, stated upon leaving the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The survey will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly woman, whom we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage for years of his mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the source of the action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' arguments resulted, on some occasions, in a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that his client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said he distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since his wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office once again considered that the applicant was not in a position to appear, all the more so since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to grant her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before the courts, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of the collaborators adhering to "values" determined from above as before was to impose on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the centre of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to the strategies of conquering markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R & D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "demands that all parties involved (...) have proactive behaviour and a forward-looking vision"; it needs a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we called for a management revolution, which would be to put the collaborators at the center of the company's concerns as well as the client.
Internal opinion polls have a relative usefulness
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, incite the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
- Second, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanistically.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behavioral theory that American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "commands" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management stance, maladapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies means adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make part of their dreams, ambitions and projects a reality.
Today, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of the motivations of employees.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring mobilisation factors, business managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resources management "in the place".
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo Speech: For the "Just War" Obama Receives Praise from the Right
This Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech Obama had delivered on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited the Obama award ceremony on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Mrs.Palin, a leading figure in the Republican party's right wing to the USA Today newspaper, and added that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
“The terrorists must be stopped,” he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former Speaker of the House was happy, who appreciated in particular the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider as a possible candidate for the Republican investiture for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current Washington Post chronicler, Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world", as "always does," he "spoke as an American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious, and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the President's left, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the centre-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama "pronounced the necessary speech," the New York Times said, judging it "at the same time as gloomy and uplifting."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the trade unions of the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement that puts an end to the slogan of strike and the threat that falls on the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "joyed" by the agreement, following several negotiation sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators said goodbye at Friday morning in the hope of quickly signing the text according to late morning.
Although three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by slamming the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours which began at 11 am was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 pm.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to companies" and "was feared that it would disturb the end of the year holidays," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there should be no further cuts or blockades in the supply centres.
But there may always be some dissenting rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects wage earners, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general meetings on road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable the issue of extraordinary pay and the modernization of the collective agreement to be dealt with in particular.
Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of 100 million euros in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment in the rectification finance bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "on the same terms."
TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply, first, to the companies affiliated to this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible," said Bussereau.
Opposition from employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR reported that it was a "naïve business", as the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in a situation of urgency, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who want to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, the Unostra lamented.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, unions disagree with RATP proposals
Conflicts in RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday's meeting, 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP management, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their demand for a premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday trains will only run between 10 am and 8 pm, at the rate of one train in every two on the central stretch (between La Defense and Nation) and one train in every four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "RATP is striving to provide service to large stores".
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP stretch runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in two trains circulated at peak hours, and almost no train at peak times, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on schedule".
Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operating SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or bound for Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfying" according to the unions, of a meeting held with the management on Friday afternoon will be analyzed.
The RER director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That's not what drivers who claim a premium due to them want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP even puts its proposals for a premium in parentheses, commented the CGT, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
Which also led the unions to say that the company "did not care about the weekend users."
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could extend to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Indépendants have given notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has a million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of bonuses, for schedules with alternating shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish party, a decision with grave consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just extended a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," Court president Hasim Kiliç told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to obtain dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the end of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550 seats).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that the deputies would leave Parliament before being MPs without party label.
The decision follows a procedure launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims that it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes as the government reaches out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures that strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders claimed that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the Southeast Anatolian, where a large number of demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the South-East populated mostly by Kurds.
Order forces threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters dropped Molotov bombs or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
Following the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was to "deepen discouragement."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
We are opposed to the closure of parties in principle.
So nothing is solved, declared the Minister of Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in Northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfalls can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is not at all something with which he wishes to make life impossible for the citizens, comments the director of maintenance of roads in winter of the FES
But with this their employees can learn to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
Weathermen may announce it for the first time on the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case the FES acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A stages with large vehicles with salt come out, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, major arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the accesses for the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and sections with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around 3:00 in the morning.
Approximately 1,040 kilometres should be covered, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That's why the FES starts around 3:00 in the morning, "with it the tracks are free until the rush hour traffic begins."
The hard part is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which also the Rat-Beil-Straße belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the trouble comes in, Brauburger tastes good.
Around five o'clock in the morning the FES infantry is launched, the dangerous points and cruisers are mainly cleared.
The FES would not normally be able to take over all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the vehicle with salt starts as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa encuenae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high running on the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa findae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we've found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, this is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a member of the Utah Museum of Natural History team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they collected in total the remains of five specimens.
One finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "The dinosaur fossils of the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn for example.
According to the current trend of opinion, dinosaurs first appeared approximately 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts discuss, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivoros (saurians with bird pelvis), to which they belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa findae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa’s skull, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those also owned by the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the theropod with the oldest and most primitive airbags, comments Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the posterior giant sauropods also possessed air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the earliest known dinosaurs so far lived in South America, researchers deduce that the saurians first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages separated at the beginning and spread from South America throughout all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a unique land mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa the remains of two other theropods not closely related.
The three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the science studio.
Naturally, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, comments Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line from reptiles to dominant Mesozoic terrestrial vertebrates remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of present-day crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Toward the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct at the limit of the Triassic towards the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a massive extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slowed the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved into the Triassic and since then led a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction from the occupied casino at Frankfurt Goethe University affected the world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, show solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police commando".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and diverted attention from the content.
The board of directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial complaint.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi trade union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, comments Verdi's national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the rector of the university and the police.
We're grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on an issue of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Province Parliament.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left) said.
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
As early as September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg science centre in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Narrow Collaboration Protocol" in Frankfurt.
The Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt he signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises from the natural science research centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the possibility to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist City of Planning" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, on which research facilities settled.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not placed at all high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, rather than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate to the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end in the middle of the city, were considered at that time fossils of engineering of the nineteenth century, which acted as brakes of a modern railway traffic, since formerly a huge amount of time was needed to hook the locomotives back forward.
Roll, stop dry to continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that's why the terminals must have disappeared in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is approximately half way along the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be initiated, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost unpayable to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course also have no more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's cart at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new stage built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have so arranged.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic's large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the computer-generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At the time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than truck transport on roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing in other crossings and narrow passages on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the Ministry of Transport ' s list.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 the route has been built at a slow pace.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the ruling on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in Wiesbaden's autonomous parliament, if it is to file an appeal against the Hesse administrative court's ruling on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts to investigate the VGH ruling, which is over 400 pages long, according to Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had substantiated in writing on this date that in the case of the planned construction of the north-west airstrip at Frankfurt airport, the Land would have to reregulate the nocturnal flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as foreseen by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, whether to file an appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal to the Nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It's quite difficult, if you're allowed to keep your word, said Green Boss Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federative government would be trying through misrepresentations of law and tricks still to get their night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite some time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first quick impression".
“We need a legally unblemished decision,” Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As the opposition represents, it would never have been their group's assertions about the ban on night air traffic.
U.S. banks repay the loans.
The big American banks shaken by the crisis are stripping themselves of their state bonds.
The Bank of America paid back at once the aid provided by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report from the United States CNBC.
With this the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had secured approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough means, including by selling items.
Bank Director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank house had miscalculated the effort of absorption of the investment bank at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also aims to raise money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported a source of known circles, which the US bank could announce by Thursday the increase of its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the Citi group did not wish to comment.
By June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Quick choice
In the end it all went faster than you thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative board of the ZDF (German television channel) pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night, the union wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, director of the main studio of the ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely the failure to harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter was also influenced, if this proposal would not be approved in the administrative council either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the administrative board with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union on the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated, they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by Hesse's president of the government, Mr.Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, that under the direction of Brender the ZDF news reports would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the election there were protests due to this, in which political influence on the ZDF was flagged.
In the end, 35 specialists in public law had been involved in the debate, who described Koch's course as unconstitutional.
But it didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked on the station "Südwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed for the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning programme "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional demand after the impeachment of Brender, who was elected even this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federated states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of politicians supporters of the ZDF control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's probable successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative council with a clever move: he strongly criticized the guild for the impeachment of Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the position to a partisan henchman.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is awarded anyway to left-wing liberals.
College careers clear.
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in undergraduate and master's cases.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each module of the career must end with a single examination.
It is also intended to examine the workload of students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination results between universities in and outside Germany.
The Länder undertake to make structural rules as a whole for Bachelor and Master careers more flexible.
Regulations of the Länder which differ from this must no longer exist.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have been continuously talking about the improvement of being able to successfully complete a career (studies).
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam", said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" the aim is to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in the future "studentability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to unnecessary restrictions on students' choice of..
courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative."
These rules would apply to new careers, but also to the examination of existing careers.
These must be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country-wide level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is set up by the Länder.
Ministers of Education and Culture urged the Länder in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some Länder, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Platinada has ensured that additional means are made available for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money the universities must implement programs of tutoring and student counseling, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The Land and the universities intend to have EUR 10 million available for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring a novel of university law to parliament.
According to her, a single examination should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
Career configuration should be made more flexible, and it is also intended to ensure the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitate accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all races about their "studies".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federated state.
Apart from the praises there were also criticisms about the decisions.
On the federal board of directors of the Juso (young socialist) university groups, it was demanded that the shaping of education policy should no longer be carried out " behind closed doors" of university ministers and rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, students as principals involved should now be able to express their views as well.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the students' experience," she said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the Bachelor degree the possibility of accessing a subsequent Master's degree.
In addition, the Länder have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there will be enough places in the future to study for Master with the best possible conditions of study.
The Länder have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education made no comments.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically uncontrolled," says the first line of a poem by lyrical Werner Söllner in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which he themes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a professor of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was given several literature awards, in 1993 he gave memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he talked a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian Secret Service Securitate in front of fellow German-ruman writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Prize.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly, in early 1971.
"I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against attempts to provoke the Securitate's fear," Söllner concluded.
The lyrical Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and her unrivalled literary polemic with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene is shaken, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that demonstrates the abysses and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only an author, but also a victim.
In his dossier of Securitate IM Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel following Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of the IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him on all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissenter and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the weekly "Zeit", after having read her own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and in some cases have known, what names were hiding behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and Walter as well.
Unlike the review of the Stasi dossiers with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of the control files by the Securitate is still quite diffuse.
Systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the handing over of the files since then is rather a drag.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of records.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the decorated.
"She has psychosis," in the end, she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown round and round in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, like so many times when there are silent faults.
Why just now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession leaves it to be hoped that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the cravings for knowledge and not so much by the allocation of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team's supplier, boarded a Class C Mercedes taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outside service member was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer would have distributed samples.
The man of the bald property had hired a chauffeur, because he did not yet know the city.
Otherwise, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55 - year - old man drunk with joy.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I'd start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the eighth of the finals", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 triumph against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league will have to be repeated in Mainz.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draw
The 8th Champions League finals (one-way matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return matches 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December at Nyon.
So the joy at the fulminant entry of Babbel's successor remained limited.
Not only in the supposed savior, who in a short time had inspired the bewildered profis of Stuttgart self-confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to concentrate on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that so simple sounds, but that with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a pause of several weeks due to an injury immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the perceived "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this was obviously what was missing when Babbel was there.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, players and the administrator also refrained from overestimating the triumph against a defense weakened by lack of relays and totally exceeded from Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0.4 had arrived the sad awakening, gave Khedira thought.
And management Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We haven't gotten over the problem yet.
That Heldt did not feel like celebrating on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions made by others, not Jens, faced Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in the direction of the board of directors, who had decided to change coaches because of pressure from teenage fanatics.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated he called it Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the zaguero.
They probably won't be friends forever anymore, the two of them.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the coach's team substituted, it would not have been possible to show great playing and battle force.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important participation in success," said Heldt and Lehmann in unison; and the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Fiery duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC partnership version beat American Kevin Johnson on Friday to Saturday night in Bern by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform the knockout that everyone had expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators at the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was avoiding again and again the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisively take his dangerous right hand to his target.
Generally speaking, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie", who "can't do anything".
When he weighed, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so that he could see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he beat then the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "his" belt from the WBC, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he later won in his defenses of the title to Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only received one blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles into his family.
His brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to British David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 metres tall.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the leader of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, a liar due to false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the most recent revelations about Kunduz's air strike, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), for knowingly cheating.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast on TV channel ARD, the leader of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report which NATO had, and which Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it had been reported that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air strike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the Afghan policy of the federal government, and whether the chancellery, the army and the information service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the green Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, decidedly rejected criticism.
The chancellery did not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry's presentation of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it became clear that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report by a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far it has not received an answer, it was said.
The ministry did not speak out on Saturday about the reproaches being made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Oneiric worlds
In a waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only the mentally ill and drug addicts are the boundaries between imagination and reality fading.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unfetteredly surrender ourselves to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleeplike states during the vigil, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often regarded in the modern Western world as mad or drug addicted, or at least as maniac.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drug addicts.
The fault is our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality to blur.
Oneirically modified alert states of consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of Hildegard von Bingen mysticism, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Charles Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often.
Gravity has no more power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived the hallucinations as a form of waking sleep, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the deviousness, crazy formations, and mirages of it".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is of two dimensions and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over him, it's floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red faces like blood, deformed, grinding their teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him into the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Shrieking and evil voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires out of the stereo, ties them to form a hanger knot, and fastens them on a hook on the roof.
He goes up on a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope is loose.
Let it be a lesson to you!, the voices shout in a chorus that bursts his eardrums, "Go to the clinic and have them heal you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, in addition it is manic-depressive, taking medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he has been married.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outer and inner worlds, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, relationship disorders, or persecution mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish how important it is from what it is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning aimed at him.
At the same time, he takes on a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remain in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For the researchers still an unknown why our brain makes cabriolas.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality on an interim basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain's neural maturity is affected in an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it is still unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a previous disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain's transmitting system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive medicines to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor Erich Kasten of Psychology of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has collected reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as personality boundary disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and head injury .
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or poorly inhibited; when our brain warms up, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other states of brain exception.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, lived in a small town of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attended a high school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren't for those images and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, a clumsy boy with long dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she goes and hears that guy, just like she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can feel even his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he sometimes cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he visibly and audibly explains the mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While she waits in the dark room for the dream, which often comes late and is scarce, she cannot tell whether she is awake or dreaming, whether the images she sees, the faces or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
She hasn't told her parents and friends anything, they'd think she was crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
Hallucinations have been gone for a year.
Ever since she's been in Internet contact with psychologist Kasten, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffering from a stimulus restriction, he or she is likely to start hallucinating after a while.
I think the brain is vacated and he takes care of it for entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was in little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he has used reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, affected people like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
The boundary situation between sleep and hallucination
In this world too conscious, imaginary experiences tend to be pathologicalized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as being a dream.
Oneiric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later cannot differentiate from being awake.
Oneiric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis being fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a world of its own and imaginary that is disconnected from reality.
A form of situation bordering on sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change of world, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an inexhaustible situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several-day journeys after an operation of heart valves with heart transplant included, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he saw himself prostrate in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching over his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with top snow and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these interior trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, thus describing your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "may lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
Children will take care of the publishing house at age 27
The new publisher Kallen has come to an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they're capable of it.
One cannot put their children in front of 7,500 workers, if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would put an end to the children and the company as well.
Burda announced Thursday that he will retire from January from the chair of the board of directors and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for the technology.
Later, he took over the treasury and with it came responsibility for the company’s assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the top of the editorial.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves, "to bridge the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from decay: "This has always affected families who let themselves be infected by the pursuit of capital, who have misjudged and thought that they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had delusions of grandeur, Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
All that -in matter of beauty and well-being - you can wish for, within reach of your hand.
This is what seems to have been proposed El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the Callao shopping center (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and pampering of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -who is in charge of laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, who owns a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where teapot stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to put on your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and having a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxion.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
It all starts by inserting your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And if, after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Varying necklines
Christmas is coming and it is never too much to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party costumes.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
There's a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The Endesa electric company, together with Barcelona City Council, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the implementation of the electric car in the city and achieve agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electrical Cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electricity company has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and energy efficiency in particular.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has active a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automobile industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector in the country.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has put in place throughout the year to support the automobile sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of closing some of our main production plants," the president of the government said.
"Thanks to this plan and to the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" of registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and motorists.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will classic motorcycles and cars be found, but ClassicAuto Madrid will find all kinds of items related to the motor world.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the classic engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restaurant; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and restoration; or Cochera Clásicos, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Tests of ability on the outside
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be complemented by parallel activities: holding rallies, sporting exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on a circuit enabled outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system -baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved throughout its whole.
The finishes, the completion of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting at the driving position, we see that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
Likewise, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the box instrument box and console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and flashy colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the one also presented by the Honda Civic.
We can therefore say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this Japanese compact features more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk and with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre, 150-horsepower petrol engine and with the six-speed manual change.
This engine is an authentic delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its reduced rumoriness, for the performances and for achieving contained consumptions.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 will be diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers per year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high running comfort, and for its contained consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is to say the one that incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
From the standard equipment stands out especially the lane change assistant (RVM) which eliminates the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy tires.
In addition, just as little as its equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: Bixenon adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 150 horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
The only inconvenient of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the version tested -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us large doses of satisfaction every day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality from the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexy' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark lady.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, with no possibility of even seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, really, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has released two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price of around 12 euros per month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with smartphones already know what it's like to give up data when you cross the border or desperately look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and would long have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a Ph.D. in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
Repeated European Commission ear jerks to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have hardly had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a little thing like FonPeek (it's still curious that it bears the name Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this kind of fare means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including download traffic for books and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It's a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that's what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifetime access option like the one Peek already has in the US.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my e-mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the preferred tone of the American First Lady.
If he has already come to the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, he has chosen the same one to accompany him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -green yellow with bright reflections-, the two times the outfit was made up of three pieces - clad, jacket and coat of the same fabric-, and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat Vestaurio.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with print.
The accessories have also varied: green mid-heel shoes last time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a picked up on this occasion, mane looses the previous one.
Seventy-five per cent of working mothers have had problems working because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and career history of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey conducted between 9,737 women aged 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about it: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of partnering and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, first start living together, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting their cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their life path to obtain them, which has led them to postpone the union and arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts much influence on motherhood, although less on the timing of the pairing," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and when they have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age at which they marry and the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at the average age of 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"Another division is also established among women according to their level of education.
While those who have elementary education marry and have their first child before getting a stable job, those at middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado explains.
Diane Kruger's worth it, too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to her envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, singing the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous signings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetic brand also features luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony, held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Póquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) some thirty X-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical appearance, life and work), but looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the creative character.
The journey has its excitements and Vincent does not save scares or illuminations.
In addition to exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
I'll leave you some snapshots here.
About Albert Camus: "In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, impulse, the same one I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against pitiful fate, guiltless morality and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, meaningless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he conjure the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which has to be climbed by the north wall, from which the best climbers take off again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
From himself, he sometimes said that he was heir to a county landlord and sometimes that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane cry thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to bring his echo to the bottom of the 20th century night under his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got down on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were recorded these verses by Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after life satisfied the death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband accepted in all normality that she told him that Edward VII spied on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to get Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct the fame of that man to serve him as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly assault
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed by her and our dog, a mixed race specimen, rescued from the kennel and weighing no more than six kilos and, without a word, they gave her two kicks that left the dog badly injured.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find the fun in a free assault on a small, defenseless animal, which, by the way, was tied up.
To this must be added the hot flash that provoked a lady who walked calmly and that, when she rebuked these individuals, she came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energetic who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elder or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt would do much good and not generate suspicions, just to clarify that the murderous cowards were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to mistreat for free a defenceless animal that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for wearing the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among the youngest motorists, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and said that he also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main aims is to develop increasingly safe products.
Turn up the sale of light commercials
Nearly two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to the employer's figures of the Anfac manufacturers and the Ganvam sellers.
The good data, however, should be quarantined, since the reference to which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the upturn in the last month, enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% lower than in the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold together with all the vehicles that make up the tailor drawer of light commercials: derived from passenger cars, pick ups, vans, light vans and light trucks/chasis.
Clouds that most affect their demand have not also disappeared, since although they are also purchased by private individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100 per cent of cases through external financing.
Thus, other factors such as rising unemployment levels or continuing poor economic conditions must be added to the restrictions imposed by the closed tap of bank loans.
In view of this scenario and unlike passenger cars, aid to the purchase of 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, they can benefit from them, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, from Ganvam, they again recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrialists (trucks and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As was the case with ABS anti-lock brakes and it will pass with ESP stability control, emergency braking support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already registered in all new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of deficiency is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase pedestrian protection although, because of its way of working, it can also help avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency braking assistant does increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's stomping.
But this one doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not reached the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system becomes popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps you increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If you do not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably the 8th - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points of the plan has previously been agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document to be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where factories exist, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next few days.
To this it is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, who is backed by the Russian group Converg, gains strength.
Should there be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets from Saab to Baic China.
The decision to close Saab by the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, in the first place, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of the canvas with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'falls' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they earned 7 kilos more; riding sports basketballs another 12 and with the light wheels of 19 inches, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and swapping the door handles for some fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the double clutch PDK switch, the test was performed on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly by California secondary roads, on mountain stretches with really revamped layouts
Their behavior can only be described as unblemished.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not step on the asphalt with lead.
Rather, quite the opposite: it has been a while since we tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, it transmits so much safety in the curve passage, even at high speeds.
He's a small athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short run for as long as necessary, until we order him to sprinte, to brake, to recover and re-squeeze his engine...
What we ask of you. Thanks to your address, as communicative as precise, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine's roar, previously released in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from the ground up or in recoveries.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads that we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite grounded, but the car digested well the bumps.
The electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that which in one of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, already well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put up for sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate of Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer lavishes her malota face with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia Gives Himself a Victory in Israel · Global Voices
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant victory for 82-91 in its visit to the complicated court of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous casualties that Dusko Ivanovic's team had, and in this way it is placed in the lead of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 valuation).
The Vitorian team was able to fill in the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer to the end to take the victory.
In addition, the great hit from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had much to do with the final triumph.
The match began face-to-face for the bluegranes, who were put from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Vitorians were from the perimeter already foreshadowing that they had jumped to the Israeli court with hot wrists..
English and Teletovic were the main creators of the 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with whistles and applause on his return home, to continue expanding his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'less six' of valuation already presage that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the party, despite being on the road to rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians that on their court no one wins, and with 'Elías' hand pressing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellows' turning the light (50-49).
More downsides
Ivanovic's, wounded but no less dead, needed to spun a couple of successful moves to catch air, and on those came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring rent (54-67), which managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaveses left to leave their skins in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign themselves and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match already had owner and the victory was escaping Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injuries prevent the Unicaja from being battled
The Unicaja lost shockingly in Greece to the Olympiacos and gave him the lead of Euroliga group B, in a match marked by the losses of the cashiers, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship and also by the entity of the rival, perhaps of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, at which point an action, conato de fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function showing their superiority within both areas, where the English pivot injury Joel Freeland and Carlos Jimenez's three personal faults were hurting the cashiers.
Between the indoor players and the Lithuanian eave Linas Kleizas, with their triples, they increased the lead 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible retracement
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, was superior and even even equalled the difference of the contest at Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which tottered the group's lead.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last discharge of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all the drawbacks the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when they pressed and given their superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to climb back to basket average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went out, handing over the lead to the Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application by Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application has been in operation, the search engine has found that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly remunerated", explained in a statement the head of product of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from his search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 gross euros per year and a French programmer, 31,059, compared to 24,000 for a Spanish programmer.
Similarly, a driver charges €34,247 net annually in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by dependent, with 14,725 euros; and operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the net in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker jobs.
Brazil puts date to the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president should leave the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, when his term of office would officially end.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, told TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy before that date, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term of office, he has to seek another destiny."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said via telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which he was elected Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya said he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by the rejection of Zelaya's political asylum status, which was intended to be imposed on him by the "de facto" government presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in markets, uncertainty reappears again in markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing a liquidity-free bar at close to zero rates for financial institutions to buy off assets.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have almost ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand in the gears like the ECB did with its auction a year later next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reductions.
Stock Exchange volatility and corporate bond differentials have rebounded again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the spreads of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened a further downward review of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go wrong to silence the moral hazard advocates who were again trying to create a position of conscience on those responsible for global economic policy because they have curbed the destructive effects of credit restrictions on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving day.
However, the Dubai thing paints a tribal struggle between the Emirs to recompose power in the Emirates and the Greek thing we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are facing an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt differentials expand like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review up their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, they return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur much life expectancy for their warning.
Again, it looks all the way that it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "prudence, driver friend".

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain is debated these days in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushstrokes of what he had raised in the subcommission behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros until 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants are still open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be directed towards increasing capacity in generation, but rather in distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue changes and the power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that it takes 18,000 MW new, of course, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Bill just passed by the government is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to make blood out of the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "points" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken as soon as they mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus' 'handling' at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for the airport services on the ground, Swiss Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for the services of cargo at ten European airports where it has presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, of which economic terms have not been extended, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Innovation Center for Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance contemplates an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to investigate energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona contests its first motorway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
She is fighting for her first concession highway in Australia, a market where she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are their rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the nearest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a highway builder and dealer.
City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to take the project forward, in a business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
Pending the submission of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to AUS$1.7 billion (1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortia with a notable presence of European construction companies compete.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in Liza, and his companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European underground construction specialists.
The Northern Direct consortium plays against the Acciona team, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large works and privatisations, but there is a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionaire assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the business of desalination.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of raising and managing Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate those two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and named Northern Link (north link), is called to link the western Toowong motorway with the ring road at Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel. It is the greatest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The schedule set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute A$500 million (€308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who reported yesterday obtaining a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will provide rapid internet access to 400,000 people and will give work to the German woman for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. Works were still to be started and Hochtief has closed the sale by 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC awards a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a Slovenian motorway worth EUR 64.5 million.
The firm gets this contract days after taking over the works to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) by 130 million.
Alpine thus reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will be completed for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awarded Renfe's publicity
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract includes the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Mrs. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that submitted to the contest called by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fine of 63 million for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company accumulates more than €560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing their competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed the wake of other operators and has opened an application shop on the Internet, with the aim of increasing the revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange App Store will be active in France and UK.
We will have to wait for 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club that have won the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the major revenue sources of the major clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have come out well from this cast.
The white club has been the third on the continent that has bagged the most money for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the reigning champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, more money billed for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four in Italy, the three in England and the two in Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each match they contest.
There are also bonuses to be won (800,000 euros) and to be tied (400,000 for each team).The eighthfinalists will receive three million each; the eight fourthfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four million will be bagged each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337,8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main ones, and has four places assigned.
The champion of the previous year gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday revealed the details of the stock purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public takeover bid (opa) for all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be remunerated with an interest for that postponement of 1% per year
Yesterday Sos's shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, New Rumasa's offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos's real valuation.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV claimed not to have been informed of the offer, even though the company of the Ruiz Mateos claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If made, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his address.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and the judicial turmoil of his former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, he announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created post that will report directly to the group chairman.
And it is not without controversy, as the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to companies of the Salazars.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will reveal new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National High Court that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
CNMV authorizes the opt-out of Paternina presented by Investora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized the opt-out opa presented by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this transaction by understanding that its terms comply with the rules in force and by considering the content of the explanatory prospectus submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December last to be "enough".
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been frozen, which may not be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the regulations in force.
New tools for perpetrating cars
In these days of weather and accidents, not only do car shops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a crash are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No claims are equal, and the calculation of part costs and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Calculate manually the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and handpieces, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That's why almost 100% of experts use these types of systems.
Service providers and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are engaged in collecting information from manufacturers and then developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of assessment and information processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, to the extent that more versions, variants and drives have been released in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as a new car goes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very difficult task, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle has to be catalogued and its price introduced.
In addition, of each model a "smart" graphic image is made where different parts of tourism can be "punched".
If it is a large scale model, the job may be ready in a week if the process goes too fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of the databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for handling scrapping parts or for calculating the venous or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard casualty assessment solution, intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint scales.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of expert reviews, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass concentrates on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows to bid for the vehicles declared total accident.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analyses or know the deviations by brands or models.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of these types of tools.
It commercializes, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is an Einsa Group company founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for assessing damage, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Guide to Valuations is its historical benchmark product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and in 2008 it billed €10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
For his part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and in 1979 he settled in Spain.
According to company sources 62% of their business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The world turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informax ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will earn 19,1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the Stock Exchange, and now its shares are listed for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark.
Internet Auction of Accidented Cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The operation involved a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rent companies, workshops, scrap shops and professional sellers who must register before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily advertisements are managed and about 100 new advertisements are included in the Spanish market each day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been revoked cannot be recirculated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even if they have been decommissioned after some tedious steps.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Workshop tool, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the replacement, create a budget and generate a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are often more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with internet connection is required to use it.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified using its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaWorker is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inside face.
