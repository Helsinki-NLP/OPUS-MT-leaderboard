Populist Right Triumph in Austria, together make up 29%
Early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, a appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of votes, so it loses 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still is the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two major Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the popular ones who called these early elections.
Still in early July, when the OVP came out of the coalition, the popular had in terms of preference over the SPO, a considerable advantage.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party president and, until today, vice-chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved by Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both populist right-wing parties - the Liberals (FPOs) have won approximately 18 percent and the BZO, 11 percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would happen in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it dismembered BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction by the European Union.
For this evolution Haider clearly bets who already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and is therefore not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can cool
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles is not solved, a cooling of Czech-Indian relations could be achieved, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this were not resolved then yes, then this cooling would certainly be achieved," he noted after the meeting that was organized on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get involved.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempted from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest authorities.
He can then request the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises to appeal to the High Court and then pardon would be possible," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted person a "legal competent support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already obtained by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize him," Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, to her colleague she insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it wrong to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister evaded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would take care of the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises," he just checked.
A Czech arbitrates a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, depicting Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small lost spot in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its chief, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
Rule this mood and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed hides to this day a world little known, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms until today that themselves carry the key to the development of anticancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the mainland.
The countries with coasts have today begun to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty these take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is essentially the so-called continental border which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental border.
"Simply speaking, the continental border means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the limit of the sea coast, and often to the border of 200 nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Border Continent, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist support commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have been successful," added Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine domain.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the seabed area that was awarded by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e. almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains in their study.
The profit to be derived from the use of the seabed will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
The region of the ocean floor declared by Treaty as "common heritage of humanity" begins at the end of the continental border.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is no gold mine," says director Mikulka emphatically adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed belongs also to the Czech Republic.
It is divided with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors as well as other few states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is bumpy, it's something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the German special forces command was at the place of action
To resolve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the ministry of defense and the ministry of the interior in the action of salvation the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore at the place of liberation were specialists of the German army as well as GSG 9 officers, flight squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity institution.
As ministry spokesmen reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany's help to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately that time did not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt the assailants had kidnapped a group of travellers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian as well as her 8 Egyptian companions.
After the abduction of the hostages in the southern desert region of Egypt, they were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown to the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the saved and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages released were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He didn't say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve of the Salvation Package
The first House of Congress of the United States let a large $700 billion salvation package for the financial markets fail.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes to 206 the government's package for saving financial markets.
Despite all calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties he did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked MPs to vote although the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was the concerns of investors that the state salvation package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, fell again.
The experts have other serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
In order to allow the current program to enter, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel reservations for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened situation, the Germans' desire to travel remains as before.
As the German travel association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel reservations for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more in comparison to the same period last year.
According to research by the research institute of the GfK markets, reserves for the fall months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost 11 percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are figures from GfK which are the information analyzed on reservations at 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar, especially travel to the United States is in great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost one third.
Germany's preferred destinations are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece, but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized travel is very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel costs are "better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so the volume of sales compared to last year rose again - although according to one other study the number of Germans making a trip, comparing last year, dropped.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Spa, the beer in one liter jars and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A tent debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian costume to measure.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: as soon as we're in the tent, the photographers already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very flattering especially because I'm first at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in a traditional Bavarian outfit to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at Teresa's Prado everything is no big deal.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian suits or leather pants; none seems to be heed or feel unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A muniquesa draws my attention to my apron that was dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, the half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is widow."
Or God, now I'm buckled from behind to the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others do not worry about many subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it is written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their knotted ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is named Bob, is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
To him he looks like "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after he put next to his glass of a liter of beer he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire hydrant, most people think that's a garbage can.
So Bob's one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
Around eight o'clock at night, the restroom groups run around the party and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear each time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered walks of one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They arrive sober, they return drunk.
You can't see who's suffering from the degrees of alcoholemia and who's in the way.
"They're the ones who "can't do more," a health care provider answered my question and disappeared in tumult.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road, in the town of Brentwood, was implicated in the accident that occurred at Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers nested the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set at the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, looking like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in your complex is a bit decadent.
But once the box office is over vaulted, there is no doubt about what was the company's greatness that this was the westernmost gate.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that was curated to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under
British rule and when forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then the station has declined and remained out of history.
But today, this railway, gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new partnership policy.
The Turkish Government has excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed into a bunk bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolt trip, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived at the Turkish capital - new city, designed to govern a new secular state, away from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigmatic change in the Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and, especially, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and "power pastry shops" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet first thing in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and West at the same time.
It's not a case if it's not to one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "Turkey could be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replies, "does not want to affront that choice."
He then underlines one point that almost everyone I spoke to so far had recited to me almost by heart: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again to Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would, to a large extent, be in Turkey's hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So there is not much doubt as to what continent this fascinating country must claim to be.
Lives of Remembering: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (eschela, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under-21s, but at the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were finishing 20 - let's just refuse to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer of forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or Messiaen, indifferently if not accompanied or with complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So you just have to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxed, nor too flowery.
Whatever musical shearing, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, by any, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of grandeur and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two well-known war horses around the world."
We'll miss you very much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) you claim that "in 1946 he resumed economic history studies at Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, master's degree and doctorate."
This is learned in a note from Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which season he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention because of their simplicity and the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with a lot of respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second round for Honda's bestsellers
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
Added to this are refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
That's the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation into the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than that employed by other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is less well known in Europe, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during 2008.
It is precisely in Japan that nearly a million Jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda hopes that this new Jazz will increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm commercialized a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a growth of 17% in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also hopes to achieve 2% by 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters in length - from which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, once its presentation in partnership takes place in January in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz grows at all its heights.
Its length rises to 3.90 meters (five centimetres more), the width to 1.69 meters (two centimetres more) and the wheelbase to 2.50 meters, an increase of five centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1,52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - rises to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measurements are of the version with the 1.4 engine, since the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear squares.
And the doors that give access to the second row present an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also new are the engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two petrol propellants of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre mechanics achieve a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 laps.
This propellant - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has an expense of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Regarding the previous propellant, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, it now becomes 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Brand Management Technology and Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan's four-area Safety Shield.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capacity of the vehicles of the brand.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles Nissan's Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is the bee's compound eyes, able to see with an angle of over 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor which immediately results in the prevention of collision.
"The moment you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate a bee's movements and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right or higher angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and principal engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can function continuously with just a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we're not talking about memory gigs, not even megas."
This is the first step in developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced into standard cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles along the way.
Tremble before mortgage
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid to make injections, is not lacking in wit.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created a fun and informative browser game: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the 'Hotel of Bad Credits'... or the troubles.
The grim aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think once, twice and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
True, he has useful information, but little detail.
It's more of a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What if the game is completed?
Well, there's a dream room in the hotel.
Something's something, because we don't even talk about buying a better house...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, to pay nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock exchange listing.
A week after having discovered an interim deal, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars with the purchase of convertible securities which will ensure a return of 10% and a conversion price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global transaction would be carried out on the basis of a unit price of $29, or 28% above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley action however lost 6.79 percent to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," explained Juan Mack, the director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for nearly $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, "we thought the participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current state of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7 % below its book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20 % of the benefit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares within one year if they are sold at more than 50 % above the conversion price, or about $47 over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital contributed by MUFG will allow him to take investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group refused, however, to elaborate on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had greatly relieved his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its stock exchange price drop by half while the cost of security against a risk of flaws on its debt took off.
This cost fell back last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced having raised $15 billion, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, he is the third to vote on a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results referring to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and a recount by a non-governmental organisation had announced a broad victory for the "yes", estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday to Monday night.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in the State ' s power over the economy, reserving for it the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to foreign exchange sent by their émigrés.
Carried by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants reinforced powers to the head of State, who will be able to make up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and intend a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the interdiction of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
All 19 abducted persons have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released Monday afternoon.
By morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good upon arrival at 15H30 aboard a special aircraft to the Al Maza military base adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana declared at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown hijackers while enjoying a safari on SUVs in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since passed from one pike to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian- and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of fire took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said this responsible who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lighting" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said without going into details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
On the eve, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an SUV aboard which the kidnappers were present, of which six were killed, including the Chadian chief and two were arrested.
He also claimed that they were related to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan-Unit Liberation Movement (SLA-U), an allegation immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate about the financing of the fait les manchettes culture and occupies the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But one sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or to national historical places starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we not have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of Chinon Castle alone in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy care to search history, save with little money lots of private archives and preserve archaeological vestiges.
These are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible throw their bulldozers at our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
By when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands states - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in distress due to the effect of the mortgage crisis on the US market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros this financial and insurance institution that also has businesses in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at the highest level with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's head of economic competition.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the crisis in the Euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves more than a year ago, so the decisions taken with regard to the Bank can in a sense be regarded as precedents.
According to the decision taken in the early morning of Sunday, the three states will buy approximately half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell part of its business, including mainly the activities - mainly insurance- purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis actions began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However analysts agree to point out that with its 85 thousand employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break.
The company's shares only on Friday declined by 12 percent, with this being the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares decreased by more than two thirds.
Observing the current prices of the shares, the total value of the group's capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The management of the Bank imputed the abrupt fall of Fortis shares to the insecurities of the US market in relation to the approval of the US 700 billion dollar package plan.
On Monday the shares already showed a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the bank's new general manager.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors had nothing to worry about, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank's clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
The Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when viewing the drug purchase data.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which joins the use of the data of the recipes in all cases to the approval of the given person.
It must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the fox henhouse" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and compensation amount dependent on the customer's health condition and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply don't make the contract.
Before they sent the client to medical check-up and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the check-up.
Dick ten years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: with the customer's identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the client's illnesses and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of pills to lower cholesterol, it indicates that the level of fat in your blood is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration hardly has anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and for heat waves and even antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the former are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, request the patient's approval.
The authorities already force them to do this, although they were not fined for the negligence of so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and, by linking them with drug use data, obtain more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and health service providers.
The bill that gives the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is now before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another issue that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So hens, in spite of everything, are exposed to the fox's goodwill.
Marseille Global Menu
European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually trading partners, this issue, in addition to the other largely global problems, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A French-Indian summit will also be held today to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs but member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator as to whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not addressed at the ninth summit which began yesterday in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Office, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, the main representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase their trade to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
They have thus legally harmonised the 26 existing bilateral civil aviation conventions with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also called for, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will hold on to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20%.
India also agrees with this, as next year's climate conference should reach a global agreement and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
They also wished to hinder the increase in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers to the international exhibition of the book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book expects for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles in exhibition and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government in the ceremony of inauguration of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
There will be an encounter with the printing at the Struktur Room in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing houses in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors decreases progressively over the total of Italian production, and in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the missing millionaire a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The debris has been found on a highlands at 3000 meters altitude, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, in the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wood County Commissioner John Anderson has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have the confirmation that it is that which Steve Fossett was flying over on the day of his disappearance" he said at a print conference.
The Commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
The 63-year-old millionaire was given up for death in February.
The American office for transport safety (Ntsb) has made it known that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squadron of researchers has been sent that has identified the apparatus: it is typical of Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the end of Nevada, some of Fossett's personal remains have been found by a couple near his Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
By 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the turn of the world into a hot air balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the turn of the world by plane and without stopovers.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters in height, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv outside the schematics with an original and well-established design with defined lines and defined angles.
It is this, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Owned by the content out of the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available in the exhibition rooms Mercedes-Benz since next October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that would dominate the central street of Milan's shopping mall, Avenida Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
Without a doubt Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of car communication.
Will this formula be able to capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is at stake.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following for years the Italian National and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fans either.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these Sofia have been added a small group (a few units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have flags of three colors where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fanatics.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of the Levski.
The Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among what had gone out for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to frequent a stadium.
Four Italian fanatics, who had a history of stadium crime, have been refused the ticket and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fanatics who have been arrested or who have been identified in the messes.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Luckily!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others may be added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say of the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why "good eyes open" especially in view of Wednesday's National Party in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia bras.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams which can also have a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"Duce-Duce choirs and arm raised during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria non is a reato ...".
This is the thought (in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that was formerly of Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste's head of public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not true to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics that has been shameful.
"I don't do the sociologist – adds the Observatory's n.1 – the challenges are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles on Mameli's anthem: those too are not a feat, but if you allow them they are not educational either..."
