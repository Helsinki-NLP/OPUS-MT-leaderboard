Accumulated incidence of rapid increase in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing in all countries.
Based on experience in Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve their preparedness for a wave of patients with COVID-19 who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent was a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2.
Since then, disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and that most people recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those of Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries with that in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were recorded in France on 24 January 2020, in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA and UK (UK) countries, with 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date inclusive, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), reports of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of truncated COVID-19 at 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day truncated COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries generally followed that of Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries exhibited similar upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries, compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
He noted that, as of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA and UK countries had already recorded a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the different stages in which countries are found, variations in national public health responses and possibly different country case definitions and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data are not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive and intermediate care every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios in relation to saturation of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk >90 % of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since clusters of cases have so far been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional target population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as that occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if it is not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in the deaths of 3,000 people and has infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere around the world, leading to a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Feast of 25 January 2020 has become an unheard of and indelible memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; so, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country and to nearly 50 more countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3000 patients deceased.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19, including their virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, have been published since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the progress made in research on this new subject, which is rapidly developing.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some critical questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China, in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third per coronavirus recorded in the history of mankind.
As shown in fig. fig. 1.1, conglomerates of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that transmission between humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transportation was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the source of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and nearly 50 more countries around the world (fig. (fig. 2).
As the situation is evolving rapidly, the final size and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half (47.7 per cent) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 and only 14 infected persons were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men more (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 expanded into conglomerates mostly in and around Hubei.
On average, 5 days (from 2 to 9) elapsed between the onset and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Party in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, wrapped viruses that contain a single-way chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses are those that infect humans.
The ear glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its cell receptors, the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The genome of viral RNA is released to the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA, along with the glycoproteins of the envelope and the proteins of the nucleocapside, forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: Wuhan's Huanan seafood market.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With an electron transmission microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultrathin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motive.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the full-length electronic cryomicroscopy structure of human ACE2 in resolution 2.9 Å, in complex with the B0AT1 transporter amino acid.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats and were transmitted to humans by civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the bat was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and the route of transmission remains elucidated.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of bat virus to humans, implying homologous recombination within protein S.
According to one study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long snout mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% propagated by the totality of two genomes remains a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 % ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
So far, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Consequently, we can only resort to previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4).4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophagic phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response adds to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Cooperating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T-cell functions by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Mood immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system locally generates a large amount of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases, multi-organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by appearance in conglomerates, most likely affects older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large amount of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adapt effective quarantine time to the most accurate incubation period; this will prevent asymptomatic infected people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or by other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnoea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
In a comparable way, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the greater lethality of SRM with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with SRM.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100 %), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25 %) and sore throat (13%-25 %) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory care was needed in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high and rose to 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 95 % from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
It is therefore much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruiser.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital can re-enter the virus, an alarm signal that quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at an early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocytic sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer level, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities are detected in the chest X-rays of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadows or opacity in bilateral frosted glass in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (APRS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid build-up and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gaseous exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases surfactant level and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst findings in thoracic x-rays are often in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of a hyalin membrane and lymphocyte infiltration into the interstice, and multinucleated syncycial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral infection and of the RASD, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
A combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is therefore essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of use of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a graduated rod in less than an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can mostly provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from patients recovered for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as those of the digestive system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Consequently, respiratory assistance is critical to alleviating symptoms and saving lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assistance (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storm is known to be the result of an exaggerated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release an enormous amount of free radicals that are the main cause of RASD and multiorgan failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 monoclonal antireceptor antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of T-cell-directed immune response; blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a cytokine signaling pathway 4 suppressor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses were not beneficial for severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which affects the prognosis noticeably.
However, the prudent use of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids has been recommended for a short period of time for patients with critical COVID-19.
At the date of this analysis, the efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19, has been proven.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other viruses with monocatenary RNA, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of patients recovered and antibody generation
The removal of blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting the disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
On this basis, plasma was removed from the blood from a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and 10 seriously ill patients were injected.
His symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and a better saturation of oxygen in the blood.
However, this needs to be verified and clarified to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overly stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, possibly leading to fatal toxicity.
Blood antibody levels are usually low, and plasma demand is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to MCT theories.
Most effective components remain unknown or imprecise, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China who used CTM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used CTM in only about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western medicine (MO) only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time needed to recover body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were noticeably shorter in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
More strikingly, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was noticeably lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still waiting for more well-controlled trials on larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and to determine the effective components of CTM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are generally very afraid of highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbiditys were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more nervous and guilty of the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma on their family and friends.
Mental health care should therefore be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspected persons and persons in contact with them, as well as to the general public who needs it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein S-based vaccines to generate potent, long-lasting neutralising antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated virus vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older people and models of lethal stimulation and their protection against infection by zoonotic viruses still need to be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because SARS was extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been recorded since then.
However, there are still sporadic cases and conglomerates of MERS in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 years and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 years old in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably greater than those who did not (mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and Complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care most likely suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to also bind to positive ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the patient's evolution.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they constitute traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunctions.
Main clinical symptoms: Chest X-ray and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with the other symptoms for the prediction of clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period of time in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as described above, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as in general, they endured long quarantine periods and extreme uncertainty, and attended the deaths of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild symptoms or does not cause symptoms in the early phase of infection, as with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients at an early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while transmission mostly did not occur at the early stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have caused significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have ended by March and the descending phase will last for 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a flu-like cyclic episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, control of the disease has been achieved.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually become extinct or a less pathogenic virus than coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (fig. (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the faeces, which raises a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by infections in nosocomiums, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passers-by in contact with infected patients or persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with respirator N95 (serial number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the droplets of fluid from a potentially infected person from being transmitted through the air or attached to surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can fully penetrate them; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, health care providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear custom isolation robes to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected himself with SARS-CoV-2 despite having worn an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his swollen eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear protective masks or clear glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered a suitable distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused great alert in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and containing the disease.
This message significantly relaxed the public's alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment was wasted to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious in making public announcements, as every word matters to citizens and can cause them to change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic at its early stage, rather than attempting to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in implementing adapted and effective simulations to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and test and improve society's response system periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the sense of re-emergence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older persons than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which creates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients may be positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronaviruses of bats similar to SARS, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the original host virus, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to stop the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can reemerge at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically while it is transmitted between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it become extinct like SARS, or will it periodically reemerge like the flu?
While it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many other questions.
However, no matter what it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven co-evolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild diseases, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the currency by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put coronaviruses in the spotlight again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most coronaviruses of humans have their origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigating coronavirus-host interactions in animals could also shed important information on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven coronaviruses of humans, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and the transmission between species.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different coronaviruses of humans from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
The coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of monocatenary virus positive monocatenary with envelope.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, 26 to 32 kilobases, among the RNA viruses, were called "coronaviruses" due to their morphology, because of the crown shape they have under an electron microscope.
As for its structure, coronaviruses have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including ear protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different coronavirus lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the betacoronavirus genus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes for most alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five beta-coronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (APRS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from nasal secretion in patients with common colds in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through in-depth studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude lethality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) led to a persistent epidemic in the Arabian peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later called SARS-CoV-2, is the agent causing the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven coronaviruses of humans have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and not pathogens, but present great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force, and limiting factors of jump between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the intermediate animal reservoir and hosts and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for the prevention of future spread.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that parent viruses of human coronaviruses are usually not pathogens in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also examine the trend of evolution of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility often leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analysed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal discharge of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in various infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discoveries of human coronaviruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, such as headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and the subsequent serial passage into lactating mouse brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed around the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a period of disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in the history of mankind, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from superpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the onset of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and shortness of breath as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and elevated level of creatine kinase are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30 % of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, liver, and kidney, can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-pit lung biopsy of a relative of the initial patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to the investigation of human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined to be prevalent in young children, older adults, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Coriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although there were accidents due to unknown causes, as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these coronaviruses of humans acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenous.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although the majority of laboratory confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, there have been cases imported with occasional contagion to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of SRM are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which so far occurs only with MERS among diseases caused by human coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed laboratory cases were recorded, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making the MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known to be.
From mid to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 an international public health emergency and, in addition, called COVID-19 disease.
As of 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a raw lethality of 3.4%.
Notably, the lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which occurs as fever, cough and dyspnoea.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases have been reported of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2, which could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has features that are most commonly seen in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including the occurrence of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronavirus acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passes between humans, as with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with the other coronaviruses of humans, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still be elucidated in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with human coronavirus acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after passes between humans, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Coronaviruses have been eliminated from humans that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that developed severe coronavirus diseases in humans.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people infect, the greater the likelihood that it will fully adapt to humans.
If properly adapted, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as the coronavirus of humans acquired in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogen than human coronaviruses acquired in the community and less pathogen than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary hosts, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and human coronavirus amplifiers.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it houses a closely related ancestor who shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is normally well adapted and is not pathogen in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host houses a coronavirus of humans on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, guests become naturally infected and are the natural hosts of human coronaviruses or their parent viruses.
On the other hand, if human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogen.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and fulfill the function of amplified host by allowing the virus to be transiently replicated and then transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reservoir guest.
Epidemiological data retrospectively revealed that the initial SARS case had had contact with game animals.
Subsequent research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Civets of masked palm trees (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were recorded after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that the civets of the wild masked palm trees or farms without exposure to live animal markets were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that the civets of the masked palm trees would only act as an amplified intermediate host, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, as 80 % of the various animals on Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities for several species of small mammals to also act as buffer intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
They all appear to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Later searches of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called the Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat coronaviruses share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats harbor emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
The WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of bats was shown to use ACE2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter cells.
Amazingly, serums from convalescent SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
The bat CoV-HKU4 and the MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The RNA polymerase RNA sequences of the MERS-CoV phylogenetically draw closer to their betacoronavirus counterparts of identified bats in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in specific neutralising antibodies to MERS-CoV, as well as camels originating from the Middle East in several African countries.
A living MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans isolated itself from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, which further supports that camels act as bona fide reservoir hosts of the MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus was observed in camels infected for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread viruses not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus spread of bats.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species hosting MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the future coronavirus of virtually identical bats.
Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses.
The genomes of this new pangolin coronavirus share an 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of around 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like virus sublineages in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In stark contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigos in lung samples, which are equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of manual assembly and healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the entire length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-coronaviruses.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterproposal advocates a recombination between the pangolin beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animal.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while parental HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses have been found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Apalache mountain coronavirus) detected in a North American tricolor bat was reported to have a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the knowledge so far of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of events of coronavirus transmission of humans between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from livestock animals in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of transmission between species of HCoV-229E is not known with such precision.
Bat alphacoronavirus has been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alphacoronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alphacoronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring HCoV-229E-related alphacoronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogens in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronaviruses act as a genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, in particular in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats, is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by later findings.
It is clear that bats contribute, with a wealth of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus propagator."
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced in dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate host, to being a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of the MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-coronaviruses, as are civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities of transmission between SARS-CoV-2 species from animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through killing or coal mining.
Second, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody study is needed in domestic and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronaviruses to cross species barriers.
First, its relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the adaptation phase of coronavirus to new hosts.
The coronaviruses have an exorribonuclease reading test, the elimination of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, the remdesivir nucleotide analogue is known to suppress coronavirus replication by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, coronavirus mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of its guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of human adaptation.
It is to be hoped that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the coronavirus long RNA genome exerts additional plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination and, in this way, increases the probability of coevolution between species, which fosters the emergence of new coronaviruses when appropriate conditions are present.
This is supported by the uniquely copious open reading frames and the functions of the encoded proteins towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently change templates during RNA replication using a single "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a host acting as a mixing vehicle, chain change occurs frequently during coronavirus RNA transcription.
Full length RNA and highly homologous subgenomics could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing the transmission between species.
In the present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in inter-species transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-CoV of humans and civets, SARS-CoV is believed to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, in particular with mutations in protein S RBD.
In general, coronavirus protein S RBD interacts with the cell receptor and is highly selected by host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in fragment S1, which binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD is capable of recognising ACE2 receptors from several animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing transmission between virus species.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from isolated strains of human viruses and civets in the RBD and 4 of them were found in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental to the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30 % difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the binding affinity of protein S with human ACE2 could have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates the affinity 10 to 20 times higher of this binding compared to that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-receptor might be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, the HCoV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, after transmission between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also determined by other factors of dependency and host restriction.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to the transmission between species.
Human coronaviruses must usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors so that cross-species transmission is successful.
In this respect, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-guest interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
An objective full genome investigation of the dependency and host restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using state-of-the-art CRISPR technology could be beneficial.
Appearance of new human coronavirus: let's start from scratch
The diversity of bat coronavirus offers numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic pool of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes have the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered important in the adaptation to humans, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was determined that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A 29 nucleotide elimination characteristic of SARS-CoV was found in isolated strains at the onset of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes guest change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lineages, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Recombinations locations were also identified at nsp9, most of the nsp10 and parts of the nsp14.
Similarly, epidemic MERS-CoV has been shown to have undergone recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses are recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from freeing viruses from selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to a removal of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 could be observed in HCoV-229E-related bats and camel viruses, alpaca alphacoronavirus has an insertion of a single nucleotide, leading to a change of frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by selection pressure on its reservoir guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Apparently, bats are well adapted to anatomically and physiologically coronaviruses.
For example, defects in activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduces the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the natural killer cell inhibitory receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the elevated metabolic activity of bats could suppress coronavirus replication and affect the reading test of exorribonuclease, which provides the screening pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new coronaviruses of humans have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They are vigorously replicated without causing a strong immune response from the host.
Here lies the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers exist and what causes serious cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has dissociated itself from the replication of coronavirus.
The same strategy of decoupling the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammation in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line leading to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat beta-coronavirus has been found to share a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals on the markets have been found to host viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolonavirus beta-coronavirus has been found to be notably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-coronaviruses could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either deliberately or accidentally.
Coronaviruses have regained prominence due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Vasta evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing the civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolines should be withdrawn from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several lineages of beta-coronavirus of pangolines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be elucidated in future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with the wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could appear that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is great potential for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on poor experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan for preparedness and response should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to move away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing from the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin puzzle.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it must be elucidated how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a bat, pangolin, or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent viruses are expected to identify in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuous research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team issued a rapid guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of the new 2019 coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and constitutes a good reference for combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2.
On March 11, 2020, WHO rated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid guidance guidance that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support your important work and express our appreciation.
However, his work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case it is necessary to combine any point of epidemiological background characteristics with two points of clinical manifestations for a thorough analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations must be met if there is no clear epidemiological background:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported within the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported within the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed case groups (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) features in images of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at early onset.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some characteristic pathogen or serological tests as follows: (1) real-time polymerase chain reaction test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing a high homogeneity to the recognized new coronaviruses; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of the specific IgG antibody against the negative to positive SARS-CoV-2, or titre increase ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood or airway samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Detection of pathogens from blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then, serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us that we should be cautious with asymptomatic and symptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case", we recommend looking for and complying with the newest guidelines from their countries of origin.

Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the largest in a day
Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in one day yesterday.
It's the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were staying in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
An official at the hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being served at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video ad, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transportation would be suspended for longer than originally planned, until this next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, with two men returning from Italy and also the woman from one of them.
As of 19 March, these three had already recovered.
More than a million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea stated, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1 051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244 000 coronavirus cases were reported, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were over 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Across the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to earn their wages without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, curfew was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their sanitary paper purchase limits to two and one package per transaction at all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were posted as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Consumers were reportedly being supplied for fear of COVID-19 if people had to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited home delivery purchases of toilet paper to one package per order.
These changes were introduced after the previous four-pack per transaction restriction applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the application of the four-pack restriction, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within an hour of delivery," and said the demand "was unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected."
Sales went up with a "strong rise" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a Wednesday special offer planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers try to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It foresees an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, following early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make Wednesday's special offer.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets stock up every night.
He stressed that toilet paper is a voluminous article, which causes a low amount of stock in numbers, and, when exhausted, leaves a large empty space on the shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea that [that] if there were an abundant amount of the article on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [buy] and there were large amounts, it would probably minimize panic, Russell Zimmerman said by ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday that they exhausted stocks.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, noted that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain supply, according to the report at News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had free time on the long weekend of Worker's Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page letter designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report of 3 March, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Although the word "pandemia" refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, try, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
We are very concerned, both at alarming levels of spread and severity, and at alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic "is unprecedented."
In statements published by CNN in February he stated, "in addition to influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been traced from onset to continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, and said "we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
"And we've never seen a pandemic before that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic condition arises following the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the United States National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it will get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2.
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international importance on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and around 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364 000 people recovered.
The case-by-case lethality rate was estimated at 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04 % in Algeria to 0.08 % in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping distance from other people, and controlling and self-isolation of people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and closures.
The pandemic caused serious global socio-economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies compounded by panic-induced purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus was disseminated over the Internet, with incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant cases of viruses.
Owing to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases, for the most part, were related to Huanan's wholesale seafood market, therefore, the virus was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person who was known to manifest symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last group on the wet market.
From the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two thirds had a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to November 17, 2019, of a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province, could have been the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded, for the first time, the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of uninformed cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who underwent COVID-19 tests, and who obtained a positive result confirmed according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies of not testing people who had only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected in China, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the amounts of infections in Italy were considerably higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time elapsed from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were from people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased people who tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The number of actual COVID-19 deaths may be much higher, as people who died without the test may not be included, for example, in their homes, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of COVID deaths by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is an understatement," a claim corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the United States. This understatement is frequent in pandemics, such as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global proportion of deaths on cases is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths on cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with onset of symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the fatality rate per case, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died from a disease, and the rate of fatality from infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a disease.
These statistics do not have a specified time frame and consider a specific population from infection to resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the mortality rate for pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the case-by-case lethality rate estimates.
WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, usually stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But, at the moment, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen."
China's government's leading medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said that "it could end in June" if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will remain in circulation, possibly for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more) is available."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, since it is so easily transmitted, will disappear completely" and "could become a seasonal disease, which reappears every year."
The virulence of reappearance would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less frequent symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people get seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pressure or pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and bluish color on the face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended when these symptoms manifest. Further progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, not present clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm the infection, therefore the researchers advised to monitor and carefully examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; more often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during close contact and through small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to studies, by coughing without covering the mouth the droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by speaking. Respiratory droplets may also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although the virus is usually not transmitted by air.
Droplets may enter the mouth or nose of people nearby or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, therefore, aerial propagation.
It can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through the stool, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may be possible before symptoms manifest and at more advanced stages of the disease.
People obtained positive results in disease tests up to three days before symptoms appeared, indicating that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, usually one person infects two or three others. The virus survives from hours to days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the UK authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have touched infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2 is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the associated coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies upon contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (line B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the complete genome level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between pangolin viruses and those of humans.
To date, the comparison of the entire genome indicated that pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share at most 92% of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it is ultimately confirmed through the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography imaging.
According to a study in Wuhan comparing polymerase chain reaction with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using computed tomography as a method of detection or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually done with a nasopharyngeal swab, although a swab may also be used for the throat. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be precise enough for their widespread use to be approved.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features of symptomatic individuals in X-rays and computed tomography (CT) images include asymmetric peripheral defusing glass opacity and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of the results obtained in images of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed imaging by polymerase chain reaction has limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A comprehensive study conducted in China compared the results of chest computed tomography with those of polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in the images, both with X-rays and computerized tomography.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with your hands without having washed them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission; many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members do not know where or how they became infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions, and use eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive on the COVID-19 test. Wrong ideas about how to prevent infection are circulating; for example, nosewashing and mouthwash gargles are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bath or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with at least 60% alcohol in volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands without having washed them before.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 % ethanol, 50–100 % isopropanol, 0,1 % sodium hypochlorite, 0,5 % hydrogen peroxide and 0,2–7,5 % iodized povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or disposable tissue to cough or sneeze, and throw away the handkerchief immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected wear surgical masks, as the use of a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by the respiratory droplets that disperse when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene." It has also been recommended to use masks on people who care for someone who might have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the US, CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when in close contact (1 metre (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transportation or be in crowded places.
Thai health officials recommend people to make cloth masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited going out into public spaces without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask by being in public spaces to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured ten million masks per day since mid-March, on April 1 demanded the use of masks by passengers on intercity trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks for those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to curb the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can implement methods of social distancing by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact, and physically distancing themselves from other people.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at increased risk of serious illness and complications, and CDC recommends that they stay at home as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began replacing the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term “social distance” has had the effect of assuming that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in touch with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations to just have sex with a person you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Detailed instructions on proper self-isolation have been issued by health agencies and many governments have demanded or recommended the self-quarantine of entire populations in affected areas.
Stricter autoquarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to do autoquarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies to control an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at identifying and isolating infected persons, as well as introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk that health services will fail and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closure of schools and cancellation of mass events; community commitment to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and surface cleaning. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its severity became evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection assessments and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which diminishes the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for health care by two thirds and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but should be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), otherwise transmission is rapidly reactivated when measures are made more flexible.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases for use in the treatment of COVID-19 are being investigated.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a key response measure to the outbreak.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating positive patients in COVID-19 and increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are several theories as to where the first case may have originated (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, that it has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were observed which Dr. Zhang Jixian was in charge of at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
The police admonished eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
By early January, sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation; during the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation center and a major rail crossing.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that, as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364 000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as housekeeping orders, local shelter orders or confinement) and curfews. As of April 2, around 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in some form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
As of 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of confinement, increasing to 2.6 billion people two days later, about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on November 17.
On 26 December, Dr Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and her hospital reported to Jianghan's CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
Early genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission at first stated that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between humans.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "people's war," to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in the history of mankind", on 23 January a cordon sanitaire was announced that prohibited travel inside and outside Wuhan, this extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government implemented more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, which included the issuance of health statements for travelers and the extension of the Spring Holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macao implemented a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote working measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was changed and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor outings. Following the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. As of 23 March, in mainland China only one case had been transmitted nationally in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveller who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of nationally transmitted cases was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, two months after confinement was imposed. On March 26, 2020, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from entry as of March 28, with no specific details of when this policy will end.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese Government urged companies and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided financial stimulus packages for the firms. The Council of State declared a day of mourning that will begin with a three-minute national silence on April 4 at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online to comply with physical distance in order to avoid the resurgence of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, attributed mainly to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to have been the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, out of 9336 church followers, 1261 or about 13% reported symptoms.On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the maximum alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, increasing to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after evidence confirmed that three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airlines schedules were also affected, and therefore changed. South Korea presented what was considered the world’s largest and best organized program to test for the virus in the population and isolate infected people, as well as identify and quarantine those who came into contact with them.
Methods of detection included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new arrivals from other countries through a mobile app, drive-thru centers to perform virus screening with results available the next day and increasing diagnostic capacity to be able to perform tests in up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities. South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions demanding Moon's removal from office for what they considered to be a poor management of the outbreak by the Government, or to commend its response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases on a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance in testing the virus from 121 different countries.
On February 19, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran spent five billion rials to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a center for spreading the virus after China.
Amid allegations of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than 10 countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March, 23 of its 290 members reported positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners as well.
He indicated that there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of 17 March, at least 12 Iranian former politicians or politicians in office had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times more reported cases in Iran.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran could be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the relief of economic sanctions for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new law decree to contain the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "You will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events in those areas has already been ordered."On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but, on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the interruption of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics on triage protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3405 deaths from the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128 948 confirmed cases, 15 887 deaths and 21 815 recoveries in Italy, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that Italy's combination of a large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high rate of lethality.
The UK's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he discouraged social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two people and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those deemed strictly necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, the police could enforce these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersal of meetings.
Most companies were ordered to close, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Government's leading public health institute, announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in testing, which concealed the true magnitude of the outbreak at the time.
The testing was tarnished by the faulty test kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of approval by the federal government of the non-governmental test kits (of academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for individuals to qualify for a test until early March (a medical order was then required).
As of 27 February, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of 13 March, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

On March 26, it was reported that the United States had more confirmed coronavirus infections than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, 400 335 cases had been confirmed in the United States and 12 841 people had died.
According to media reports on March 30, US President Trump decided to extend the social distancing guidelines until April 30.

General approval of Trump's crisis management has been polarized among partisan lines.
U.S. officials and commentators criticized the U.S. dependence on importing critical materials, including special medical supplies, from China.

On the other hand, China’s aid was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the SARS outbreak of 2002–2004, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided regular updates to avoid panic at Lunar New Year holidays."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that, while "definitely not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and said that "it was unprecedented in the history of public health." On 30 January, following confirmation of human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance (ESPII), the sixth ESPII since the first call for the measure during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that ESPII was "due to the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without sound health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement."
On February 5, WHO turned to the global community for a $675 million contribution to funding strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries "that do not have systems to detect people who contracted the virus, if any."
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future."On February 11, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, had agreed to provide the "power of the entire United Nations system in the response."
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which enabled the coordination of the response of the entire United Nations, which, according to WHO, will enable them to “focus on the health response while the other agencies can provide their expertise to address the wider social, economic and development implications of the outbreak”.
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team with China was activated to provide international and WHO field experts in China to assist in national management and assess “the severity and transmissibility of the disease” through the organization of workshops and meetings with key institutions at the national level and to conduct site visits to assess the “impact of response activities at provincial and county levels, including urban and rural environments.” On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic”, and noted that, although it was still too early to call it a pandemic, countries should nevertheless be “at a stage of preparedness”.
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a reality check for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and we must be prepared", insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also said that current data did not guarantee that public health officials would declare a global pandemic, and noted that such a statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "very concerned, both at alarming levels of spread and severity, and at alarming levels of inaction."WHO has received significant criticism for what is considered an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the petition for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733 000 people on April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of all people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts stressed that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, persons in detention, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the crisis by COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a policy tracker per country, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese Government has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the United Kingdom Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, and the son of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) were dismissed because of their handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political system's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe this measure was taken to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger at the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, dismissed an earlier recognition of the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favour of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has referred to coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", and claimed that "China's censorship overpowered a virus that has now become a global pandemic," which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distraction" of its administration's failure to contain the disease.
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. Government describing a communications ploy apparently originating in the National Security Council, and citing the strategy as "Everything about China".
We have been told to try to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Media like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of propaganda to gain global influence.
European Union foreign policy representative Josep Borrell warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the politics of generosity."
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, United States sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries to their own country.
And there have been reported disputes related to masks among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which was affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, following a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" which claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of engaging in an "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio dismissed the press reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a medically aided cargo plane to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment gain momentum, they will also be able to match if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted on a small scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defense 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries involved, but also of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government was greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of Parliament infected, as well as fifteen other current and previous political figures.
On March 14, 2020, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, and said his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak boosted the demand for the U.S. to adopt common social policies in other wealthy countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts," after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea will be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was at first polarized with respect to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions demanding the removal of Moon for what they considered to be a government mismanagement of the outbreak, or to commend its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament and the elections, and sanction those deemed to have disseminated false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed for several cases of shortages of supplies, as a result of increased global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions in logistics and factory operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases left by empty shelves of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, leading to shortages of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning of delays in the delivery of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical items.
It also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that this would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas was affected by acute food shortages.
China and Italy's efforts against the accumulation and illicit trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding an acute food shortage anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its significant agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could rise, according to representatives of the sector.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pigmeat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to maintain stocks for these emergencies.
Damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a March 16 newspaper report, China's economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to government action to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a threat of considerable destabilization to the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges of potential consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could outweigh those of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of over $300 billion on the world's supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have been "disturbed" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
On February 24, world stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average published their most pronounced falls since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the biggest drop in a day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
All three indices ended the week with casualties of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH asserted China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Actions fell again based on fears of coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many consider that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, the closure of public places including travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise companies sector reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important travel season related to Chinese New Year holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year festivals, while private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year tourist events and attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in care schedules or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50 to 60% drop.
This also led to a 33 to 43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Commercial operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than those left in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the Wuhan epidemic, around 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were stranded in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government aid.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some form of unemployment. About 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since confinement began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented government-subsidized short-term work schemes, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term labour compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which had an impact on the operations of organizations and on people, both employed and independent, around the world.
Culture and arts organizations sought to fulfil their mission (often publicly funded) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists where possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, entertainment venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and increasing consequence at an accelerated rate of illness is the cancellation of religious services. Important sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the season of Christian penance of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of taking part in Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live webcast or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and Gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then the shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Euro, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak interrupted plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will be "rescheduled for a post-2020 date but not after the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gambling locations around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to turn to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their rates of new registrations. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as those on Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and share their work over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live live shows or creating "festivals" on the Internet for artists to perform, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous Internet memes about coronavirus were disseminated, as many resort to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and Eastern Asian descent, and towards people in areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most of the cases were still limited to China) have documented racist sentiments in various groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered a fair reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiments.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside.
Following the advance of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first European country to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed calls for a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults as well as assaults.
United States President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, who share a border with China and study in major Indian cities, reportedly suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata party's state unity in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "wrong." In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents increased as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign rubbish" and destined for "waste".
Many newspapers with payment walls removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the reverse transcriptase polymerase polymerase chain reaction test, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be highly overestimated in some countries.
Through the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained through several methods, including nasopharyngeal hisopates or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test performed on pharyngeal hisopates is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people who are tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by suction catheter, or the material that is expelled by coughing (sputum) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of 23 January 2020, the UK had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, South Korea company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It looks for the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp gene. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the emergency use approval of the National Medical Products Administration of China for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel for the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kits generated unfinished results due to defective reagents, and a jam in conducting tests at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only thereafter were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of tests for COVID-19 based on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, as of 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made available tests for COVID-19 nationwide.
No quantity limits were announced; the collection of specimens and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Care Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid similarly received FDA emergency use authorization for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses the isothermal amplification technology of nucleic acids instead of polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are around 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test using a monoclonal antibody is being developed that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (protein N) of the new coronavirus, hoping that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid test for influenza.
As of March 2020, the review of publications concluded that "chest x-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results [computerized tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms appear."
Typical characteristics in CT include bilateral multilobar opacity in defuse glass with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, pattern in paving and consolidation develop.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended "not to use computed tomography as a method of detection or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, CDC has recommended polymerase chain reaction as an initial examination.
Part of the immune system's reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and to monitor the population. Tests can be performed in central laboratories or by testing at the point of attention.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratory tests, a single peripheral blood specimen is usually used, although serial specimens may be used to monitor the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by a puncture in the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is needed prior to analysis. On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and can therefore now distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval from Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase polymerase chain reaction test.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the start of the infection. In early April, the UK discovered that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspicious patients can stay at home, "the emergency department gives the patient a specimen tube", the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result soon. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient will infect others if they go to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In the tests in drive-through centers for the COVID-19 suspect cases, a health professional takes the samples with the appropriate precautions.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10 700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, tests were offered using the drive-through system in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, by the calendar week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analyzed, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for analyzing samples of 64 patients simultaneously, consisting of grouping samples and only doing more analysis if the combined sample is positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI opened an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2000 square meters called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: "Fire Eye"), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to deal with quarantine would have doubled without this capacity for testing.
After Wuhan's laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow evaluating up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid handling robots.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols involving heating the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more coronavirus screening tests per person in its population than any other country, and was on track to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at the population level of Group 42 and BGI (which was based on its "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of polymerase chain reaction tests with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude to operate outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed the testing available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on testing.
On the contrary, experts say that South Korea's large availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its testing capacity, mainly in private sector laboratories, over several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to reduce the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of hisopates and chemical reagents were depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained imprecise results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to the incorrect collection of samples or the incorrect use of kits.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the kits that produced incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China that proved to be imprecise.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them in use." The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but, in early April 2020, announced that they were not serving.
Tests, supplemented by quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of those with whom they had had contact who tested positive in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death by COVID-19 occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests in the entire population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days apart.
Approximately half of those who obtained positive results had no symptoms, and all cases detected were quarantined.
With travel restrictions in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore advanced much slower than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28 Singapore began to recommend them to residents to stay in their homes, but schools reopened in time after the holiday of March 23.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracing, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantines, but with less stringent confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have performed more tests, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who only have mild symptoms or who do not have symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that have no testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as % of tests" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people who enter hospitals will have a higher number of positive as a percentage of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Washing hands, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
The constant washing of hands with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, e.g. diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral means.
People can also get infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or the common cold, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry meat.
If no soap or water is available, the hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After you blow your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause a disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease from the hands.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate at home births.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in hand washing practices can lead to small improvements in the height growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, and this is similar to providing safe drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of under-five mortality, killing an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bath into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhoea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is generally integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and causes the skin to become scaly known as eczema of the hands or dermatitis of the hands, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (orienting, defecating), after cleaning a child's tail (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry meat.
Other times when a correct hand-washing technique should be used to prevent disease transmission include before and after treatment for a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or ringing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced hand washing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97%; the United States was about half with 77%; and China had the lowest rate with 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behaviors, to increase the adoption of the habit of hand washing with soap at critical times. Group hand washing of children in school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate hand washing into the behavior of children.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of tailor-made action to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, in addition to washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin improves by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective in cleaning the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Studies that analyzed the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Even so, CDC states that "liquid soap is preferable with dispensing controls that do not involve using hands."
Antibacterial soaps have been promoted intensively for a health-conscious audience.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that using the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserve antibiotic-resistant organisms by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as promoted.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, vegetable extracts). A thorough analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer containing triclosan to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Nice hot water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to remove the natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using lukewarm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is an agent without water for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the 21st century, hand hygiene agents without water and with rubbing alcohol (also known as an alcohol-based hand solution for rubbing, hand antiseptic solution for rubbing or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants to rub remove bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants based on rubbing alcohol containing 70 % alcohol eliminate 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to the reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-based hand solution should be used to rub, as to moisten or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dry.
Finger tips should also be washed well, rubbing them in both palms. United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend hand washing before hand disinfectants to rub, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid micro-organism removal activity; however, they should not be used as a replacement for adequate hand washing unless no soap or water is available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants may dry the skin unless emollients or moisturizers for the skin are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing emollients caused skin irritation and dryness significantly lower than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based hand solutions for rubbing are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis was attractive compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect it.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends to a large extent on the ingredients and the formula, in addition, historically, has been much less than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions for rubbing.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ashes or land.
Ashes or earth may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that, if the earth or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, while water temperature seems to make no difference.
Rub your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Scratching creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Rinse in a container may contaminate your hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let the air dry.
Wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated again. The parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails
Artificial nails and shelled nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent the hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate hand washing when no running water or soap is available, such as pouring water from a hanging can or pumpkin with proper holes or using ash if needed in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home taps" and other economic options.
A home tap is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended pitcher from a rope and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective way of drying in public toilets.
More and more research has shown that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towel industry association, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was detected that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, by 194 % in the fingertips and 254 % in the palms.
Drying with the air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total amount of bacteria of 42% in the fingertips and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying their hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other bath users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), reportedly managed to blow the micro-organisms of the hands and unit and potentially contaminate other bath users and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes in bacteria count were observed after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel, when you don't have soap or water.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant must contain at least 60 % alcohol.
The hand washing of doctors became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff members to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
Washing the hands of doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of soap and water or gel to form foam and rub all parts of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together by intertwining fingers.
If there are remains under the nails, a bristles brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water in your hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, use the paper towel to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from becoming contaminated again on those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care environment is to eliminate pathogens ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that correct hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating hand washing and standard hand rubbing in health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's hand hygiene guide can also be found on your website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if proof of compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap ( "medical" or "antibacterial" soaps) gives the hand washing agent the possibility of elimination.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before surgery, you need a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a bit of chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush to scrub and another sterilized instrument to clean under your nails.
All the jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
Do not wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsed, water from the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterilized cloth and a surgical gown is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after caring for sick people.
To control staph infections in hospitals, it has been shown that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases more than 35%.
Washing with common soap results in more than three times the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that rubbing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective at reducing the AH1N1 influenza virus and hands-difficile Clostridium spores than alcohol-based hand disinfectants. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centers may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand disinfectant and written and oral reminders to staff.
Further research is needed on which of these interventions are most effective in different health-care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is seen as an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good food.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing behaviour.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few hand-washing taps near public or private toilets, although there are economic options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be the result of entrenched habits rather than lack of soap or water.
The promotion of hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing and bring about a change of behaviour in the population in the long term.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and cost-effective measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can eventually move from one to three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing promotion campaigns being carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that seeks to bring about behavioural change. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020, UNICEF promoted the creation of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-care-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters were hung with "right hand washing techniques" next to the washbasins of public toilets and bathrooms in office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing your hands" is a statement that you don't want to take care of something or share the complicity of something.
It originates from the Biblical passage in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much broader phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience about the crimes she had committed and had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been proven that after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value more the elements for hand washing.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to be involved in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water, but without soap, is part of the washing of ritual hands in many religions, such as Baha’ism, Hinduism, tevila and netilat yadayim in Judaism, washing in Christianity and wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend the washing of hygienic hands, particularly after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force them to wash their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam force them to wash their hands before and after each meal.
Workplace Risk Controls before COVID-19
Workplace risk controls before COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational health and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and work task and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal working contact with the public and co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand washing, recommendation to workers to stay home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards, and maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Work at risk of medium exposure includes work requiring frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected by the current community transmission or by an international journey.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high efficiency air filters, protective covers and personal protective equipment available in case there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care and funeral workers, exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19, are at high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or handle samples from these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work because they get sick, because they have to take care of others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which goods are demanded and in terms of the means of acquisition of such goods (such as buying at non-peak hours, through home delivery or window delivery from the car).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted; a plan for preparedness and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from household and community environments, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Plans for preparedness and response to infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an outbreak include reducing transmission between staff members, protecting people at increased risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used occupational health and safety framework for classifying risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to worker behavior and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the hazard to the worker, appropriately placed (e.g. respirators), properly and systematically used, frequently reviewed, maintained, replaced if necessary and disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed of in a proper manner so as not to contaminate.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal employment contact with the public and co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, the recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards that include covering when coughing and sneezing, the provision of paper handkerchiefs and containers for waste, preparation for telework or staggered shifts if necessary, discouraging workers from using tools and equipment from outside and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member; and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at risk of medium exposure include those that require frequent or close contact at less than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, high-concentration workplaces and some large retail environments. Engineering controls for this group and higher-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective covers and the placement of a service window so that the customer can ask from the car.Administrative controls for this group and higher-risk groups include recommending sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting up staggered shifts, suspending non-essential travel to places with existing COVID-19 outbreaks, developing emergency communications plans that include a forum to respond to workers' concerns, providing up-to-date training and training for workers on risk factors and preventive behaviours in relation to COVID-19, training workers who have to wear clothing and protective equipment on how to use them, providing resources and a possible working environment that promotes personal hygiene, requiring frequent hand washing, limiting activity, limiting workers to wear out clothing and protective equipment.
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper handkerchiefs when he coughs or sneezes.
The cabin crew should wear disposable surgical gloves to treat a sick passenger or to touch potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, perhaps, personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected subsequently. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruise ships and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include postponing sick travel, self-isolation and immediately informing the medical centre on board if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical control should be carried out in the cabin of the isolated person. In the case of schools and childcare centres, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass gatherings, such as physical or choir education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between desks, staggering the opening and exit times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, it may be considered extending the cancellation of classes. For police personnel carrying out routine daily activities, CDC considers the immediate risk to health to be low.
Police officers are recommended to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning wipes before re-use and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers are in high or very high risk of exposure.
Among the jobs at high risk of exposure are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicions of COVID-19.
These become very high-risk exposure jobs if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicions of COVID-19 or if they take or handle samples from these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests, or invasive sampling.
The high risk of exposure mortuary work includes those in which workers are involved in the preparation of corpses of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected of having it at the time of death; these become very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19, even when they undergo aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be suitable in some health care settings and morgues.
Samples should be handled using Biosecurity Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who are admitted to different waiting rooms be separated depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators with NIOSH-approved filter mask or higher should be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes adjustment tests, trainings, and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted through body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of incoming patients.
For those who take respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19, give them attention or transport them without carrying out aerosol generation procedures, the WHO recommends the use of surgical mask, glasses or facial protector, gown and gloves.
If an aerosol-generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the provision of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, the limitation of a patient's room admission permit with COVID-19 only to those persons involved in their direct care, the use of the same mask without removing it while providing care to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protective equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

CASE: [Covid-19] Lighten the burden and prepare for the future
DATE/TERM OF SHIPPING: 14 March 2020, 00:24 a.m. Coordinated universal time
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that make up the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern that we have seen among all our colleagues in email messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible are the people we are lucky to work with.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud that you're all my partners.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
I was reminded how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Your work makes this possible, either by keeping the sites running, helping our colleagues get paid or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and timelines
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be very useful for the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, shop or go to a doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If he's sick, don't work.
Although it shouldn't have to be said, we say it.
You don't need to ask for sick leave or paid time off; just inform your manager and help your team review schedules and timelines to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, let Bryan of T&C Operations know so T&C can help with support and make sure management is aware of your situation.)
People who work per hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our hourly contractors and staff colleagues.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This applies also if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it's about your personal care.
What we ask is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and we can adapt correctly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and change our approach to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all concentrate on the most essential projects.
Slowing down today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We do not plan to "duplicate the hours to catch up" when the pandemic is over.
He will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to set new targets and deadlines where appropriate.
What happens to PPP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and caring for loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning burdens and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will communicate the next steps to delegates and teams as soon as we have a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Office condition, exhibition and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our flat.
The building has adopted its own care duty protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared by the time we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our New York City colleagues already know, we have also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely since before know that this modality requires an adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings at intervals of not more than one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over several days.
Set the meeting clearly with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt video usage by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls the questions in the chat and list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email message to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the wellness refund for snacks.
Join the channel #remoties in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work
The HR Operations team is analysing guidelines on ergonomics based on webinars to support the increase in work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This past week we asked all beneficiaries of community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edits, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed you that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible for you to carry out your part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidelines at Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The overall feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness at the interruption and, in part, relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both at Wikimedia and others.
CRT will henceforth be working to establish a Meta-Wiki page to provide a space for the community to monitor impact and follow our communications with them.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19 matters
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 h, coordinated universal time/07:00 h, Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're available to help in the way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information from this email message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are being largely affected today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, any coverage issues, or anything you may need help with, feel free to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If you have sensitive or confidential issues, send an email to Bryan Juden, director of HR's International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be considered an abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that, at this time, our work and our obligations should probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will still be there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of yourselves and take care of your families so that you can be in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as a point of entry to cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is usually called hECA2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metalloenzyme that contains zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of Peptidase M2 and a C-terminal domain renal transporter of collectrin amino acids.
ECA2 is a type I unipass membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is splintered from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane of type II alveolar cells in the lungs, to the enterocytes of the small intestine, to venous arterial and endothelial cells, and to the arterial cells of the smooth muscle of most organs.
The expression of mRNA of ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striated body, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of the ECA2 is to counteract the ECA.
ACE divides angiotensin I hormone and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ACE2 splits the amino acid carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also split several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV's S1 ear protein and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes within the cells.
This input process also requires the preparation of protein S by the host's serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing the levels of ACE2 in cells could help fight infection.
However, various professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing standard ACE and BRA inhibitory therapy .
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors and had an increased risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in mortality related to pneumonia, although the results were not as solid for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24 hour course of effect (duration).
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. RhECA2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile device software applications designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who might have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular with regard to systems based on tracking the geographic location of the application users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support those Bluetooth-based apps directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. An application called TraceTogether is being used in Singapore.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia it was launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned to be used in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol of Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geo-perimetre application for patients living in Moscow who have received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering at the University of Cambridge, exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extension of monitoring and surveillance would have to have termination clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related objectives;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined by law;
Protections against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to such abuse should be implemented;
The significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter hone Grenzen, RSF) of Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from your operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, a network-based rather than application-based location tracking was used, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers for intercommunication only (see next section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application was used to carry out contact tracing.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected persons.
In addition to using this information to alert about possible contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, which is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not yet been published.
Tracking contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a lot of published research going back, at least, to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN) and mobile contact tracking protocols and mechanisms for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never leaves the device and all pairing occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location data or intersection of routes to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical report "Out of Control Applications: How to Keep Personal Privacy During an Epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly consistent protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect for broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for tracking contacts that they assured would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, it is intended to implement the system in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent surveillance issues by first distributing the system through OS updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulatory proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites with the ligand.
The analysis of these binding sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-directed polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ribophosphatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several medically relevant compounds that were then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an authorization for urgent use (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under an EUA only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors have said that they use the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Faculty of Medicine of Langone is conducting an assay on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would turn to the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for women who are pregnant or trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir antivirals and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticisms have emerged about the allocation of resources to the readaptation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international trial Solidarity.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple phylovirus, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in a more severe disease and transmission.
Early studies prior to trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two run by Cleveland University hospitals; one for people with moderate disease; and one for those with more severe disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C are ongoing for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial with Alvesco (cyclosonide) of Teijin, an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
An angiotensin 2 converting enzyme form, a phase II trial is ongoing and 200 serious patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women, who breastfeed or who do not have an affective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines for its use.
On 14 April, a multicenter study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are devoting much attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that developed for earlier outbreaks of the SROM, SRAG and Western Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that were identified for possible rehabilitations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five potential vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investments and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the targets of the main platforms that went on to phase I safety studies are the following:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumed to be planned or developed).
A Phase I or II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, placebo-controlled and multi-site, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease while controlling the adverse effects that occur at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active-development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet under evaluation in humans (they were still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly subject vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine and hopes that human testing will begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotechnological associate, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for vaccine development.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in treatment with neoantigenic cancer vaccines.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that the tests were beginning.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Associates also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, although it advances rapidly, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The potential vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine'," to which the German government complained.
On March 17, 2020, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The potential mRNA-based vaccine BNT162, is currently in preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of the preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human testing of the possible final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to USD 29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing animals for six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College of London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine with self-replication against COVID-19.
The potential vaccine developed within 14 days of receiving the Chinese sequence.
In late March, the Canadian Government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, including a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and Saskatchewan University initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced the testing of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that "SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines administered by MNA obtained potent responses from antigen-specific antibodies (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal sprayer.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacteria and produce virus-like harmless particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with COVID-19-specific animal models, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlights the need for tier 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SRAG that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAG was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When the SROM became widespread, it was believed that existing research on SRAG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one SROM vaccine (DNA-based) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were ongoing, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one vector vaccine of MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory according to which the virus causing COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
Patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the SRAG coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious contagion disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
While these droplets occur when exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect that they have the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that they not be worn, others recommend that they be worn, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking, and bluish face or lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
Symptoms in the upper airways, such as sneezing, runny nose, and sore throat, are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is unknown at the moment and is being studied. Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking aloud releases more droplets than when speaking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth when coughing can cause droplets to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside people's dormitories tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can lead to the aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spreading through the stool, the risk is thought to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that although it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, one person usually infects two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours in products with 99 % copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way. Soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and deactivate it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses of a related nature.
Outside the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, as it bursts its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells using the type 2 (ECA2) angiotensin I converting enzyme, which abounds most in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spicle" (peplomer) to connect with the ACE2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, an acute heart injury was identified, which is most common in severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptom rates are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be related to receptor ACE2 in the heart.
The receptor ACE2 have a high expression in the heart and participate in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to poor prognosis. In autopsies of people who died from COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes were detected in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by epithelial cells that express ACE2 of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that pathogenic GM-CSF secretor T lymphocytes correlate with the recruitment of IL-6 secretor monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In the autopsies, lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on samples of the airways obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swabs or sputum samples may also be used.
Results are usually available between a few hours or two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but two blood samples must be taken two weeks apart and the results are of very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that world laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCRs) to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were developing, but were not widely used.
Experience in China with testing has shown that accuracy is only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the University of Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular grinding glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, disorderly cobblestone pattern (septal lobulillar thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoerytroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without washing your hands.
CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and, if you do not have handkerchiefs, use the inside of your elbow.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of fabric lids in public places, one of the reasons being to limit transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies seek to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling mass public meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people should keep a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Since there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, at the earliest, a key part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "flattening the curve".
CDC also recommends washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when your hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant that has a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when water and soap are not available in a timely manner. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to achieve, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for antisepsy of the hands".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are given supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy, and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they have the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms in the early stage of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the US compiled the recommendations of several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend acetaminophen, rather than ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care settings when procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation, are performed.
CDC recommends health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 to place the patient in an air infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to prevent air transmission. CDC highlights guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is an EPP coat, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, respirators (rather than masks) are preferred.
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use by means of an emergency use authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications is not guaranteed.
When no masks are available, CDC recommends the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for people hospitalized with respiratory failure related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure in the airways.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provides the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases occur mainly in older adults (those over 60 years of age and, in particular, those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, which limits the ability of the health system to manage the sudden increase in severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory distress syndrome (APRS) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, several drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe illness.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. FDA granted temporary authorization to convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect the "narrow contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-confining, but also alerts local health officials. Analysis of large data from cell phone information, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they were in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the data from mobile phones of people suspected of having coronaviruses.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared summary phone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breaches.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators have informed him that "in any case, 40% of people are still moving."
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42 000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a worldwide request for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may be distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, and the side effects of treatment, or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may follow a mild evolution with few or no symptoms, so it will resemble other upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk for serious infection with the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SRAG virus and SROM, but data from COVID-19 are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In more severe cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to water distress syndrome (SDRA) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, impaired clotting and cardiac, renal and hepatic damage.
Coagulation impairment, specifically increased protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; whereas renal function impairment is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average time of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In an incipient case study, the average time from the manifestation of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among males was 2.8% and among females was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes in pneumocytes were observed.
The image of the lungs resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage resulted from elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalized had a pre-existing condition; the availability of medical resources and the socio-economic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of disease mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Insufficient count of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is understated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung imaging suggests organ involvement.
This can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have been reported cases recovered from COVID-19 that subsequently tested positive in coronavirus.
These cases are thought to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a re-infection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, by means of an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is not known, but, by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as of December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to laboratory confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 infection to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lethality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall lethality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the rate of lethality in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed dying of a disease, and the rate of lethality in infected people, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die of a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information on how many people became infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the younger ones, resulting in relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all COVID-19 deaths have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overstepped.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among males in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for males is for those in their 50s, and the gap between males and females narrows only at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 for males and 1.7 for females.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immune differences based on sex, the lower number of women who smoke and the fact that males have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in males.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were males and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were males.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track information about sex in COVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAG, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nursing staff, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to viruses, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations on naming to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
It is common for "coronavirus" to be used to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common for the virus and disease to be referred to as "coronavirus" and " Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 names were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal swabs and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the provider could not deliver it within the required time, a local start-up engineered reverse and printed the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information, and misinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease that quickly spread over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Test" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the receptor ACE2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are looking to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the protein S that helps the virus get into the ACE2 receptor.
A third strategy is vaccines of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are over 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Readapted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, including nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries and which are due to report by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical developments on vaccine and potential drugs against COVID-19 was under way in April 2020. A number of antiviral medicinal products for the treatment of COVID-19 are evaluated, including: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the USA, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. Preliminary results were obtained.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for the investigation.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it points out that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an authorization for urgent use for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
It has been recommended that further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide be performed after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial s-protein primer performed by type 2 transmembrane serine-protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with receptor ACE2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine release may be a complication of the last stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent cytokine release. China’s National Health Commission included tocilizumab in treatment guidelines after completion of a small study.
It is found in a non-randomized stage II national test in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, these effects will be countered, which is believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
To date, there is no unrandomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a method of passive immunization without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which a passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
