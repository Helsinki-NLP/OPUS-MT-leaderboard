European inflation slipped into food
Rapid inflation, recorded in the euro area, is due first of all to the rapid growth in the price of food products.
The increase in prices in the month of November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, recording - after 2.6 percent of the month of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Statistical Office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts only gave as likely 3 percent - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and the reduction in forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "you have to negotiate" on inflation so that it doesn't have to intervene on this issue at a later stage.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, broke the twelve-year record; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation skyrocketed in the euro area as a result of rampant food and energy prices.
Wheat prices at the end of the year increased by 88 per cent and soya prices reached their peak since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching black gold by nearly $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from the current 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, while by 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will continue in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, during 2008 the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup foresees a government crisis
After a long stalemate, by early December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its peak level since 2002, while the Gallup never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe voters of the parties - due to the greater firmness of the voters of the opposition - would mean a support of more than two thirds (71 percent) against the support of one fifth for the socialists (20%).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the limit necessary to have any parliamentary scandal: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the sure voters there are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
With regard to the next year, the majority of the population was experiencing a deterioration in the situation and only one tenth expected improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of those consulted, a figure higher than any previous Gallup survey, estimated that the President of Government performed his duties rather poorly than well.
13 percent of those consulted trust or rely heavily on Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of those consulted.
54 percent of the population doesn't trust the Head of Government at all and 27 percent don't trust the president of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced with the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 percent estimated that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, currently this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33%) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation responded that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
By comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" only 55 percent of the population would surely participate and another 15 percent believe their participation likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
Seventy-four percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study fees, 79 percent of the medical consultation service and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average price level increase of 16 percent was maintained by the hypermarkets of Budaörs' gold trading triangle, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the commercial golden triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the daily Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth well above the thousand HUF.
As prices in food supermarkets had already been "shot" in December last year, this was not the case with a drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the nine thousand HUFs, today they cannot do even for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest-value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liqueur and fish remained almost at the previous year's level, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, nut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this shop that the price of the Coca-Cola with a redeemable bottle of two liters cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's basket it was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased with 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices listed in Napi's basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket with that of this year's cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while growth between last year's cheapest and the most expensive basket of this year has been 21 percent.
Average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during last year's Christmas in prices the increase in VAT was felt.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, that supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of circulation of a product, he may lose an important profit in the margin that fits the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of Napi's basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, the most expensive being 1720 HUF higher than the value recorded in 2006, while at the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
No such extremes occurred this year, as the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic increase in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of consumer goods of first need grew more than 30 percent.
(However this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some staple foods, recorded in the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30 percent.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst cases only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all the indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose the drastic increase in prices even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most of the consumers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking the preserved foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, in all three stores large queues were formed ahead of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because income falls short of their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Several thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals this year, first of all due to the improper application of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene circumstances in hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds and the overload of the staff do not favor the control of the infections - says the doctor-head of department of the National Center of Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, MRSA contagion has been diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A person injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon afterwards had to return to the hospital as a result of MRSA contagion and since then no major surgery has been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10 of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the Nosocomialis Surveillance National System - said Karolina Böröcz, medical chief of department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents has surely been recorded, and the rest have no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is applied exaggeratedly or improperly to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics become very resistant to antibiotics and rapidly spread under inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, e.g. wound infections or septicaemia in the first place in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with weakened bodies, the elderly or people of low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of Hospital János there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistant
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff treats them in rubber and mask gloves and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalised patients are previously examined for MRSA presence in their body, but even so infection cannot be avoided in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of formation and contagion with multiresistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the sick who carry MRSA in their body.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most of the cases come to light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - said the doctor-head of department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict mandates for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is directed, that is, microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of travelling patients or in basic care - Karolina Böröcz said.
Saves with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is spread from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but also in this regard there are considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is spread through droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately you can also experience - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favorable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for the infection.
In Karolina Böröcz's view, where appropriate preventive measures are implemented, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the contagion of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA contagion is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is fought against in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has as its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of the XXII district.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a dazed state can be excluded since then the resigned police commander of the XXII district, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passerby - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of primary alcohol control which had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then chief of the XXII district police station, on Tuesday with his private vehicle turning to Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district, ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the pedestrian-designated area.
(The latter fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police leader resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian finance minister János Veres and vice president of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of €400 million to finance infrastructure for education, transport and the environment, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance transport and environmental protection projects in the Hungarian budget, which will be made out of the Cohesion Fund grant, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this target for Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million the decision will be taken later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovation and research project of Debrecen University.
During the talks they also covered the issue of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalizes the details of Metro funding with the EU, it will revert to the issue of whether or not the original contract needs to be modified and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is in accordance with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU Real Estate Paradise
It is admirable the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country mentioned above.
What thing, where and those who buy in the EU's even cheaper market, which will quickly get more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred objective for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is without a doubt Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches of Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Likewise, the capital Sofia can be attractive, commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a top destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example around Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the beaches of the Black Sea and in the ski paradises.
Foreign clients can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price of between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They demand good communication and access, and it is important for them to be close to a large city, shops and usually a local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital buildings is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate significantly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six by hundreds Hungarians
As reported by the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, meetings at the expert level will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration, negotiations at the ministerial level on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world discuss the Bali Road Map that provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, up to 2012.
There are now lively discussions on the subject between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not wish to negotiate on precise figures at the moment, although it tends to agree that, compared to the 1990 situation, the emission of greenhouse gases will decline by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a board of directors composed of 16 members, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020, regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed and is willing to commit itself to reducing even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capacities.
Gábor Fodor noted that the signatory countries to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed themselves to decline by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU Member States committed themselves to meet an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 6% compared with the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply with - says the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
Much is at stake in Bali, since in two years' time the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed to after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments made in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the UN's international scientific partnership dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and would not prevent an increase of more than 2°C in the average temperature of the Earth, a fact that scientists believe would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: Special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar's general body of operations, then sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings coming from the air force soldiers who have been loaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defense headsquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Commonwealth of British Nations (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional television spots of recruitment - the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - but inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'être of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the distributor, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fights.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army has only recently taken advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with shooting video games, free downloadable, called America's Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty cake at the Christmas party of the ministries
It does not seem very sentimental to the Minister of Labor Mónika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to fire the year 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its feast with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with tombol and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how the power is enjoyed.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defence, but not for Ministry workers.
On the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, and for the Christmas of the Missionaries, the relatives of the soldiers who currently carry out missions abroad will be invited. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the holidays of the other portfolios
The festival of MET will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred ministry workers the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty is expected.
At the wallet party a Christmas atmosphere will reign, artists will also perform and there will be tombola draw.
The Christmas of the ANF cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party to be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we were unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of Lucia's day on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The party began with the minister's words of greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to wear a suit or dress at night.
The health, work and local government portfolios are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organise a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
On the other hand, Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year working meeting.
There are 180 guests who - as reported by the press department - will have only coffee and salted pastries, so the party will not cost more than 350,000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai instead will simply toast to his colleagues in the Ministry's classroom for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own hall of events with the participation of 436 workers.
The holiday party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - this budget will pay the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, the workers of the MF every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year reception on January 20, at the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple reception standing, to which will be invited only the specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary.
These receptions, which are held every year, start with a brief greeting speech by the minister and end with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget for the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will set up a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the strike on Monday that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stoppage will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as rail traffic will stop completely and workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike until 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon the League Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike to be held jointly with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Trade Union of Machinists will also be formed to coordinate Monday's actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while the participating unions will strike for an indefinite period on Monday, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for a strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
Based on the Monday agenda of the National Assembly it is also possible that only the public health law will be voted on at very late evening hours, or perhaps around midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, significant difficulties will have to be faced in transport: on the railways work will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the Volán companies may be stopped.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon the State Railway and the Free Railway Workers Union (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on minimum services, although, as Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours will be on strike the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 in the morning, will hold a strike of four hours the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Trade Unions of the Educators called a strike of 2 and the Democratic Union of the Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take a national strike at alternative times and the Health and Social Workers Democratic Union (SDTSSS), which are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal regarding public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will come into effect next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, for advanced pensions, the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect another proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, from several points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the company's "risk warning" it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes can occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between Roma and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the stability and democratic development of the country".
They remind us that: from the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups of Hungary received increasing publicity and momentum and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been formed in the country that define themselves as "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, of the army, that is to say of the state" - they add.
They said: all this is done in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and political parties.
To highlight the civil aspect and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, in many neighbouring states they referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries, want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard functions in the same way as for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of the extreme right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the mass riots of the Gypsies that took place in one of the neighbourhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defence."
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained impotent and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has sparked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also the Hungarian Gypsies react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Political Capital's investigations, asked the news agency's question: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the coming anus will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America parties are not unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holidays, state holidays and festive days.
The festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical events.
Let's celebrate the New Year also: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, a day commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th we celebrated the founding of the State, on May 1st the feast of work, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day feasts of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when before or after the holiday there is only one working day.
In exchange for weekends so long, on previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
He is the minister of labor who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal rule is binding on all employers and their employees, as well as on public employees and civil servants.
It is not mandatory, however, for companies and service institutions which, because of their function, work uninterruptedly even during festive days.
This year the work order can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24th practically stops life in the country, because according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our parties will coincide with mid or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be changed around the work party so that, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2nd will be a festive day.
The other change relates to the feast of October 23rd: on Saturday October 18th, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year to come during the end of the year will be able to rest, since from December 24 you will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to embitter your colleagues' lives
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing it: all of them are part of our daily Folklore at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Tips.
Sorry, I forgot to let you know that you were wanted from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to fix the matter, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message to you (this is the least common solution).
In most cases the matter is settled by apologizing.
Before proceeding to embarrassing explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can embitter the lives of your colleagues and strive consciously to avoid them.
You borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, an office clerk or your phone and you can't find them.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your missing pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they'll no wonder be mad at you for taking their stuff away.
Don't take envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out of time.
You gossip about your colleagues' private lives?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the particular lives of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's confidence when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know the things about him.
Are you leaving on sick leave unreasonably?
When you phone the office and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or well, you feel that day you prefer to rest; think about others doing your job, your urgent tasks, your work by term.
Don't screw up your buddy!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you will have to stay home, communicate to them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront your absence the next day.
Shouts, giggles, phone calls
You're into your job, but your colleagues' giggles suddenly get you out of it?
Have you inadvertently heard a telephone conversation that would have been better not to listen to it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarareos, chants, conversations out loud (less when you make them above their head), patsies, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontents out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not delving into a project at the moment (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or message!
Do not allude to the chaos that eventually prevails in the office, nor to the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable room for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don't see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be unruly, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car is slowly moving into the usual morning jam.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm raising the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a real jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 plays Zagar's song Wings of Love.
National music life didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam seems totally different when you're listening to Zagar's new album.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national gradually change the image and although garage style rock is again in fashion, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, he played in the whole of Yonderboi until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he attempted to triumph, when asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the set that initially performed only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first album released in 2002 from among the fifty most important national records, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend-forming, able to be sold also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his group are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they are wearing this label.
The set reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better album.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the original years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of Balázs Zságer's ancient ensemble.
It is well the reference about the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a true success of the channel mr2 Petõfi which lately broadcasts from morning to night popular music. This station carried to the ears of the radios the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
Well, everything's in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are performing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There, not only the fifteen- and twenty-year-old generations frequent concerts, but also the oldest.
They pay much more attention to the changes taking place around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good seeing more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never written music for the market.
We don't write music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the public's expectations, you lose your interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works solo and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don't follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with his.
We rather work as a team, trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our works with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: On mr2's hit list Petõfi Wings of Love is in first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't mean to write great hits and sell with these hits our album.
This song is more than that.
We added it at the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the album and the heaviest songs.
hvg.hu: How have you selected the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main motive?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of good-voiced soloists from our own national musical setting.
Thus was created that choir of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was then baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you get the song exactly like this or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came practically to the first attempt and incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas as well.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the album it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's brief solo), they have no role of their own, they sing all together and no more strongly than music, so music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on stage are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They're in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song is also about it, about us forgetting for a while our ego, the one who where it came from and where it goes, so let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted others to feel the euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do the most work?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma where I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to run the groove and then, little by little everything was put to its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is how he points to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Trade Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, certainly, with good abilities.
He sensed long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's responses according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, reveal is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than €1.6 billion thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
It was precisely in the summer that he won 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity already saw her coming at the beginning of the year.
In February some news began to be heard about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't buy it and bet it right.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded €1.6 billion.
"When I won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, "that he hasn't left anything for himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even tricked the bosses, even though the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
The risk became a benefit
Were you afraid it would come to light?
More like, no.
"I thought I had earned 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, they would be happy."
Where did he get so much willpower to take such a risk?
In my position, we had to work gradually.
He entered work at Société Générale in the year 2000, exactly after finishing studying in Lyon.
His annual salary was in the range of $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I'd never win as much as everyone else.
"In my first interview in 2005 I noticed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel told the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first big success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a starter mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll leave you.
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the chiefs knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"While making money, they closed their eyes."
Only, then, came the blow earlier this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in the middle of January he wanted to erase all traces.
When he got to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost €5 billion because of it.
And how did they get a hold of him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of getting 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroons).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately SEK 125 billion will come out of seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kroner from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state transport infrastructure fund which will have the amount of SEK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to leverage resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
As regards the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly admitted countries that use them the least.
Twenty-year sentence for the former president of Nicaragua, ordered the court
On Thursday, Nicaragua's Court of Appeals decreed the 20-year sentence for the country's former president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of embezzlement of $100 billion (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, a while later, he was released from prison to go into house arrest on his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend rather on the prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they bring him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how Alemán was constantly transferring government money to a company's Panama account.
This society was fictional and the account belonged, in fact, to his closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund Alemán created to fund his campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how they approved the budget.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drawn up by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, calmly passed the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and budget item, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last Social Democratic governments suffered from three flaws that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as expenses of the presidents that are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit in public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from tax, tax and credit money from banks, often issued, pointless, obligations to which they disproportionately owed their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, of what ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put order on state finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be in debt.
The rest of the countries, except for some like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, into the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why massive social programmes are not necessary, which, unfortunately, in recent years have in vain swelled up with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending passed this year before the elections, if the retirement age and pension reform do not change soon then it will be the real end of any policy in this country and, govern whoever rules will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians who govern will be transformed into civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure on the normal expenses of the presidents' expenses.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, had the last government not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We would not want the politicians who govern to become civil servants alone, so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and fees, peace of mind for the preparation of other law reforms.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be received in the Monetary Marking by means of tenders.
In these tenders banks auction interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will bid $40 billion, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks of different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and lessen the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group in his report for customers.
"This coordinated action by central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what awaits them when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro's leading economist, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really wrong," he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems with access to loans and will therefore have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they did not manage to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, London interbank rate that is used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," he told Reuters agency, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks helps to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Environmentalists’ debates are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
Criticism now emerged with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not green planet, he commented that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are hardly structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this topic is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said "many times I find myself only in the caricature of my ideas".
Interested parties can now find out about their various opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main time of the closure, he expressed his belief that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent potential disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development are futile, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke of the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed the date and thus failed to change their old driver’s license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for change so that officials will give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads after the New Year without a valid license.
According to traffic, the license has not been changed mainly by those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of card, the metropolitan offices are full of requests and interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 customers a day.
In the queues, half an hour is expected.
Around 140,000 drivers have not yet been taken out of Prague.
The issue of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must necessarily change their license and do not reach the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid license will risk a fine starting in January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can arrange the offence with a warning.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine shall amount to SEK 2,500.
According to the above information, a fine could be paid to a person who is not going anywhere.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices for moderate fines of up to 1,000 kroner.
According to the member of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand kroner do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should hand over the driver's license.
Simply bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will gradually have to change the other types of driver's license.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplice detectives.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych are going to spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided on the final expiry of the reduction of sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the Prague department against organized crime were, at first, going to fall between 14 and 12.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only through revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused but he is first awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this, in other trials he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation in the robbery of 19 people and the High Court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused ' s charges were rejected by the investigation because they were fabricated cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members according to Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped members of the criminal group avoid penalties.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The prosecution refers to the criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as theft is concerned, their victims suffered serious health impacts but are also charged with abuse of power as public agents and without a weapons permit.
In the house search, police found pistols, steel core ammunition, a laser director and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the accusation, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
Except for almost twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to Berdych's case are still declaring from other proceedings, and in some cases have not yet appeared.
Tomš Päät and Maroš Šulej, who have now avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change some children: 12 million
For changing children in the maternity home the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million kroner of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, disagrees in principle with Veleba's proposal.
"We do not approve of such a demand, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the specialist report that the counterpart sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has any rescission value.
We maintain the view that it will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostál said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jabloň's family wanted, for each month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at the hospital of the faculty of Motol in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was best endured by the men although they fought with recriminations for the change of the girls.
“Women are taking it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what is happening today,” Veleba said.
Veronica and Nicola were traded for nurses at the Třebič Maternity House last year, December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered each family 100,000 kroner in late October as compensation costs for the error committed in the Třebič hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and extraordinary can ask the administrator for help.
The court until today recognized them with proportionally low compensation, the amounts that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily of a million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the Kingdom of Wallachia brand.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tomš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr.Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, the image of the actor and comedian comes to everyone.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us for about ten years.
Searching for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit lies in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that for that I could also receive something.
They want to live like parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court the Kingdom of Wallachia brand was first used by Polívka on his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not a question of orienting him towards the creation of a fictional kingdom.
A few years later Harabiš came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comic origin it turned out a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabiš later created the society Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature on passports and even offered his holders discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who dedicated themselves entirely to it.
The collaboration, between today's broken parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment there began to be conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the chosen forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš derived into singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his society, which until today has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of it.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We're in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr.Polívka can present himself," added Harabiš.
Peugeot Test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
To tell you the truth, I've never really liked Peugeot 206.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But his successor, Peugeot 207, now exists on the market, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little bit more advanced and I just have to think about it.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the headspace in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters of length.
Flying around the world
I pass through the interior quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value the invention of design more although the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained of short seats and backrests.
Also in contrast to model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And the space, and here you can feel how the body measures have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned shortage of space in the header disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is his trunk.
This one I must value as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear gate) and a well distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that represent an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot lags behind with its discernible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child's stroller its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the floor that is quite flat after the backs of the second line have been knocked down.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 who despised the family member five doors.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, has impulse.
If I compare it to the time of the škoda then it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged in by a rag, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
Prices answer
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 kroner, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we'd still have airbags on the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything, it costs 531,900 kroner.
It's a lot, but count on the team's complements in the Fabia and it will reach a fairly similar number.
Now it is only left to decide which of the two marks.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
English schools are attended by children from Eastern European countries and therefore locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans so far brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between migrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak emigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion, and broncs among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said that the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak émigré.
The girls treated him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to leave, he made us the ademan of throwing apples and pears at us, and then he pulled his pants down and showed us his ass" he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with migrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools is beginning to be quite tense.
In Britain there are registered 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be accomplished, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the all closed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island does it find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of loading of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He was ordered to build one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, as everything that had crime in the United States (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings emerged in Havana, along wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio the stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita abanense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those already cult cars of the 1950s, to this day continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rusted among these humid and salty winds.
Although Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surrounding area as there.
Other places are metamorphosed in beauty, for example, Trinity.
Because tourism brings so much needed money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels grew not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow tracks in steam or electric machines.
Their garages have not been discovered for tens of years and are now there, machines that work and whose sister models in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And for this reason, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned hacienda of Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not fail to visit it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing in limestone lands.
Mogotes, limestone pylons and steep rocks in the falls of the valley, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the cigar factories in Havana can find its final product.
Someone might find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was shot there.
Trinidad
City of old abolengo that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by French settlers arrived later, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountains of Escambray, is such a remote place that still in the 50s of the last century there was no road linking it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and neither was anything destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Ancon Beach or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small city in the extreme west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years after the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, Santería, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, could fill many pages of all this.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it once.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment are influencing the mission's march in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to American Defense Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working out as thought, the representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week, through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to become more active, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population themselves to begin economic and security development," Defense Minister Des Browne told BBC radio station.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to data from the American army is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have around 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, one quarter of whom are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of unit organization and equipment.
Exactly ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar vein, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I am not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries in attendance in recent months there is a controversy over whether all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
It was criticized as passive, for example, Germany.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands for struggle there are not as high as ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun, this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan rebels discover that the Germans engage in play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troop played a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will reach billion in 2009
For each Czech the State owes 84,000 kroner.
The total debt amounted to SEK 842,700 million in September.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kroner.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to SEK 152.8 billion thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic's state debt grew at the end of September to SEK 842,700 million.
In nine months this year it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
Since June, however, it has decreased by SEK 13.4 billion.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt of early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 kroner.
Throughout the past year, the State owed more than SEK 111 million.
"For now it seems that thanks to next year's low deficit we could pass the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and billion kroner," said iHNed.cz server, Homeland Finance economist David Marek.
Similarly, Next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora sees it: "We could spend the billion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene were seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don't see such a change," he added.
Doubt Grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The state debt is paid through treasury bonds, state bonds, direct loans or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The foreign debt so far has grown from 1.7 billion kroons to 123.3 billion kroons.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z since June was reduced by 13.700 million kroner.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarter created 13% which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is a 20% growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," said Pikora.
Better than expected
From the strategy of the state's debt payments and management for the year 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend 159.2 billion kroner.
At the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by SEK 152.8 billion thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million kroons instead of the previewed 91.3 billion kroons.
The rest is made up of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about SEK 13.3 billion, the reserve of SEK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, SEK 43 billion for the financing of the state's obligations and SEK 1.8 billion in payments from the European investment bank's loans.
I was comparing in front of a court today to Khartoum to have given a name to a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan to insult Islam has been sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British was accused of having let pupils aged 6 to 7 give the name Mahomet to a stuffed bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
He was subject to a penalty of whipping.
This 54-year-old British schoolteacher based at Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan has been arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with an attack on Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back in fact to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the picture of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear he - himself bore no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting towards a religious faith, "I'm sorry only that he asked the children to vote for a name ", it's just an "innocent mistake " according to him.
Opinion divided by many pupils of the school teacher who describe her as " very attentive towards her pupils " and " never speaking of religion in class " .
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the most given middle name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished a sixth and final discussion session Wednesday morning to Baden in Austria without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a status agreement ", said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , its American counterpart, Frank Wisner, called for Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist ".
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated to 90% Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was commissioned by the UN for a new mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, the Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his sorrows.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of independence of the province.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the 1990s wars of independence.
" For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible. "
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a right of veto.
" The Parliament of Kosovo shall have the last word "
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia ", Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had declared.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush breaks a deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of his own international peace conference to Annapolis in Maryland on Tuesday, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive regulation of the 60-year-old contentious point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides ' obligations regarding the path to peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues " .
This name covers the three main difficult problems of the disputed point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and deepened" and refer in all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things."
Going up to his return in the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what the forthcoming negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the end of the implementation of his " vision of two co-existing Palestinian and Israeli States " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made an effort in this regard on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects ", says Prince Saoud in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just as every time in these kinds of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the Inspectorate General of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17 Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"He was not in intervention but on patrol, and he was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating lighthouse ", explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorized to drive on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " full gas " .
"He percussed the police car on the left side, after a breach of the cede the pass to the right," the police say.
The alcohol control performed on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (the front plated, windshield cracked, bumper ripped off) attests to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into " acts of manslaughter and denial of help " to the IGPN, which was co-located with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor states that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stadium, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate three witnesses to the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the policemen, namely that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly to his left ".
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the shoes on the floor, showed that both vehicles had been stuck the time for the police car to come to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be the subject of a technical survey.
The bodies of both victims were autopsyed yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated by Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen would have left the site very quickly, not thus providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious fault " with regard to this point.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more research, on which one must be very cautious," said a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness to these moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that looks precisely at the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to reanimate them, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw " a completely dispassionate cop, who limped.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the room was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, apparently, with the certainty that the people present of the unexpected situation of the youth, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
Always according to this witness, the reliefs arrived "about twenty minutes after the march of the policemen ".
They also performed cardiac massages, in vain.
" I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not bring assistance to the youth.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police repressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who were demonstrating against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where cops loaded and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
To Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers required a general strike and announced demonstrations, resulting in a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement picked up on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president "encouraged the population to send flowers to the judges who pronounced themselves against the state of urgency and waste to those who took oath in front of Musharraf ".
Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled.
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly concerned with the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to rule in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential election, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
" Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court," the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf ' s promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian " no longer valued " president after the establishment of the state of emergency, said Monday to the assistant information minister Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Information Minister also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of armies.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unexpected
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one pregnancy in three (36%) is not foreseen, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better "fertility dominance", according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years is passed from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated about a month for a couple out of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the nicest to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn and indispensable solar panel for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, from the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "cracked" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday then that astronauts had released from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a cylindrical thick piece tasked with hosting soon European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see framed).
This module is a type of landing platform for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After having moved it, the crew began the reorganization of the module's solar panels that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which are deployed as accordions, has been damaged in about a meter or so by a cable that stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snailing at the end of the 30 meters long remote arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" of the Nasa.
Tall, resistant, very skilled, has very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician has been in charge of "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After having inspected precisely the damage, he severed the fallible cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " that had stayed near the airlock and, from the interior, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey baton wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "crushed" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a midday break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS Title sanctioned on the Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently on a sharp descent to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros to the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operational outcome for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport plane, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus ", announced the mother house of the European constructor EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without any more precise encryption.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS' operational result failed at 86% in 2006, mainly because of burdens linked to delays in another programme, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group anticipated a first handover of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the ballot box: Russians are going to opt massively for President Poutine's party, united Russia.
Confirming his aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message about the public networks, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed overwhelmingly.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with handing over a new burden against the West accused of interference - his topic of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, no incidents " he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign tarnished by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there is never "had such dirty elections, even in the time of Eltsin."
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, former world champion of checke Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Poutine to the presidency?
Yesterday the official newspaper published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and elected again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that elected the government and the president?
Whatever it is, legislative elections as well as presidential elections, outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, do not feel they own their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada centre.
Historian Nikolaï Kopossov, from St. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic release ", says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " give up of their own free will the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly given proof after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What's the point of reflecting?"
The phenomenon touches all social strata, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia..
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: " Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far accessible only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominated, at the request of a former victim or his successors.
The eleven States responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to search engines and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians ' access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct searches "particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers ", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after war for a practical purpose: to find the countrymen deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, possibly, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents " , said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade in Indo-European countries has reached nearly EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India look forward to signing a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union's Foreign Ministers had last April given their approval to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade now stands at around EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free trade pact will doubly bend both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans ", justified Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants change annually for "€47 billion of goods " and for "€10 billion of services ", declared this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential". L'European Union and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering £10 billion in five weeks
The bank of England on Thursday was concerned to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion to the base index of 5.75 percent in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" In order to alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight by the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its projected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , it states in a statement.
The bank requires that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market so on December 6 at 12h 15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
This is the first time it seems that the England BoE bank puts on the market liquids for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that " it is prepared to take further steps to keep the interbank lending indices " up-to-date in line with its base index.
The daily interbank index was 5.829 % on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6,6 %, highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty index that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the change in the pound relative to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny examination of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, among which the 50% increase in the bonus for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP (inner rate per oil products), a cheque-transport or rent restrictions.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the examination of the articles (180 voices against 115), the session has been adjourned at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition to some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more or less, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 confided to Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago's Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place August 8–10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival at the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organization of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as " the most inspiring event " he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's work parallel to giving the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as the market and worked with perseverance with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we stagnate in low-level policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones pursues.
" Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and we prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that will, lately, take place in Philadelphia. "
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, after having unmarked the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
" Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours is rather held in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of country festival to the European and urban way to the American way. "
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but affirms " that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life. "
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", as exemplified by the 80 000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been issued to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 companions, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal Faces Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood movie dishes into Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This mission of seduction is part of the function of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governator?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If you find conditions in Montreal to be favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that will judge the best," he says.
The race to festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskares is started.
All West Coast festivals, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle, or San Francisco, will have to present Quebecese films, give them courage, and make sure the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Age had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the billboard to Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival, in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to fire the end of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more so because, in the current context, uncertainties are lurking in markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of having the stock exchange take road in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight towards quality values in both long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since the peaks marked on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at this time.
However, the expert notes that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, values that we are close to technical levels and "thus we could see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree in choosing the values that will be in charge of taking the Ibex to new peaks.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it is up to great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some construction companies "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the climbs will come from the banks and the industrial sector.
The construction companies will also be able to benefit from this rally, if any.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will continue on their way," explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the holiday sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a bassist month.
The real end-of-year rally was held in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded an upturn of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate much of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 hours to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular's experience will be crucial if other entities are to opt or not for this initiative that supports the business schedules.
This is precisely the objective that Popular pursues with the project.
Get the private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, SMEs, autonomous and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodelling of the existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the clients of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the hours is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although if a greater hiring of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía of Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that with success, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the Mundocredit brand, specializing in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, that even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises of PopularMax will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' says Rivero.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We've made it.'
With that phrase he expressed yesterday his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the close of the market, when he found that the chain he ran doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: 'It is what hurts me, it is not because we have grown more but because we have come down less', he said.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That profit puts its loss in what we've been doing for the year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and invested by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.8 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (Five-Day Publisher) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we rent it in terms of audience.'
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television network to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
If this announced fact became real, the television network would record an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing this year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
On the other hand, Antena 3's net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million) while net TV revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution in the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría shared 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile claims that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to whom we have already given value with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It is due, they explain, to the fact that it has cut projected income growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has reduced Antena's forecast of profit by 3.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecuritys: recommends buying both securities based mainly on their high profitability per dividend and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: Go better to Telecinco (join) than to Antena 3 (keep) for the 'attractive multiples' and increase of the business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends underweighting in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which came into force 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activities of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves modernising financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial advisory services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and holding companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with existing stockbrokers.
The Act also obliges investment firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Committee on Economics, several modifications were incorporated, among which it emphasizes that securitized debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened with the debt of US high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to delimit legally the functions that graduates in economics and business can perform 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of the royal decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of marketing of products and of attracting clients to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonised CPI increases five-tenths in November, to 4.1 per cent
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance in how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the definitive data, which will be released on December 14.
"PCI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second Vice President and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that "even if the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We were expecting a figure around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged regarding the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock €42 billion in three years
Northern Rock deposits have dropped more than 50% to £12 billion (16.8 billion) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time, it was amassing record deposits of over £25 billion, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months because of the mistrust of its customers and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of that money offered by the Government and which will continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rebrand the entity with its Virgin Money financial trademark, needs to capture about a quarter of the revenue in British banks that will be deposited over the next three years to reach the remaining 18 billion pounds to reach the target of 30 billion pounds.
tycoon Richard Branson's group, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named Virgin's consortium offer this week, in which three other companies participate, as its preferred to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) today early in the morning for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the council and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo last May replaced Juan Morales, the current popular deputy, and until then the mayor of the municipality, and that according to sources of research consulted by Cadena SER, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The agents continue to search the municipal units and the town planning council and no further arrests are ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the deputy 'popular' Juan Morales, therefore in charge, was arrested leaving Morales's home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to head PSOE's candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the president of the government and general secretary of the socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of Congress in the event that the socialists win the general election.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE Secretary of Organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he had held this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "it does seem" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run for the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to devote himself to combating climate change at university level.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left her two years ago.
He also pointed out that, just as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or cry". and make it "become more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk calmly and calmly is Congress, the president of the government was once interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good doing" and has not already wanted to see himself occupying his position so as not to fall into what, he said, his adversaries could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change subjects both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles to merciless persecution, it is bound to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach obliges him to explain why his government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leading the EU in non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the breach, in which sectors it has occurred and why your Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires you to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spaniards what measures they are going to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to make, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been, nor will there be, such explanations.
It is precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to account for companies and individuals.
Even the cent of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he has hastened to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothingness, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it merely becomes a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend to travel by bicycle or cool off with the fan.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel businessman for possible urban crimes, today reported sources of the investigation.
The building was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose offices he is currently with numerous agents, who have also gone to the City Council for Urbanism and the municipal company for the management of the Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable so that the Galician company Nuaria would build 4,000 homes, following the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the case file, which is being heard by Court No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have now been brought before the courts.
According to the sources, the former governor of Totana and today the autonomous parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been imputed, as has the current bride of the former ruler, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., the director of Soelo de Inmonuar, an agency part of the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes were allegedly carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry business in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would mean doubling the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks of Coruña Street, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by the way leading the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that the criticism of Blackburn's book appeared, curiously:
"The content of the symbol of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Councillor in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in institutes."

A colleague passes on information about the introduction of Internet download offences into the Criminal Code:
A. The downloading of a song would be an offence with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs of less than 400 euros from the store, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros from the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than that imposed on unloading (art. 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than that of unloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous quarrel has a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without authors ' authorization is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's hand is going out, a very long hand.

My family doctor took one of his articles on rare research titled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less.'
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depend on what the comrades earn.
The study has been conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if when both were successful they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was higher.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet flavor, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on that list from which the documentary by Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach, 'The List of Carla' (2006, not premiered in Spain) takes its title, which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the criminals who fled and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is made in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed upon in exchange for liability for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the card, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the more likely they are to suffer an accident, the greater the fee to be paid.
This is why both women over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower accident rate due to their prudence.
Also, by using the recounts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of mishap.
By increasing the frequency, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver has to study the situation carefully in order to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face a number of disadvantages when it comes to purchasing insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the card.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is full risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a full risk free of charge, so that they can obtain insurance cover at full risk but at a more feasible price.
Such an agreement would require the customer to pay part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim contributed by the customer will be pre-established depending on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, Spanish top manager of First Europa, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A word of advice.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will impact on the bonus, being able to reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate held by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
After 25 years of age, drivers have it easier to hire insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to accumulated experience.
For this reason, the best thing is to hire a whole risk with franchise.
"Normally, young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired when it comes to using themselves in an accident, and even when it comes to driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children, it is preferable that he negotiate insurance at full risk, as long as his economic situation allows him to do so, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risks free of charge (this could be 300 euros), or, where a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchise," says Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is advisable to have all-risk insurance free of charge (with this being 150 euros), or one extended to third parties when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
Celtic seeks in Milan a point worth the eighths
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the league of the 'Champions', as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians score ten points and already certified in the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and who receives the Benfica, who has four, does not beat him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where he debuts on the 13th in semifinals in search of a place for the final of the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a win, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing in eighths.
Gordon Strachan's set could even serve a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar does not win, but cannot be trusted because at nine-point equality the pass is for Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to make the evening bitter to the Scots, who trust to get into eighths for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round the last campaign with a goal from Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the one way.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the triumph, in the event that he loses the Celtic, both to get into eighths and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, before some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before starting their concert at Vancouver's GM Place stadium that the group's meeting is "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to witness the concert that included a video in which the story of the group that raged at the end of the 1990s is told.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls took to the stage wearing bracelets given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd that packed the GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had banned it days earlier.
In the run-up to the show's start, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "has not seen our wardrobe, at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last performed together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special aircraft.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
There are seven children among the five.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will perform on December 23.
New gas fears between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia's export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every touch between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopoly owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine was to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that he will charge Ukraine more, as it has committed to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not be linked to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a decline in exports to Western Europe, which rapidly increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian nations.
NHS "must test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control criminal record records of employees outside Europe, a vigilante said.
The recommendation of auditor general Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the Glasgow airport attack, in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the amount of foreign personnel it counts on.
However, his report noted other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor general checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area, following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attacks in the United Kingdom.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal record checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The Auditor General's report recommends, among other measures, that boards should have the guidance of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff."
BMA Scotland President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work on NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have problems identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely complied with.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualifications checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the pre-employment policy and guide for foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon states: "I was very interested in this work being carried out following the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division's late vocalist, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for best film.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress by the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - featuring soundtrack by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only £3,000.
But the winner was also the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, awarded two awards- for best director and best debuting director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning at the ceremony - such as Julien Temple's film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the award for best documentary.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a boss of the Russian mob in London, in David Cronenberg's film Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50th, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth, and Sexy Beast, currently film the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, a Camelot star and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, he's really an honor."
Independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world's largest oil plant, following a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert," who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned the smuggling of eight shells into the country.
A further 22 of the detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping Saudis travelling to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda as militants in fighting Allied forces and supporting the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants target many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants—recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born leader of Al Qaeda, to harass the country's pro-occident government—had as objectives residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, since five months ago of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a 16-person "media cell" in Medina, whose aim was to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 others accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Climate of Venus can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus may have once been an appropriate place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a twin of Earth than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago."
Police seize "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare to be enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and send them for dissemination to candidates.
None of the questions put on the afternoon of Wednesday, November 28 were more ridiculous than the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the Republican party debate on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party in view of next year's election.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates for candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: issuers noticed peaks of approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest word exchanges of the night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation as he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (by allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
Neither has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both alerted on the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and generally speaking, candidates share views: increased surveillance at borders, intolerance towards illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fear of China’s toxic toys and other concerns abroad, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not believe literally in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's most recent poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, coinciding with Liberal Ron Paul's fundraising campaigns, and his heated statements from Wednesday's debate.
The two have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it likewise emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor sucked off extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour ruling party, over £650,000 ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election, foolishly insulting British intelligence by stating that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, as Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with growing wit, because the feared Mr Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and judgment poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative flaw.
A trio of retired generals began a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably walking towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes over.
Once it's clear that the prime minister can't improve things, that he doesn't have much time left, that suspension is over: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government gets defensive and doesn't focus.
In one part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Even if he wanted to renege on Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
Northern Rock's problems and the authority registration tax are related to Brown's decisions as chancellor of the treasury.
And even though it's not directly involved in Blairish's setbacks - or "partners' cash", investigating the funding of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been directly conned.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to gifts of charity, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those with power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that he was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, chief fundraiser who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these performances, although the bulk of the payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has done half the job.
He has been quick to convict his party for breaking the law, but he dilutes in decision-making over a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - largely led by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Public Life Standards Commission, as he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for genuine reform of party funding.
This will require hard labor co-operative work with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the trade unions - a long-term move for a party like Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Shark cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural for dorsal fins to swim excited around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days late, respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million charge in its American consumer finance business, partly due to weak card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Late payment and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in American bankruptcy law (2005) resulted in a sharp fall in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore late payment) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
Industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is quite strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exists: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than active securities, so falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ lending capacity.
They can even work to outperform issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decrease if properties are worth less than the loan value; and as a result, payment of card debt goes up the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders face, by changing interest rates or by altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid asset challenge.
"We're not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, head of finance for Capital One.
If a sudden infection of the subprime in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit crunch pushes America into recession, industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for the frauds with Enron's former head of the financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's fall.
The accusation against the bankers - he doubled the "NatWest Three" - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his previous senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron society, which was the architect of a myriad of frauds at Enron, which helped its spiral of collapse into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interest at zero, but all three British knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest at $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest on the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers collected 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted on two counts of conspiracy in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses seem successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension schemes.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were commissioned in the past years for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges was suspended when she died of a heart attack last year.
Neither Down nor Out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly straight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the wealthy Russians.
"It has capacity for up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
"But none ask for that model of so many seats because it's for family private flights or for company presidents."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumption orgy held at an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract the new wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany crafted yachts to the 50-cent diamond-encrusted car grills.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche in the booth next to his."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and cauldron compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
"We lived the same thing in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders".
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 % of Russians were below subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time alongside the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccablely prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon suits, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," Yumatova said, who reeled off the design suit he wore as a veteran carpet network dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new wealthy, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum penknife cutters, Mövenpick ice creams, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr.Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the Dutch royal Delft porcelains, in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in "bling-bling".
In fact, the sellers said that wealthy Russians with more trajectory (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from eye-catching logos to limited edition brands, which would not be displayed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress systems of $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grills, for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with embedded scratches of Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, will not necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, next to another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian billionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it is not in cash," he said.
"There's more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone booths (British style) filled with stacks of $1 million counterfeit bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on piles of money, or bagging a couple of million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karryev says.
Smash surgery could cause death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A little healthier" and saw an ambulance climb up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car showed up.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the ambulance coming up," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Investigators are now trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue house.
Authorities still don't determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but they're waiting for the tox screen, although the results won't be available until a few weeks, which will help resolve the mysterious death she has in the upper ranks of Newark's cop.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy says of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Drink Control Commission, and who left two 14- and 11-year-old children, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for the County Union prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh declared.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said the house arrived near 3 P.M.
On November 21st, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have said little about his investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a withered rose rose is located at the front of the house, and a barking Dalmatian on the back.
A blue drum labeled "Ethyl vanilla" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was located at the door of the garage, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the NYPD department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping to get to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
"She would say, "you have to watch with this or that," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's embarrassing."
Federal reserve is expected to cut fees to lift the Stock Exchange
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm down credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were increased with the reassuring comments of the US Central Bank vice president.
The stock exchanges were loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Ben Bernanke's number two President Donald Kohn declared that policy makers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October."
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
Observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in an overall cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at closure to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at closure to 6,306.2, adding over £39 billion to the value of Britain's leading companies.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, the resurgence of credit tension in the markets was highlighted following a strong demand at a three-month European Central Bank fund auction, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the federal reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained the credit and three-month lending rates "Libor" among British banks, signifying the biggest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England takes with trial the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection who is on loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because Hugh Morris's desk, England's director, is beginning to fill in offers to become a national selector, and if not, a part time.
Whoever doesn't get sixth place bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sports too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than for capacity.
Not only in cricket is choice difficult, because it requires judgments that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricketer, unless they give him the chance to sink or swim the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the captain's eye at the same time taking a "wicket" and a batsman to get opportunities to change order if he wants to impact as a player someday.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who plays surely in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for "fit and bowls" as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 runs for each to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of these.
Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to settle down at the same time who came to become a major player, and despite scoring a hundredfold against Australia in Australia, he may still be underrated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion in today's Asgiriya Stadium session, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greater experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah's favor is his brilliant and valuable early 88's debut test at Bombay, 32 hundred first class compared to only 6 Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent background against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two turns in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, he seemed to have taken from his battling some of eloan that in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team has the joy of living in swords.
He gets caught for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he overturned his vehicle in an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his team-mate who looked away, to say with excitement, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he bats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles who ran out of cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that is safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to cease for a moment.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime did not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that a U.S. Allied force helped to get Al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe that had been led from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad, by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues."
"That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops consolidated groups of "concerned citizens," armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many claimed to have returned because of visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shi'ite Prime Minister, called on the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them back to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who set my house on fire after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shia areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will re-emerge sectarian tensions and begin the struggle.
Little Saar, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its colleges.
As in the whole country, the Sarlanders lack only one field of education.
"Yesterday I explained for the 50th time to a non-Sardishman that we are not French" - that was the ironic motorcycle on themselves of the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Saarland education system which in a study of the German Institute of Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" ranked fifth.
Thus, colleges traditionally have good relations with neighbouring countries.
Saarbrücken University was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students from Saarland is higher than the average in higher schools, many of whom do not have a bacillirate.
"The Saarland takes advantage of the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the German Institute of Economics (IW).
More than every five young people do their baccalaureate at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that Saarland is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for vocational and academic education is very wide.
The offer of double careers, relative to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences dropped by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Saar Ministry of Education forced higher schools to make more publicity for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After PISA's first study, we made some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order for the children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of backward pupils in school development fell from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But in general, the Saar did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, even if they could achieve good results in this area, to the displeasure of the Sarlanders.
Although the Sarlanders were not French, the language of the neighbours was a compulsory subject in secondary schools.
Chavez changes the time.
Venezuela will soon have another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets the clock change in the South American country by delaying the clock for half an hour.
Currently Chávez is becoming a comedian in Spain.
As reported in the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will pass to less than four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States once imposed the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia due to hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would have no relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is driving a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide Sunday in a referendum.
This reform could greatly expand its power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas concerning the release of the hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chavez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was annoyed by the continued interruptions by the left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decline in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong juncture.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower actual salary account in 2007 than the previous year.
"The fault for that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the strain of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn told the newspaper "Bild" of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research on economic cycles.
New charges for unemployment insurance may also be borne by employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% by passing from year to year, is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the labour office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, prices are rising by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, something that had not been raised so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, researchers had suspected that rays could exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays are silent from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles tells the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms may have provoked reactions in the ocean that, for their part, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it's not like that: if there was ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface temperatures of 500°C reign, oscillating in such a way that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Possibly Venus is an Earth's "diabolic" twin, but he's still a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the mission "Venus Express" is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth because of its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for research on Venus.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to the opinion of the researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more characteristics common to the Earth than we had supposed," reports ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a cloud-shaped vortex that rotates faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost so large.
This planet also called dawn star or evening star orbit around the Sun nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: a day on Venus is 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and with its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble the Earth much, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed in the same conditions.
On the two planets water had agglomerated that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it was dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the inter-party fight over Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the grand coalition end that fight over the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as A Divided Nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of One China's politics.
China knows that too," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the reception of Dalai Lama and because of it was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperable foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the Tibetan religious leader in their official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battles with police in the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move into the streets.
Barricades were made, the vandals shot the police with rifles: after serious riots led by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We also need to look at the fact that our country's social problems do not take the form of violence."
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hanover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states, and municipalities are already working hard to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference: All this is already bearing its first fruits".
It's still early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young people starred in serious riots in the streets with police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolouse.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above the average.
It is necessary to ensure that there are more vocational training posts.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
It is necessary to "provide the opportunity for young people to receive a job or vocational training more quickly".
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel spent peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burnt cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been dealing with security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take rigorous measures until necessary.
The night of Monday to Tuesday around 80 policemen were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the youth was not the fault of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The action far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that nothing more should be expected of it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate action, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As to the reproach that was made to her for having repeatedly devoted herself to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that this would be a provincial way and thus he showed that he does not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the Lower House it was very clear to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
There could be no slightest interest, no feeling for the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it greatly praised itself for the decisions taken at Heiligendamm, but it says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years now the head of the Party of the Christian Democratic Union has not been able to afford so much modesty.
Well, he insists on expressions so that people can get an impulse.
And in this way it damages their public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in Angela Wolke's kingdom inner problems are appearances of little value.
Child poverty and concerns about low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about it using subordinate sentences.
It is impressive how many times you are wrong to talk when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more concrete information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of YouTube Republican presidential pre-candidates and must now fear only one candidate from the outside.
Tensions between candidates have already been noted from the outset.
Mitt Romney reproached his adversary Rudy Giuliani that he would have turned New York into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants".
He, for his part, responded with serious reproach: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani replies to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as so far the Republican group does not have a clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their adversaries.
The small 30-second videos, shot by Internet users who were sent to Youtube, also have little content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," that was John McCain's reproach to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one in the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives a lot of criticism from veterans of the Vietnam war, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown themselves simulate his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg in Florida show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised the conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
So you can see better where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At that time I was wrong," Romney explains.He apologizes to the people and the television audience for having been an advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president took an oath as president.
This is how the eight years of military rule in Pakistan end.
On Thursday Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he took power with an incruent military coup, the former general first rules the state as a civilian chief.
With his resignation from the position of head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main status of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state's attorney general, after the oath Musharraf will soon annul the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since he was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there have been many pro-Musharraf jurists. Last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new government chief’s election on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watirist region, five soldiers were killed and four others injured.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in one of the streets along the border with Afghanistan.
Krautrock's founders are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continues its activity: three members of "Harmony" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written at the band's best time.
Already in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of him his little box, his cables and especially his buttons.
In the middle is seated Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with its sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for the Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the band Harmonia was making music again.
What needs to be rebelled here is the following: the precise questions have shown that the band's name rumbled in people's minds, but it wasn't something so special that after 32 years the audience missed her so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the seventies?
Especially because the wrong Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of Cologne's Can 2003 band for their life work, in the room you could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times I did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
A while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and they had a name, Cluster, which promised great fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band which at the time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist's life full of surprises.
They say one day an Ottenstein Harmonia Song Association pennant appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not just to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up in esoteric themes and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and since that time has been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that's to thank Groenemeyer.
His Grienland music company set itself the goal of cultivating this German own contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius's work, the band Neu! was also discovered again.
Harmonia's performance as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade, is also present there.
In this way, all of Krautrock's influences on the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future".
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the legend's development is shown in the black and white photo projections, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Currently electronic music is as it had to be.
Three people who dig deeper into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere she coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis she sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always an English term of origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia remains calm.
On the stage there is a very good reflection on what is already evident.
Where does the music start and end?
That can break one's nerves or give a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to war in the Balkans.
But the two were not very convinced.
Either the concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkan mountain, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
Finally we had lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in women's films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument to watch perhaps the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why today the titles of the films have to be so long and foolish?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: deep down, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life already passed, who as a monument to the ruin of his decadence so far retained most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a nutshell: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, one of whom acts very quickly and that also leads to her falling in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we welcome the fact that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without freeway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" one can investigate, because in reality there was never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another script author (Richard Shepard on two counts), the story about American reporters in the war leaving to detect a war criminal Serb called "bitch", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and each time it turns out to be a trip in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first we are introduced to Simon Hunt, whom they do not let simply be a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Muslim Bosniac who are going to kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters of the world could not achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave them to the Bosnian Muslims to justly avenge themselves.
It's so bad, they feel like appealing to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against kinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in reality, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In films like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It is almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bloodful Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It has to take at least decades for Hollywood to roll a good film about the Holocaust, taking as an example the film "Schindler's List".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the Vietnam War plays "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every slaughter (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because scriptwriters don't have the slightest qualm (which is necessary to be able) to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" turned out so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look from an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied, "That's only because some things never change."
Big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives negative criticism of the Olympic Games in response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economics for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust recalls that one has to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director-general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday that this resignation was "not good for the economic location".
In the last time no other project in the big city promoted as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, the political, sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded that the Senate not forget this project, but find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics were not held until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust says at WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sports Federation (Sportbund) decision expected early in December, on Munich's application for the Winter Olympics of 2028.
"This preference means to us that in this period of time, which we so far thought we had until 2028, from the realistic point of view we will have no chance."
“Despite everything, this dream did not end forever,” von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity be taken away, if plans are now ruined," said HSB director Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application contradicts the statement of the head of the Senate made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Sports Federation of High Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for Universities of 2015 not as a "substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sports Federation of High Schools named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Fraction of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgersschaftsfraktion) reproached the senate for not taking advantage of the valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed with the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated Olympia planning for little Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's application for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Bright-Box of "type" on this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" cast doubt on the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm carried out internal research and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Musseet Museum, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of "Stockholm type", which are in circulation in the international art market, turn out as well.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that had "Brillo" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Moderna Musseet Museum hundreds of Brightness-cardboard boxes were exhibited. These were not made by Warhol (due to expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brilliance" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but examples (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed producing in Sweden some Brightness-boxes of wood, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Musseet Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of nearly fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Bright-Boxes" of "Stockhol type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exhibited almost one hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the curators of the Museum Moderna Musseet, investigated six Bright-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and embossed their tight silvers and then painted them in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silvers. Moreover, it is not about oil painting, but rather acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official Brightness-Boxes list," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Moderna Museet museum and adds that if The New York Authentication Commission "Andy Warhol Art" will not come to any conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as the copies/exhibition objects."
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in which these are soap dust boxes.
But from that moment there everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
The ringleader Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been entrenched in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had a Thursday trial for having attempted a coup d'état in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so he could suddenly deposit with about 30 supporters.
Evidently the military police who were to watch him had passed into their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called for an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security advisor, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
"People are fed up," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to move into our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who formerly led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
Great government critics called on Thursday for a major demonstration against the president.
For months now, his government has been reproached for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven attempted coups against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel's largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the telecommunication company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for a share is 14, 46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company's absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial share at Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of DSL (Digital Subscriber Line).
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entering the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its stake to the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 by hundreds to 15.1 by hundreds.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution maintains the equity securities for a third party.
United Internet already in the previous day involved with almost 10 by hundreds the telecommunication company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the measure of capital increase has placed 17,4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106,4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares of them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies started negotiations on DSL-products marketing cooperation.
"We strengthen our collaboration," explained the spokesperson for the United Internet.
The two companies founded a joint venture MSP to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, i.e., they involve 18.49 percent of Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all options, especially the participation of the public limited company Freenet.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now the holding of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch will achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
