The ČSSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop.
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will apparently have to overcome the obvious language barriers so that the members of the Prague Board and the City Council understand their renewed SDG colleagues.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new Council of the ČSSD to check their knowledge of the slang marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's political flower and cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proven that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a novice in Prague politics," said Councillor of Culture Lukáš Kaucký during the "college" terminology examination.
And as far as the veteran politician is concerned, Karel Březina reacted the same.
Maybe they know the concept "golf today."
"Possibly it's the only expression of all the people you asked me that I use from time to time."
"If not, I don't normally use slang."
From the glossary, the definitions of which were published in the newspaper Aktuálně.cz last June before the SDG voting congress, six examples were chosen by the editorial board, in particular those that are particularly related to Prague's municipal authorities.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "bullnuckle", "traition of the capital" and "blindar".
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a quarter, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolinek, refused directly to do so.
"I don't get involved in these things and I don't want to appreciate how civic Democrats have fun."
"What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the implementation of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, alderman Lukáš Kaucký would not have noticed that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does not tell anything; the only term he qualified on the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," Kaucký says, adding immediately, "But I rather know it from the news."
"I'm going to have to sign up for a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Environment Councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Afterward, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort and Lukš Plachý really is and even knows where to find that character; he also suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon Plachý is revealed that it is the headquarters of the companies of Janoušek.
Like Březina, he indicates that such knowledge gained them from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among the socio-democrats.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really seems like we don't have anything like that."
"Rather, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or we play word games with names," says ČSSD Prague president Petr Hulínský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
"At school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my classmates call me that too," confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper tested the name and it works.
For his party colleagues, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), Representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they teamed up before the deceitful election during party sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") from some of his teammates.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Praguen president.
"The doctor of baton rights" apparently recalls that Petr Hulinský obtained his Ph.D. in Law from the Bratislava police academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of “witches”, as published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are often elderly, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "turn" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer such fate."
"Nor are healthy young women isolated, because they help in the work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of West African state Burkina Faso, takes care of a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information booklet that should help prevent witch hunting.
However, this has a catch.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read," warns Die Standard about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Allegations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, a neighbouring country in Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was caught in the oil used for ritual anointings.
It caught on fire when the group wanted to "expel the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people at all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "Human soul eaters always posed a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease witch hunting, in the Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a large hunt for witches who, supposedly, had been related to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To help him he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, were forcibly taken randomly chosen men and women from Gambian villages to the president's property in Kanilai," Amnesty International says in its report.
On the farm, the arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay on the estate.
Following international pressure, some 1,000 people were finally released from detention.
Bakala's Tenant: Heats up with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, old and tough, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnate" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he was carrying documents with the new three-story leases: his, his daughter's, and his son's, who is serving his sentence.
All three have just been caught in the liberalization of rents.
Instead of CZK 3,500 per month, the child will pay from next year CZK 4,100 for a two-room apartment with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, it has no hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, over whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains half angry, half resigned.
Civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, man only makes a gesture.
"Everybody says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major test laboratory for liberalisation.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of Ostrava's four and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to pick up number.
"Rent 2011", can be read on a bright button of your touch screen.
When you press it, a little piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
It hardly gives time to read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rents.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as in the past: requests for arrangements, insurance issues, and similar matters.
Letters with the new leases will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase in rent of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18 a special window is opened at the customer service center for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting," respond, after briefly doubting, the workers who find themselves in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and former mining floors in Bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were already treated loud and clear by the Vice-President of Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change my fucking bathroom dish," the man mentioned in the introduction vents.
According to the workers, at the moment they come mostly retired to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half of the February rent discount.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" certainly does not manage to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," says the window clerk.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on rent, the matter must be settled by an independent judge.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed possible and completely in accordance with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
"No one is going to be judged here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man in the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court," he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so people may wait," he says.
Rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest four billion in apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be at most 7.50 CZK per square meter per month," it is indicated on the screen.
Only increase by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 kroner per square metre," says RPG.
In 2,600 floors, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not suddenly affect rents, but will scale from four to eight years.
In addition, he adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent rise (see the chart) back in the flats, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rent-up agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need day care
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with all the same to such facilities: colored walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design's employees can come to it.
Architectural projects company Arch.Design, from whose studio numerous known buildings of Brno emerged, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guard.
About 90 people work in the company, mainly in the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow the architects and liners to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, day care is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers to its workers within the framework of its social program.
The builders and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of the children.
The mini-guard was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-care centre is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (an amount of more than CZK 2.8 million) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified staff and services.
When funding runs out (two years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to keep the mini-guard running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the application for funding was submitted by Economy Rating.
The care of children is provided by qualified personnel; moreover, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present for their care throughout the day; the day-care centre currently accommodates children with no age limit, although most of them are under three years of age.
Since it is a "mini-guard", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the day-care centre is flexible in order to adapt to the needs of the parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the day-care centre, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is an individual education and care, the contents of the mini-care programme are comparable to the regular pre-school curriculum.
In it children not only play, but also receive a quality teaching: from basic learning to school readiness, they teach to English.
The class has not only toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up children from school late when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the companies that sign that they offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of personnel.
The house of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Look at Gaudí’s interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its skeleton-like shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of the scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all this is typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The house cover plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, we observe a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house seems even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
It snakes and the torsion of the forms continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the window frames, railings, door ornaments, peepholes and signs.
Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district at number 43 in the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, emerged from the refurbishment of a house from the year 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of various apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
Architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his plans of the project were created ornaments for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Milá and Gaudí's Güell Park, where other pieces of it are found.
Due to its organic shape, the premises shortly after its completion were nicknamed "the house of bones".
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawns".
It is also said that, on top of the construction, appears the sword of San Jorge, patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the central heating period with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
His forty - five - degree inclination may be strange.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect at all the construction standards of the moment and did not let himself be influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although clearly in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so impacted with the result that it asked to be corrected.
He was upset, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the city council's request, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can be communicated in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and skylights.
The play with the two colors brings the maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the rays of sun.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist card holders get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudí buildings into the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and the bed: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the somier.
First of all, they must be perfectly complemented in order for them to be adapted to specific users.
Numerous elements, including the owner's weight, height, state of health and sex, come into play during the election.
It is also important the type of interior in which the mattress and the somier are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they are "heated" more slowly.
In addition, they often weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the canals in the centre are not properly aerated and above are on a firm basis, they keep the moisture inside. Mold may even appear below.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower and tougher surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here."
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes who have long nervous system problems, so they get bad information about joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico brand."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes your stiffness and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not spin like after a hard match.
He just goes to sleep better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to your height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple standard to calculate the width: when lying down face up, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk towards your elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čalouník
In double rooms, each needs its own mattress and so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the boxes at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interiors a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeter are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you settle on the mattress, you should certainly not notice the docks," says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of spring.
The fully quilted bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash their holster, which is often done today.
And, since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a life-long guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of cleaning and washing the cover, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers are currently made with zip closures throughout their perimeter, so when they are opened they stay in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress may seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a somier, do you have a firm board?
Never!
At most for beds designed to spend one night visiting.
However, it should make (if you don't already have them) ventilation holes in the board and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulating sheet bedding containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although it is always better to use a bedding box with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar area are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Articulating sheet springs should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows pressing or even tilting the sheets in such a way that they "round" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "males", began to use a softer area precisely around their shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are soms with cross structure or tablets with the so-called multitorsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the right mattress and bedding, if you use a bad pillow (large and "soft"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that they can relax their muscles.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder spring or softer area of the mattress) as the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do, apparently, with the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to increasingly use natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, from which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, e.g. castor or soy.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soy.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the centre is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with vegetal breeze extracts, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the sheath.
The red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warmth.
The favorites these days?
Cold foam mattresses, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, make them more permeable than normal polyurethane mattresses and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold and viscoelastic foam allow the manufacture of mattresses from different areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have lower VAT, since they are considered to be sanitary means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and bedding.
Sometimes offers from manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory memory foam attached to the cover for 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
It initially emerged as material for NASA, because during take-off astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is used not only in mattresses, but also for sanitary devices, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents use people's tracking devices to control their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, to the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Anička and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We are all trying to tell us that it is not a matter of spying, but of another means of diminishing the chances of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the tracking device suppliers in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices may be abused, for example if they are put in someone's purse without their knowledge, but we have not yet come across such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns of the fact that, if the child does not want to carry him, he will simply throw him away.
"Even younger children show great creativity in intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"Before, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," says Bočková.
In his opinion, it is questionable whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check whether the child has any electronic device that can reveal his or her location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices spreads, you will also look for them, since their sale will certainly take place with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can be of help.
"The device can be configured to regularly send the position after a certain period."
"If he suffers damage, he will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices are equipped with an inclination meter, so if the person simply slips and remains motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In his view, such a service could be obtained even with mobile smartphones with navigation, on which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a size similar to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
They can therefore be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for that reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or to identify him after some time, which can make the police buy time," he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the verification of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough fuses to surround the whole of the Czech Republic, but it only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of fuse to ignite explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometers of fuse to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of the fuse is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosive fuse from the STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of fuse saying that soldiers need 60 kilometers of fuse a year for training maneuvers.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnics of the army, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, such maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives each year also all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
Neither Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr nor Army Captain Vlastimil Picek wanted exemption.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend sixty kilometers of fuse.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if that were the case, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of fuse, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so they limit even shooting practices for money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also fail to understand that we are repeatedly bought such quantities of fuse."
"But it's their decision, and they'll certainly know why they're acting like this."
"For us, the army is a good customer whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of fuse also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group indicates that the fuse has only a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, of two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
Upon completion of their useful life, each munition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of fuse, it obtained a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's 244-kilometer order," says spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence's shopping center.
Just to compare: the annual wick consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate World War II ammunition or that left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only for the right amount to exhaust the ammunition before the end of its useful life.
It was decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable wick types can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in completing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with which MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years there will be the following problem with the current one: we will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old fuse, which is now being bought "barata".
So far I'm still living off the contacts I got from the contest.
Winning the "Employer of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition, won the competition "Employer of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story looks like it's taken out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad, he realized that quality accommodation was needed at a good price in Liberec.
With the savings he brought together with seasonal overseas jobs and a bank credit he bought a house that was half ruined composed of five floors.
Considering he was still studying his third year at college, he was really brave.
"At present, the quality-price ratio of the accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began renting the first reconstructed floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested back in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in business, he managed to gradually open up in Liberec four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year it opened another one of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tise, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said businessman number one last year.
"This sale of hotel opening licenses was greatly helped by winning the 'Employer of the Year' contest," adds Pytloun gratefully.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends that everyone want to try some company that participates in the contest.
But he felt that it was not necessary to win, but that participation was already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live on contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started collaborating regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
in total about seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It is not, much less, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"It is only my name that appears on the front page," Lukáš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a year more peace of mind than we've ever had in Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may already have been through the worst.
Farmet owner Karel Árský received the first prize in the latest edition of Vodafone's "Company of the Year" contest, last year at the "Slav House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to convert a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition," says last year's winner.
The history of Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
So, when the state proposed Karel's father Árský to rent a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned from his position in the company where he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father from plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialist public after achieving success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers begin to consider the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value the collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Árský.
Last year maybe it wasn't just a sign of the euphoria of victory in Farmet.
It also gained recognition for the trade results up to 2008 and, partially, in 2009.
And precisely the year 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We obviously don't get rid of such a situation either."
"The revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs," explains Karel Árský.
A viable enterprise must sometimes even take unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet cut no spending was on research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained magnificent valuations at national fairs," says Árský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are rising again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Árský.
A Survey that Reveals Ridiculous Standards
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was made by more than one third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the business register, although its officials can obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the business register when it checks the insured's taxes," said ČSZZ spokesman Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the Absurdity survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it is the fourth time that it is part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and it is also beginning to create a hobby among the general public.
While last year's edition counted with the participation of 3,000 voters, this year it almost reached 4,000.
And it is not surprising, since we still have a number of legal obligations that must be respected simply in order to trade.
"Perhaps in the number of papers needed for tax returns we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments for years.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic ranks 74th, eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdez contest of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Win the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year's survey, more than one hundred were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
Examples were sent by businessmen, professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for road and motorway maintenance pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year's seventy proposals is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic, attended this event.
"Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state continually hinders entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in the water of drunkenness.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the employer's obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. communication to the labour office by its foreign workers of working trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is the charm.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their office a large mirror, a fridge and two floor scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had removed the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the contest of Hospodářské noviny is the category called Company responsible for the year 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone Company's 2010 main competition, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between them, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, for example, disabled persons are involved in other personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of the company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has already been the main funder for sponsoring disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery that is especially concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the workforce; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the contest Vodafone Company of the year ended up in third place in the region.
In Olomouc won the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities will have the least possible impact on the environment," explains businesswoman Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit of the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports the work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona in Distress grant, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the company's representative Ondřej Suchý.
The laundry company Praní a čištění from the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive special bonuses which have an impact on their pension funds, is also well placed with a mention.
"We give benefits in food, transport, skills improvement and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, from the construction company of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year all the regional finalists of the contest Vodafone Company of the year who answered the questions of the registration form and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
The organizers removed forms that were not complete or erroneous from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the contestants did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Company contest responsible for the year, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company contest of the year."
"Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, since it is a subcategory of the main Company of the year contest," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police made several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land was received by a precise interested party.
He had to pay Luboš G. half a million kroner for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribes during a public auction and public tender," Pilsen attorney general Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that she is currently unable to disclose further details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
How it could influence the public auction, given the limited official information, can only be speculated.
Agricultural Fund spokesperson Lubomira Černá answered Právo's questions saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and went during a public auction.
"This is a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called “Call for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the land law” and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a value higher than that of their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and, then, the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest offer," explained the Fund's spokesperson.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to run for the call and, since he is both interested because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to the interested parties in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for some time now.
He was in the case of the former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was charged with dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular where a large road to the Borská pole industrial area should be built.
Afterwards, he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself with a much higher value.
In this case, the municipality had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will be required to pay additional costs of several hundred kroner per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to take several hundred kroner a month more out of the portfolio from January than they do now.
The price of electricity rises by 4.6 per cent, gas by about 2 per cent, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10 per cent more for the water supply and many will also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 kroner a year more than it is now.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices, as support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaic, has increased.
However, gas is moderately expensive, especially at the time when heating is most used and therefore consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are expensive across the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the households of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an additional 50 kroner per month for central heating from January, while Liberec families will pay more than an additional 1,000 kroner per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, Praguens will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will increase by 7.4%.
The rental prices of 450,000 rented apartments in Prague can increase considerably, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, will increase rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will bring to court those who disagree with the new lease.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase next year to 10%.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer in the way, because it slowly works
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes them a long time to get drunk."
"Now fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," says Pravo, head of pediatrics at Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they get a bottle from their father from the cupboard, it may be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"Vote has the advantage of lightening with juice and not smelling so much," he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman for the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"It's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use spirits they picked up at home," adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikan, 13- and 14-year-old drinkers usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"It started at the age of 12, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, as well as a mixture with ecstasy," says the department's doctor on this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother was not surprised that his daughter disappeared 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest on the part of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, dependency cannot be properly referred to.
"Alcohol means a person who has been chronically dependent on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikan.
According to spokesperson Jurinová, forty drunk children were hospitalized this year at the pediatric clinic in Motol until mid-November.
However, statistics show only those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the travelling medical examination, go home to parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink spirits, there are three seasonal ups and downs for Pelikan: witch's day, New Year's Day and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"On witch's day I've come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at once," adds Pelikan.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and the nutrients missing from the body.
"These are doing much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and don't hurt at all."
"They are only confused about where they are," Pelikan says, adding that patients often lose their good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
The transfer by ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients cost about ten thousand crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when during the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend all summer in a youth job so that you would earn enough to pay yourself that night," Pelikan adds.
Health insurance, in his view, perhaps as a retrogressive measure, which often pays people back for treatment, does not do so for children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in the hands of others in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time such a device has been in the hands of anyone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for training or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seater.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the broker of the sale, Omnipol company, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peješk of the defense press department indicates that it is not yet known when Vodochody's aircraft will be physically withdrawn.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the aircraft repaired long ago, with no additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The two-seaters L-159T1 exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seater aircraft, as in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of SEK 200 million for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 two-seater devices.
One of the new planes was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS promised that the planes would be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve as pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this context," Pejšek points out.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense management states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24 aircraft, so it wants to sell the rest.
Buying Casa planes may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by issuing a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ring indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index to annular are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British cancer magazine.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to the age of 60," said co-author of the Ros Eeles study, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger may help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly if this characteristic is associated with genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as indicated by Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and simultaneously 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right-hand indica finger shorter than the ring finger.
They were as likely to have prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
For men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men with ages below 60 per cent the reduction reached 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "proved completely".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday covered with snow.
Roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and snow-ploughing machines circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between kilometres 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
At kilometre 91 a truck broke down, in 93 two commercial vehicles collided and injured.
Also several passenger cars ended up in the gutter.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at km 185 in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
Drivers must drive slowly after Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and join at kilometer 182 in Kývalce.
Stucks of several kilometers have been formed there.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow several centimeters and thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Stucks are forming in Prosek, for example, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně airport was closed from 11 p.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Currently, you can already travel on most of the roads of southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
Three secondary roads are closed in Vyškovska, snow tongues are being formed in Brněnska and chains are needed in Blanenska to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Milling machines will be required to clear them.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will open up to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region which, as a protected natural area, must simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, as indicated by ČTK.
In the Czech Republic they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfalls gradually subside in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals expect the new rifle to influence the local conflict with the Taliban and to "change the progress of the game" to make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise aim.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains cause it to actually function as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, wall or trench.
No doubt, normal protection cannot be used and, when you throw your murderous metal splinters rain, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the line of projection and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say 543 meters have been measured."
"When the trigger is pulled, the weapon is loaded and the projectile is thrown at a distance of 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette says.
400 jobs moved
Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad neighborhood of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will stay there.
The offer is highly attractive, in addition to the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday brought joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against it.
Frankfurt Chief of Economics Section Markus Frank (CDU) claimed that he has earned a "Global Player" by doing so.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site".
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the city earlier about his intention.
"We have naturally offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, the economic motives led to the fall.
In such a way, now there is a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of Marienbader Platz's surplus buildings for ten years of a controversial spa town construction project.
As a joint project of the city and of a private company of projects between the station and the city council is formed a new entrance to the city, that takes care of the criticism regarding the massive construction that previously used the spaces as parking spaces and regarding the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment consultancy and valuation companies, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, have been installed as well as then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu home computer manufacturer.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, originally from Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more businesses in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company named after TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Angst is increasingly taking over Wikileaks.
The Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Political pressure may be behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly detained in England.
Wikileaks' disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's list of wanted people, must remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks ejected from Amazon server."
"Speaking freely in the country of freedom," activists of the revelations communicated through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon services website in order to cope with the high numbers of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we will spend our dollars on hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, the CNN network reported according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The Senate council chair for the country's security had threatened Amazon with boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I had wished Amazon would take these steps earlier, prior to previous publications of information classified through Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous, and inconsiderate Wikileaks process puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world," stated in a statement by the independent senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with their service to extend stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's list of wanted persons.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has consistently described research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson stated in London that threats have existed.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange's safety is feared, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to North American statements.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, claimed that the person responsible for Wikileaks revelations must be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, an advisor to head of government Stephen Harper stated, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange a great dispute grows.
Robert Gibbs, U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman, called Assange's resignation "ridiculous and absurd," should she be responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website."
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed as an exceptional manager, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the major structural reforms", which are necessary in light of the Wikileaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The Ice Cream College
Ice cream parlors are prepared at the Gelato University in Bologna at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
From the gelatiere and the gelatium.
Gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The gelatium pulls out the ice cream cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the canister and sells it.
To know this, it is not necessary to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special more days courses on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk in the soft ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this California art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is an advisor to companies and wants to create something of her own in some years within an energizing job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream master Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants later the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only their good taste, but also their silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and so every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and come out a pasteurized white basic cream, the basis for all types of milk ice creams.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural or non-stalizer elements?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that they miss the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream "not just natural ingredients", perhaps has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar bean.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite an iced granite sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
Besides, there are powders and pastas.
"All suppliers will try to strain aromatized ingredients into their merchandise."
"Yet you must experience it sometime."
Be it with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now course participants can use the ice cream parlors.
Luciano lets them make each time four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
That tastes better does not necessarily depend on it having more aroma of tofe or more fruit puree.
Hazelnut ice cream does not need to taste like nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group elaborates the adored kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and somewhat less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the flavor of ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream making is a problem of artimetics: Peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano takes out an utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the types of fruit (measurement of the wine grower for Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately the tables facilitate the account.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
Not only does the utensil help in the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled at below zero temperature.
In spite of everything, all automation is left out as far as small pasta is concerned.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if he were an uncontrolled mini-first giant.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European food safety authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently being formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa's group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another expert from Efsa have also been employed for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortiums such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to Efsa's testing standards for genetically modified plants, placing it in a clear conflict of interest, then criticizes.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ilsi's situation and imitate the deed of the company, which is in fact controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
So, recently, a senior manager of Efsa went without the support or transition time to Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that her side.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were made by the General Environment Office as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided they are of high and technical quality, in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But you must expose these contacts.
Kuiper supports his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It is referred to as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
On this subject, independent experts, such as Then, criticize the fact that GM plants are currently allowed without researching animal food and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize makes in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how will they be found?" asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck is of the same opinion.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why few scientists are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not generally published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has gotten some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was standing at Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind his back.
There were demonstrations
It snowed.
The story is known: In September the bulldozers arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing lay rubble.
Broken at 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You mustn't disappear."
He gets excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
Like he once said, he smelled smoke from cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
You've bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonour, they would grind the gravel or send it to the dump," says a wooden house in his office that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the wreckage of the north wing from the demolition company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downing.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram dungeon cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
About half of it is still in the forest, the rest being sold long ago.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and above.
The Stuttgart stone of impulse has long become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political component."
He ascends to his SUV, makes a tour of his large kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And she's a rock lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the biggest ancient stone dealer in the country.
Slow down.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones chopped.
"They belonged to Dresden Marienbrücke Bridge," he explains.
Alba limestone, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Point out a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Beautiful travertine."
Formerly the Mazizos belonged to the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, toba of Heilbronner hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple rigging and a wagon, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to make the stone dealer, besides stonemakers, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a stained glass window and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the man who takes care of taking advantage of the remains.
He has to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones there to rescue.
Talent struggle around great potentials
There's an active influx in the buffet.
16 students gather around the buns, tomato soup and sweets.
Braunschweig Technical University and car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a sort of contest of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, gather in a hand-to-hand struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: To hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on their students' skills, attempts are made to capture and capture exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the project at Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium is won over by talent.
A lady in the personnel department hands out pens, gummies and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the enthusiastic young talents the internship programs and the works for students and shows them his ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University carries the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, observe interesting candidates more closely, and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
"The main point was previously in the technical projects," says Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies are no longer able to choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly skilled workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI) there were 40,000 vacant engineering positions in October.
And, according to VDI's prognostics, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a modern type of yincan, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinateds.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the start.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants goes to the US.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the mass."
"The simple journey alone was short for us."
For the Dykta talent scout the notes give results.
"Until today we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
"Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, above all, small and medium-sized companies, classic with their work fairs.
"We try to get students at specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, in charge of personnel for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacant posts appear on the company's website.
"It's being very difficult to fill the vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several colleges, for example the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that we can do internships with us or perform their theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: Personal environment, plain hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium cannot normally offer it," says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The key factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld holds 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in her ranking for her aspiring workers.
"I think the applicant is especially focused on the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
It advises its customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves," he says.
In the sector jargon is called Internal Employer Branding, also promoting corporate identity within the workforce itself.
"Satisfying employees are the best ambassadors."
When people are well treated and identified with the company, then promotion is obtained directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Perforations
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby overturned its previous plans in an unappealable manner.
Also on the Atlantic coast there are still further drillings forbidden for the time being.
This was announced by interior minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What prompted this strict ban, which will be in effect for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the US, President Barack Obama had admitted further drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
Until today it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable oil slick in the Gulf.
At the heart of criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil tanker consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
The responsible supervisory authority, which had been accused of corruption charges had now fallen into disrepute, was being reformed at the root.
Obama also announces that the lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be reduced thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by BDO - prior to Wednesday's extraction ban.
American Energey Alliance complains of insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new mining projects are continuing at an early stage, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water in the rivers is oil marrón, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live off the theft, corruption, and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine with that.
"Don't tire out," the environmental activist reassures reporters: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
You can't see brown oil stains floating on the surface.
Before here he took shrimp from handfuls, explains Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
Fish in the vicinity of the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach waters full of fish: That, in the heart of the Niger delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinky regions in the world.
On the way to the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown broth, which dips its hand in the water, will bring out a few full of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain they seek flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier of the outside is silenced, a sort of ghostly calm of an earlier paradise with smell of gas station expands in it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari, a hussy. "We live in constant danger to health."
War comparison should be made.
The area of the Ogoni settlement has been a battleground for years: Here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the oil employees.
Even today, companies are banned from returning to Ogoniland: While pumping more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters stood out steel platforms like strange water sculptures: "Christmas birds" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most have total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, so a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts' assessments, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the long-lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see the heads about to break and leak pipes as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally in the world conventional ones, reproached scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only the fault rates of the pipes are "about a multiple greater than elsewhere".
In one place, which seems forgotten from afar, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among the many barrels, which are sometimes linked to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire — a small illegal refinery — flames.
In the barrel, the oil heats in the fire longer hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, gasoline penetrates through pipes into the container, later the oil pipe drips and eventually comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-litre diesel daily: "It brings us 34,000 naira", around $22.
Delta dwellers take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel only 40 euros-centimate per litre illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which rigged the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million liters of oil are lost a day throughout the Niger delta.
Only an insignificant part of the stored provisional raw material is refined clearly illegally: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and high military officials also belong, keep the best part in reservoirs and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the loose way of production.
"If the oil companies did not act as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refining."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are especially shattered by Shell to the point that only one deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like the Chinese one."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's about time you disappeared," says muscular Ölmann.
"Soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special army unit catches illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, but with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
"This damned invention has completely shattered our country," says Akpobari.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, investigators found a possible factory defect, which can result in "catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus who made an emergency landing in early November were much luckier than you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s as a result of their investigations, and warned of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue or crack crack cracks can be caused, ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "catastrophic engine failure."
This affected engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among those is the Qantas-Airbus which had to make a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal measures against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court in Sydney that allowed for more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the early November incident.
At the engine mark they have lost parts and their wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from all over the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will perform further safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas apparatus, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines held approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily on land.
Lufthansa replenished the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double decked aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes chaos in traffic
Totally white Germany: It has snowed all over the country overnight.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter Ice Germany: Nearly all of the country reached freezing temperatures during Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic in many places.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snowblowers are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong wind gusts sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects live tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to Weather Service Meteormedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of newly fallen snow and cold and strong winds take care of swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities reported major disturbances in the streets.
In the A2, snow and wind paralysed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia the snowfalls affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, trees fallen on the lanes or the broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop his trip to Munich.
Firefighters and rescue service served all 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
Winds with snow sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesperson for Fraport there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The snowblowers are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
On many streets, Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker died in a collision with a train at a track crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a track junction because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after turning her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become softer and dusty and will therefore swirl in soft gusts.
But the wind will slow down.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to one article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank arranged its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in Frankfurt's bank district; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of reonvation, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims based on a spokesperson.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the project sale.
"We always check to see if we should own the properties or sell them and then re-rent them," he said.
That is why Germany’s largest credit institution is again resigning from its company’s headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a house fund and then made the necessary arrangements.
Energy reforms reached a figure of approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
If the renovated buildings are sold at a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been revealed at present, the spokesman said.
Thousands of mourners for the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were presumed dead after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Nearly two weeks ago an intense explosion took place in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced into the place of misfortune, but it discovered no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue team was able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, family members and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the glowing sunshine at Greymouth on the southern New Zealand island.
They're silent for two minutes.
In homage to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under garments and surfboards.
Flags waved to half-mast in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand waited for miners to return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, Lawrie Drew said, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the island of southern New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to fall, Gary Knowles, the police superior, told reporters.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does the gore fit into artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn once again explores the boundaries of the genre with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience will Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought about when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators who seek bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and rip their enemies' guts out of their bodies alive when they are in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it's actually called, doesn't say almost any words throughout the film and the other characters get carried away by at most one or two phrases or a couple of grieving deadly screams.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the racks offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for filmmakers grown up and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several target groups it is a shame that they cannot be dismissed from each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the "Pusher" drug dealer hairstyle as some kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with some more humor in the mainstream or somewhat less brutality of the art house.
A brain mass and burrowing guts cannot deter most fans of art cinema.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Cristion missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shuts up again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, a piece of sometimes exciting cinema is hidden, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is condemned just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy trance soundtrack make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a little blond young man, who supports Unojo faithfully, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents doom, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the midnight of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometres away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it deals with a reactor that the Syrians reportedly built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley leaving the river.
According to information from the CIA's international intelligence service of late April 2008, an ordinary reactor was designed under the name of the proximity of el-Kibar very suitable for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique serves little purpose other than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the interior.
The reactor had been in operation for a short time, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely better known than at the time, the enigmas grew older over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but that he saw little indication that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, a number of secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and talk only about a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack solid evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat responded in summer in a stoning manner that the IAEA has "sufficient material to have questions."
The Syrians very quickly disposed of the rubble of the alleged "unusable military building" and thoroughly paved the ground.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium scraps in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by individuals.
In addition, IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, of commercial vendors at the time just after the attack, which must have a greater information value than the CIA had presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, purchased them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after particle analyses.
Since then Damaskus has refused to discuss this issue, as well as satellite imagery.
In addition, controllers are prohibited from a second inspection at el-Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel, too, remains strictly silent.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and “has progressively become a serious credibility problem for the authorities”, as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place at the IAEA in Vienna, a serious violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, which is under IAEA supervision, is finally pending.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have so far not made public what teams are involved, what functions they have, or whether they appear to be suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as internees, again derived from the proximity of the cities in question.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, Isis, identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite imagery, most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located at or immediately beside a military base, Syria prohibits the entry of the three sites to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that Syrians fear a record that the US has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert about the teams thanks to U.S. secret service warnings.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has indications that material is transferred between the three locations and the cube to the Euphrates shore.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna claimed that at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production."
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or refurbishment; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargoes disappeared from the ground trucks, no one has information on where the debris remains.
IEAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located in the few kilometres from El-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as an area for radioactive waste, unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in a satellite imagery analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that Syrians made land movements in the three suspected locations and disposed of large containers after IAEA requested entry.
It may be by chance, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that IAEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, that Syrians allow, to maintain the possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
Meanwhile, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, uses the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who is to propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitant.
This path is very risky: this requires the majority of the IAEA governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: "And what if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Times of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the address of her still unnamed debut.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have protested quickly, which at the last minute moved some planned filming days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She is not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
No love stories are given in rape camps, and Jolie's position on the subject betrays the victims enough about the script.
Her organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended the removal of Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, after a strip and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she enters the Yugoslav conflict with great effort, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains vague.
On the net a second synopsis of the film circulates that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosniac, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim falls in love with torturer".
It is certain that Jolie's film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here.
It's finally good for the Irish again this afternoon.
No sign of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans shout for joy as the music rumbles loudly, they hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the South African Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus some plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this bizarre drinking game and the discreet computer doesn't really make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, distracting himself from the fulminant question, what the future will hold for him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "he got the job of his dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, her brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in Londrés.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like that of the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, forecast economics experts and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin.
As of 2015 there are 200,000 emigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migratory wave comparable to that suffered by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, today the melancholy spreads.
The economic crisis particularly confuses young, well-trained Irish people, for whom so far, everything is uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, complaining that: "In Ireland everything is sinking."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it a whole generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union sees a bleak future emerge because the government is only engaged in montages and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they don't have strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
Observe how his companions range from unresumed practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "Working AbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to run your career," says the manager.
On his website are photos of one boy surfing in Australia and another one snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in galleys, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now they're setting up a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he went to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only rarely because he works overtime to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as long ago he stepped on the threshold of his home.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with carefully landscaped gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid of failing credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children I have to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he hears often today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's already worked for a couple of years in London, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend in New Zealand do well?
But in these days there is one thing he is very concerned about: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid he might degenerate into a farewell party.
"Only, not too much emotion," he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Goodbye, it sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies, continues to increase.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows monitoring of changes in attitude in the region.
The results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively mood prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see figure 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (figure 3).
About 34 per cent stated that they trusted their country ' s Congress and 45 per cent their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but significantly higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty was only marginally increasing in 2009 and has fallen again this year to 32 per cent.)
However, mood varies considerably from country to country (see figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since the polls began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see figure 5).
Some 31 per cent claim that, whether they or a close relative, they have been the victims of crime in the past year, a figure that has fallen from 38 per cent last year and is the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of those surveyed in Venezuela are of the same opinion (and 80% support private companies), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (nine per cent, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (nine per cent compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Garbage elections
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they did go far worse than foreigners who tried to help the country go back after its problems feared.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the sewers, polling stations destroyed and acts of intimidation.
The polling stations opened hours late.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to find out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that it was "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community stated, with caution, that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and to his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tiebreaker is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for the elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former First Lady, have withdrawn their initial petition requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if any, has moved on to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is raging the country and more than a million earthquake survivors continue to live in tents, a large abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
Some 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors see the election of a legitimate people's government as an essential step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And, as it has become clear, so do the Haitians themselves.
Pushing tiptoe toward the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, she has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level that she has recorded since her election in 2007.
In spite of everything, that she can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued fiscal revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the extra income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following the death of Kirchner due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply next year, which will offer the president an even greater scope for action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but many private estimates, in addition to the wage demands of trade unions, place it at around 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and caused the INDEC, the statistical institute, to adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now moderate these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its officials claim that they want to limit salary increases next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a forced pre-restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the prelude to cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to remain in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband at her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has become tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have declined.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, quietly, many of your husband's policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother across the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, came on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what seems to be a comprehensive assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become an advocate of feelings for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest changes in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but nearly.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to get the majority of the vote.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has been inclined towards full independence from Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential ones, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's voting share has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the city halls.
In the election you could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with banderitas and light girls dancing clothes.
Nor did the mysterious attempt of rigorous murder fail.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or to take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the shooting affected the election, sowing suspicions about the PDP and causing voters to lean for the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not addressed.
Instead, the candidates discussed public accommodation and job creation schemes.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoids publicizing its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PDP also avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma stated that it had been confirmed that his policy towards China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but first things first.
It is best to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to pass.
In any case, the PDP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PDP is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been welcomed as a PDP candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything it can to prove that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PDP and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen intervening, the PDP will have difficulty choosing from among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also conduct an examination of conscience.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems mainly to be due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson claims he will restructure his cabinet as well as local teams.
Large PDP samples suggest Taiwan's support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys' surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the Best Artist Revelation category.
Considering that Spalding has been a acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the Grammys' rules that he must be an artist who has not released more than three albums to the market before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly made a breakthrough and, taking into account his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop influences, funk and Latin rhythms, one can at least make a distinction between Spalding and the road to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have recently focused on the jazz arena for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of last year's favorites.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite strident in New Orleans and regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans considerably towards fusion as on Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy's wild punk James Argue's Secret Society earned well-deserved recognition in the big group category, competing against Billy Childs Ensemble's great camera jazz and the ever-dangerous Dave Holland, whose live album with his byte, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in Best Classical Album Direction
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a play for three-movement eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed into thirteen categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner by the Symphonys No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the Mariinsky Theatre orchestra and choir; and Arthur Sullivan for "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, of approximately 30 minutes, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for her to play in mandolin Avi Avital, which performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral function category, for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists nominated include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the ordering commission
The mosque project for Temecula has gained the unanimous support of the local ordering commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and jams.
However, the members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be impressive from the aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha'is, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud of myself."
"Prove justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loudly."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at six in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time it was dedicated to people who interceded for or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"The United States no longer exists," reads one of the comments.
"It's another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand".
"America Has Fallen".
Plans to build Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmonush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has lived together for years smoothly in Riverside County, but he wanted more and better space than the warehouse he rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
A arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"Can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, although it lacks little to be a truly 'alien' type of life form," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in Thursday's online edition of the publication Science.
There have long been considered to be six major life-critical elements: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have found that bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, at which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated widespread speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "if it shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the investigation team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element by another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus".
"Consequently, it may be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, to put it another way, it puts the biochemical machinery on its back," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that there may naturally exist a way of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example had never been found to prove that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth ages, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there might be other ways to generate life, not just the way life was formed on Earth formerly," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health.
Stolen dogs missing in Compton have been found.
The two missing dogs of the four stolen dogs have been found in front of the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers claimed on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which they were spending the night, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, according to authorities.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met Wednesday, late at night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They're back with their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is under way".
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found for comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the area competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were to be shown in other competitions planned for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, as Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's nearly two-month tour taking part in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their room window.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer pup, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and they would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen Tuesday at 6:00 in the morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, endowed with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while MGM restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally got the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-prepared" plan by creditors to clear approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and release of films and television programs.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the demands of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to regress under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In reality, MGM will not come out of Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument, to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicated the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to give advice on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in recovery from bankrupt companies, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the study's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
Prior to spring this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was eventually backed by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will obtain a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been collecting $375,000 per month for their company management services, will receive a "successful honorarium" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production on MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and collected an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to make a separate loan of between $265 and $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of its gift budget
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy of this year, followed perhaps by the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in its gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings adorned with beads, or approximately 48 Play-Doh cans.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been working; this year's tech toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button battery-powered toys are increasing, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are teddy toys the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when they squeeze their belly.
A grip equals a note, and a second grip begins to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start tightening, you can't stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Borrowing from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-shift games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative wheeled articulated feet with locking device.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you are an 80s child, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question letters designed to turn a car ride into a session with an actual self-correction exercise notebook.
If you are suspicious of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years), it is the first major set-up of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, 3 to 7 years) uses an iTunes-type system to present games and ebooks, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks just larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to assemble words by placing the blocks in a row before the time runs out; it is formidable for an improvised word-assembly competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy shops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online mascot at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, from 6 to 12 years old) which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristles of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of button-powered microbots.
The false insect moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
Promotion of a more moderate side of order maintenance in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous persons in his charge, issuing orders quietly with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the heavy police of China's urban order, feared and despised by their energetic whimsical measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Signature!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "How beautiful girls are!"
Four girls who barely spent their teens wearing white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to attract attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with bows with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they look normal," Mr Tang said, scornfully.
"Models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color from uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a messy snack cart, and observed him frowning constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically elected for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's minimal respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat to death a passerby after using his cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how to effectively whip criminals without causing them to bleed.
This year, a traveling Shanghai watermelon salesman suffered brain damage after a brawl with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for online download, features Chinese trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleaning."
Skeptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They were to have a height above average, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over 25.
"His image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the candidates' external qualities will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
Women's Chengguans are like vases, he said, and added, "in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to back that description.
But he noted that height demands were standard in many Chinese work notices for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not appear.
"We can't let a person fuck or humpback come to work here," Mr.Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with her red cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His dimpled co-worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
They are also not opposed to their work on time, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply driving out vendors in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces roughly a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu rolls or bowls as possible before they are thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman ran off on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn car with noodle trimmings.
The officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his hours off.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the sellers' merchandise.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after the false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had murdered a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan policemen or officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Only two streets away from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike shouted rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, made way for the elbows to their vehicles and left quickly with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squadron, remained behind, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr.Li said with total naturalness.
"Most of the time it's the public that starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not press charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced Wednesday that DOJ prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work by lobbying for the wife's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat faced by Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he was "surely pleased" with the decision, which came after an entire year's investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plan to bring charges against him for this issue."
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, email, and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, get lucrative work by lobbying, to achieve Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law from lobbying for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the status stirring door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks to its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens, amid charges of procedural misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's main lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a DOJ prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in attempting to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was just a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a job by lobbying thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "mashing" the Ministry of the Interior on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator expected the ethics committee to quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign wishes to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, reports of the horrific testimony were sent via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, is ready to reach an official final, with the judge imposing the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have filed briefs in court outlining the arguments for appeals that they will likely occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports on the process, including widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere," and such widespread and immediate saturation with exalting details caused public passions to exert inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appellate judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
First instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was led by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the appellate courts have recognized that the coverage of successful cases can generate questions about the fairness of a process.
In a 1966 landmark ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general cause for concern about the impact of the new media" on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtrooms could make trials more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes' lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy pictures of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
Juries weren't kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of intense process coverage may attract most of the interest.
They observed in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continuously fueled the fire of emotion over the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse," lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state."
Your attention on Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly, was a ludicrous view that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future trials.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal were often attracted to arguments about the adaptation that was required in the courts because of social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their brief, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturns Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to the coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents 21st century Sheppard vs. Maxwell case".
Can civics draw a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invectiveness and negativity, a little civicism has been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it an omen of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to party fighting in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no progress on the major issues that should be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what they all say, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to gain partisan points.
The Wednesday public meeting of the president's deficit commission was equally civilized, despite the remaining political differences among members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Now both sides are in a trial period, surveying each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent evaluations of it by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and deeply rooted to suggest any rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, expenditure, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite ends.
However, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make them believe they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, denying unemployment benefit for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to a continuing bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
"After the things to be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civics can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012," he said.
The motives have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and overturn the new health law.
These lines of support are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the reduction of expenditure.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult work in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials in the panel, suggesting that in tax matters there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for commitment.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House Republicans and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama about the budget, taxes, and medical care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would bring about the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a deadlock, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch people's reaction carefully.
Whoever they think is losing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partidism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans of Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked American document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracy," and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money that it collects directly from the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority," takes its part as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup ever since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have systematically denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several lawsuits for libel over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, a hoax, a nuisance."
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that it is diplomats from a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with criminality have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to claim that the government functions more like a cleptocracy than as a government," the note states.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and mafia that literally means 'ceiling' or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
" Analysts identify three-tier structure in Moscow criminal world".
"Luzhkov is at the top".
"FSS, MVD and militia are on second level".
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level".
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, "explained that Moscow's commercial owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, the protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
On a national scale, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked at least at the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US Embassy's note, which did not occur late at night Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure, and, you know, done in such an immoral way."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to face the past
In a concrete classroom weakly lit, with stained and shelled walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalled the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Khmers.
"Here Everybody Loves Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader and cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the rule of the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this remote former fort of the Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the story of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations/Cambodia court issued the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing former head of the well-known torture centre Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among veterans of Anlong Veng's Khmer Rouge, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among former Khmer Rouge, but they can do nothing," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is creating divisions within families."
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest fighters of the Khmer Rouge fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Khmer Rouge elite officials retained their local administrative positions in exchange for laying down their weapons, the plain soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have gained few benefits after the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the regime's utopian agrarian ideology".
"They were raised without any concept to do business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge when she was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting herself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone".
"But now life is difficult because we have to self-supply."
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve much to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent embarrassing afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden piles on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to speak of his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She claimed that if the court called her, she would not appear.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question him.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to move forward, Chhang Youk of the documentation centre said.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is reuniting the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", 75 pages.
It was distributed at Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's secondary school history textbook, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's link with the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the edge of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last break, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas hoping to have good luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's worldwide campaign to protect nuclear material, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will renounce its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the margins of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations were conducted with Belarus in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to one official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the issue.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-qualified uranium) and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials claimed that the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said he was loaded on a special train that traveled over 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by plane.
The US government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the installation of low-enrichment uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was very carefully coordinated and orchestrated to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for armaments, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reservation by 2012, according to the joint declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential detente.
It was stated that "while progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not object to CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading for Guantánamo via Spanish territory, the US ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice president of the government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked the Spanish Executive to be informed in order "to be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance over foreign planes crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting took place between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to intelligence flights across Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" in order to avoid being "unsuspectingly fucked," Aguirre relates on a cable.
Also the then head of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this issue the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence."
For his part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors," rather than the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre laments.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and the interior minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, told him that "although Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government," he says.
The parricida confessed to complaining about being a mother in the network of the "overwhelming"
The young woman talked about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" online.
With this nickname, which she employs as a child, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the town of Coruñas from which she is born.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician woman, aged 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, soon it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get the DNA test.
It wasn't long before another courtship met him.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, neighboring municipality.
With him he came to live together for a long period.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But from the contents of the communications, it is seen that their romance was fractured, that they broke up.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca alone and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry, because I have come to work."
"When I told him it seemed good, but of course, now he realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not be free to do whatever he wants."

Populars would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP has already looked at the general elections because, whether they are advancing or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes this formation obtains in those elections usually double that received in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics, the figure rose to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could move from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would stay with one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate meeting will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its replacement at the head of the Diputación de Barcelona, one of the administrations that handles the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not get a majority or possibility to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be foolish for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they will be able to take the lead in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
The popular have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians detained by officers of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including “Tigres for the Liberation of Tamil Land” (LTTE) and “Laskar e Taiba” (Let), the latter author of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "operation Kampai" Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus at the international level has been "weakened" and, therefore, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that make up the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The uncovered cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had in operation in Europe, hence the fact that in addition to the Thai services, other European police units have participated in the investigations, so it is not ruled out that in the EU territory similar blows to the one carried out last Tuesday night in Barcelona will be carried out in the next few days.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another one developed in Thailand with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who ran the cell from Bangkok in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents were to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
The investigation revealed that, for the time being, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the stolen passports in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that days before this attack was committed, some $1,000 was sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that was "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized a wealth of documentation.
The PP demands More to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to dispense with philo-sovereignist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to propose in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans came to the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that she has obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make herself wanted, because the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the investiture vote.
The future alliances that nationalists want to have in Congress when general elections are held depend on a possible understanding with the PP, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has with the rest of the political leaders are done in Catalan code.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investiture "it will be necessary to park all the sovereignist and independentist speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends to even submit to referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of inheritance and donation taxes.
Details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric states that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their keeper killed more than 11 elderly people
The leaders of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while he was there employed killed at least eleven elderly people he was in charge of.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, attorney Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's wish would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the person responsible" for the deaths but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil perpetrators".
In addition to the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the warden in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' relatives are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has since continued to kill.
The judge already pointed out in the order ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was sent by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, yesterday flatly denied this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is not a single indication in the case that there has been a reckless action on the part of anyone other than the accused himself."
The already named "Angel of Death" confessed yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 for, a month and a half later, to kill a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by pricking him with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed by helping him with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to the drugs.
The insulin punctures and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the tests being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, if she burned them inside giving them bleach as she has already confessed that she did with the three women she killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the statements of the warden, not even to the number of murders confessed, which do not rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say they are brought to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's yesterday threat warning "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Peripheral differentials have closed hard and European banks' shares have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely picked up which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses recovers but is motivated by the closing of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose his fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to be withdrawn tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan as ineffective and eliminate all extraordinary term liquidity measures and leave only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond buying program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still oblivious to withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As at their May meeting at which they claimed that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed markets, history could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the one-year letter auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment following Trichet's words.
In Ireland, figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland Hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension in the face of the forthcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Banco de España has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Help Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available than triple that in March, at extremely expensive rates and closes you access to markets sine die.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being so, seeming so."
Cheer up, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm does not subside in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "full-fledged clause", the judicial board of El Enebro on the 16th, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for control on the part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to give in in his litigation to be present at the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From its board of directors it was debarred by five of its seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly on January 18 of this year and whose challenge is noted in the Mercantile Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next 16th, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunders within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants their five children to, through procedural argument, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null meeting of January 18", according to their official spokesmen.
This argumentation will be the basis for the Board, once held, to proceed to its challenge by considering it to be "full nullity".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried to have the magistrate convene a board in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, however, the usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This case is the substantive matter to be decided by the judge after the hearing on the application for challenge, for which there is still no date.
Red Bull triumphs at F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
A software designs improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship everyone opted for the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without underestimating the ability as a driver of the finally champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far away from the high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains for manufacturing factories worldwide, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding faults and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the fire engines.
Siemens' manager explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's fire engines with the exception of the engine, which is entirely Renault's responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this technological improvement madness is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its fireballs in a locality about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The squad for this task amounts to 580 people, including their two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula One hero is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy beverage brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety is zero.
The factory's head of technology, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R & D advances in cart cars contributed 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive shop in collaboration are its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will match this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP España, Helena Herrero, gave an example of the remodeled shop located in Gran Vía Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the third being in Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is in charge of the exclusive furniture design of the shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims "to improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The store in Barcelona includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connects to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially rules out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
However, it foresees a collapse of interest margins, which will be partly offset by increases in commission and credit prices.
Sabadell hopes to attract in three years a million private clients, his outstanding subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The objective, in addition to surviving without having to resort to FROB's public aid, is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if they are counted as those who can leave the bank - their major outstanding subject, since until now they have pampered SMEs and companies more than retail customers.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks today dare to set targets and make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its Optima master plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation made it expand one more exercise.
Customers who let the savings banks escape will be their main target.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, while he believes that the liability war - which penalises margins - is falling, the price of the risk premiums that banks and banks are paying for their issuances to obtain liquidity are already moving to the credit price to compensate for the drop in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave Thursday orders to his network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of the spreads - see CincoDays of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now "is to raise commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "larger sizes will be required."
"Next year is going to move everything," he said.
He claims that capital needs are "highly high" and does not rule out any Spanish financial institution entering into red numbers.
He points out that FROB can supply the market in raising funds in the face of new recapitalisations.
Having ensured that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it played down what some bankers are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through repos, which dampens the crisis.
ECSC rules out second wave of mergers in the banks
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that there would be a wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When it started the process of concentration of Spanish savings banks, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and protected by the Banco de España, which has collaborated a lot in this too," said the director.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the process of concentration is going on "at the greatest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the deadlines that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Banco de España", he emphasized.
"Passing from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion asset volumes to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to meet Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Banco de España does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The director said that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has embarked on a process of "very important" concentration and that "goes at the fastest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well off from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed people without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How do you interpret these movements?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the recovery of the framework, although it now seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the offending countries, possible suspensions of payments from some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government took a constitutional reform out of hand to prevent them from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front line was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully lengthened Greece's rescue decision.
Already then it was subjected to fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties, in order to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should be attending the process of reform of the Union that will make possible those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it will not cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which he may not agree very much, the old operation of the euro will be over from that date.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves in default of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
It is not just a question of bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater calm.
And let's take advantage of the window of opportunity we've been given, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood it this way and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the thesis that we have to put order at home has opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn't seem to be moving.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, the possibility of leaving a monetary area too crowded with unserious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and law fraud
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not willingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly planned by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match contested on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behavior is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the match (which his team had clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in taking down faults to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will finish as leader of his group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned with two games the team's coach, José Mourinho, and with different financial amounts the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that has arisen in the case reported is because it has been starred by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem presumes of nobility and honor, and which on past occasions has fined its players for analogous acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulations contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit fraud of law; for, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sports regulations, but seem to circumvent their meaning.
The question is what kind of damage they cause to the sporty spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these assets that are alluded to with fair play is to prevent the offending players' team from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
Now, the paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is that they did not conform to what we normally characterize as a trap or law fraud, because their violation of the rules was not made in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely their action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They looked forward to and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage offenders gain from intentional misdemeanours examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the opponent is not put in a disadvantageous position nor is profit obtained in the same game, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that may threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminateness, since the team can be eliminated at the first of change, and also with this performance the players fulfill a penalty match and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension due to card accumulation occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not run counter to the sporting spirit, of which it is a part, to make strategic decisions in favour of making the most of what the rules allow.
In the case at hand, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without circumventing the punishment or running away from it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law fraud is blurred, on this occasion I believe it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture group Christmas dinners at BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
The self-suffered celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, proliferate.
Like the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners prior to Christmas, which continue to exercise as an oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority client: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed coincide.
To finish complicating accounting, this year's calendar (as New Year's Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated petitions in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has already happened since 2008, when the skinny cow stage began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners on budgetary grounds.
In order not to dispense with tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employers, to this day, does not dare to predict what the celebrations of this month will be like.
"People think about it a lot before booking."
"He wants to leave but has the alerts on the issue of prices," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to lower a step with the crisis, so that the strip around 25 euros has become majority in demand.
A survey in various central establishments shows the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is a real boom of applications for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros", they detail.
At AN Grup, which flag El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 venues, remain optimistic after detecting a boom in turnover from the second semester and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends that precelebrate the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added one Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the employers' association Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reserves are "animated", although the clients "business to the maximum".
However, the illusion for the celebrations has not descended, pay whoever pays, it indicates.
Pakistan’s Nuclear Program Raises Serious Concern in the US · Global Voices
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks leaks confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns raised in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on atomic security, rather than increasing, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for development in Washington.
This is listed by the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersal of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep watch.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with his American counterparts.
The latest in the documentation leaked by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani rate of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which calls communication with Pakistan "frustrating", argues: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of help are left unanswered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the person responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks chief
Obama appoints a senior head of the anti-terrorist struggle to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow Assange's movements."
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it's not about the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents, but about the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks creator Mark Stephens' lawyer says that "police know where and how to get in touch with Mr Assange."
It was on the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as the organization has explained, do consider the so-called network notice free way to proceed to an arrest -- which the national police force must undertake -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, has been willing to respond via video conference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with Stalin's mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange remains unaccounted for, but not silent.
On Monday he granted an interview from an indeterminate location to the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign," he said.
His opinion was denoted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation petition "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," she told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist fighter, Russell Travers, to prevent further document leaks.
President Barack Obama's attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue anyone who gives them any contribution or help."
Further still has gone Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying Assange should "be killed".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor and possible presidential candidate.
"Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he said on the Fox network.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks to those related to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret ballot on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to circumvent the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his resignation is insufficient for those related to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as its own mentor and that it can not cause him the headbreaks he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councillors of ERC will be able to pronounce on its continuity in secret.
By ballot, and not by show of hands.
If the carodists want to vehicular a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do it without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian one" would not be good either.
The next to Carod demand from the president something more than putting his position at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But as they do not have enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map between now and May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which the management will put to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to advance the congress to autumn 2011, something that the leadership already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" harms stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, capable of washing dirty rags from doors inside.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the acting conseller Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació assumed that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e. to include new faces coming from the Carod-like sector.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC once and for all liquidate assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes to allow the congresses to be held through elected delegates.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which already fought in this regard at the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave convulse of 2008 left the commission to the management to review the assembly at a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years had discouraged us from dealing with the matter.
Now, without sectors critical of stalking, it can be a good time to pick it up and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the MILENIO State of Mexico, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the context of MILENIO State of Mexico.

In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the forehead was found the corpse of a man on a lonely road of the Colonia El Naranjo and under the body they found a percuted shell of a 25 caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán alerted about the discovery of a corpse in the Peña Colorada spot, which was tied hands backwards and with a blindfolded head.
The man had a gunshot wound to his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men was reported, who were wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda division in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.

In Ixtapaluca, with gunfire fired on the back of the head, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
In the skin of the woman tattoos of the Holy Death were detected, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the latter part of the month, the body of a man in the municipality of Zinacantepec was found aboard a car with at least three bullet hits and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with their heads wrapped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied hands and feet, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the colony Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him the agents found a card with a message.
China Maintains Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, a representative of that country at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country had invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He said that China ' s climate change strategy was divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the adoption, last year, of a new Energy Law, which reflects the objectives set in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, several multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by Governments of other countries, are under way or have already been completed.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for the change of incandescent hotbeds by savers and one for mitigation and adaptation, he elaborated.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific advisor to the government of that country on climate change, said that China's efforts have been greater than those generally thought.
For example, he said, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution in pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do the same by 2020, it abounded.
Attached to the Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The PAN national leader detailed that the former PAN leader has the right to go to the National Order Commission to claim whatever his right is right.
The PAN's national leader, César Nava Vázquez, said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was in accordance with the law and that the former PAN leader has the right to go to the National Order Commission to demand what is in his right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's taking of protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has his right to appeal, if any, to the National Council's Order Commission, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the framework of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional will be strengthened from the internal election on December 4 and 5, when his successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The PAN leader said that 71 years of dialogue support the PAN, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; the contario "we enjoy it and strengthen us," he said.
He said the council will certainly be able to choose the best or best leader that National Action requires for the next three years, hence he will hand over the stafeta "to whomever the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the party president's office."
He predicted that the upturn the party registered in the last July 4 elections will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it is not yet time to think in 2012."
"For now it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to expectations."
When questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of the four years of his government, César Nava called on the PRI to reflect on the sexenions of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; that they start defending them; that they come out of the closet," he said.
He believed that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no gag or much less censorship in the country.
Obama Promotes Law on Twitter for Undocumented Students
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation," tweeted the U.S. president on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyberlink with a broader document that asks the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected to occur soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other bills such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a "closing vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on as of next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before age 16, have remained in the country for the past five years, and have joined a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the competition of a handful of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations are actively lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However at least one of them, Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, Dream Act supporters need to join several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who completed Senator Mel Martinez' term.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have stated that they will not support it another time.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where participants demonstrated the narrative
"That sex in the tongue I understand but... the finger in the wound? what is expected of me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "puts us in trouble," the Argentine writer sweetly urged the public, mostly young people, who met at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "llaga" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get answers although she does have clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist he is convinced: "patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very entertaining.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative entitled Elogio de la inventación, where the finger on the sore is not named but is discovered at one point.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, she tells of a famous sorcerer, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a story that she turned to speak later America, the great novel that her own chroniclers had not lacked from the beginning to tell it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that he lacked to modesty."
However, he emphasized "it is the madmen and the liars who imagine best" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that the narrative belongs to one side or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
He actually calls it the "cervantine tradition."
"By his inheritance we are what is told."
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero outlined and applauded the variety of interpretations that gave rise to the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger on the sore.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican woman pointed hers towards the great scourge of the social violence that her country is going through - and she shares Latin America - as a result of the drug trafficking and sale disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, after quoting that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To own our thinking and own reality we have to nuance: and nuance means many times putting your finger on the sore and bothering those people who are much more comfortable thinking of cartoon, black and white, established ideas and no nuance and also bothering the powers who prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting himself with the medal of the runner-up, he has stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the Apertura 2002 Tournament, when he held the reins of the Morelia with which he fell by 4-2 overall to Toluca; subsequently, in the 2003 Clausura he also reached the decisive duel and also lost him to 3-1 global and went precisely to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again before the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team ended up tied 2–2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the set of pénaltis he put himself in advantage by 3–1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three players of his failed from 11 steps and suffered the 4–3 flip.
Rubén already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore he does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to get out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," the helmsman commented when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very valid has the previous final, from which, he assures, he has learned a lot, "the only teaching that we can have is that until the referee whistles the final we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the previous time, with two penalty to throw we were already prepared to run out and I think that is a teaching, until the game is finished we can celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty shots, something that does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the batch of penalties, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad move fate, sometimes because of the nerves or anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it left us, that left something for this end that we hope does not reach that instance".
Romano has in his hands to stop being a technical runner-up and for the first time prove the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules to obtain visa
People should go to Visa Applicants Service Centers before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to Visa Applicants Service Centers (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for application visa cases (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for commercial and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in the Consular Section for less time than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will release tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the one in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA said it will present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures at our par and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put at the table the possibility of them becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently it is a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and from this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "if there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know".
The space agency will release the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon on Saturn), with the prospect that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Opposition 'block' Pattern
With reforms to the Congressional Organic Law, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by PRD deputies, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'throned' against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it begins the 'bipartisanism', because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the PANista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He explained that in the next few days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be crushed again by both parties and with it the opposition coalition is over.
"So far it has come (the opposition coalition), it is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress after having been monopolistic, is now "doopolic."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipatidism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently Congress became a 'boot' between two, in alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're splitting it between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked that the personality of the deputy be respected, that he be given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by cupular agreements, let 5 be left out that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, right now the five that see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify ourselves to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform they made that they agreed to, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more goes for "the supplier."
Mazatlan City Council pays another check to the questioned owner of electrical equipment company.
One more check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical material company, amounts to 1.2 million pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior State Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still due to him and, therefore, how many more cheques remain to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you are simply being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two from October 15, October 19, October 29, and the latter from November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as stated in the Law when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid more than 10 million pesos by the Municipality, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he cashed cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to attend tourist sites
They regret tourist businessmen accident of foreign tourist due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination be taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and the sidewalks has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and take the return to the nearby businesses.
"Politics don't know what it's like to close a company one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, or else they didn't do the works this way in so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so by providing preventive maintenance and not just falling into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only for being a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venadito of Mazatlan.
"Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are tourist attractions," he said.
"The proper attention has not been given and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of Mazatlan tourist sites is urgent, as they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that must be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive to be added in the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Asks Congress for IP results
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CEC, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A law of decent work and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
From yesterday, the 60th legislature was installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 PAN deputies, three New Alliance Party members, two PRD members, one PT member, one Convergence member and one PVEM member, with a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly inaugurated 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies will really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to safeguard their own interests and become carnival comparsas of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
Hence, he spoke of their certification of the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to advance the Ruler in turn.
"We take care that they come to do a decent job and above all committed to society and sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotels Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow encourage the generation of jobs."
As for the tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight that he has within the state budget to strengthen the Secretary of State Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is inconsistent as an important economic activity that generates foreign exchange and investment and that directly competes with the agro industry."
In addition to that it is necessary to label resources to detonating tourism projects and that they help in providing security to the state and in updating the Alcohol Law that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Seeking a Wizard King
Dolls, carts and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, next Kings Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of no more and no less than 12 people and one goat.
However, Adelaide, Elizabeth, Jesus, Joseph Alfred, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, Joseph John and Michael do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house of the Salvador Allende Colony and live a day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Well, sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn't have chamba, but we sell mandarin and dad... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, aspires for a long time to have a 'monster' car and for his brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I told him 'let's see son,' because he was very expensive," Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children, those in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
11-year-old Maria Guadalupe is size 12; 10-year-old Isaiah is size 10, while 8-year-old Michael is size 8.
Jose Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the Search for a Magician King campaign, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest Reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out as part of the dismantling of a Cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
Persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly where drug production took place.
"About 750 Cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of Cannabis production, possession with the aim of trafficking, plotting and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have followed a long investigation that has lasted for about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests," said Mr.Ruel.
This police operation involved around seventy officers from the Quebec Security Estrie investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
Illegal migration can be combated without problems
The Conservative bill, which, according to the government, should solve the problem of the boats loaded with clandestine migrants, will surely face a great opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
"I am here with a party that has created the granite you step on," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a vessel identified as transporting clandestine immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also indicated that he could not support the bill because it targets the wrong target.
"We are against it and, apparently, all opposition parties are against the project, so we'll see what the government does," said Mr.Ducepe.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has flatly rejected criticism that her party is not strong enough with clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that measures should be taken against those in charge of illegal law enforcement, and that is what we intend to do with another bill, the C-35," says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," explains Mrs Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," Minister Kenney says.
The Government had not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government was going to request a vote so that each Member who is going to oppose is later explained to his constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption unit and the collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation has been a matter since January last year.
The metropolis has a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
The announcement on Tuesday has therefore caught more than one by surprise.
It can be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic who deals with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of the joker" and as "a last-minute botched solution."
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest refuses to set up this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break this deadlock, he suggested that Quebec should give a special mandate to the financial controller general to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the financial controller-general," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the controller the same powers as a commissioner, thus enabling him to force persons to testify.
The creation of a permanent gang is not the only project under way in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to make it better suited to this type of crime.
This request appears to have come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this subject.
During the Spring 2001 operation concerning biker groups, although the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons had been arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauricio.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
In addition, an additional 20-40 millimetres are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
Sectors to the north of the river and the Outaouais Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these rainfalls are added to the snow thaw that had already accumulated in certain sectors, there are fears that several rivers will be overflowing.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and of Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, 10 residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several tracks, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civilian security unit remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, as indicated by Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Centre, for its part, broadcast on Wednesday announcements communicating the strong floods of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partially Blame Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback to the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) over controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as their rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "incorrect information about social assistance, improperly negative representation of Haitians, and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Council also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, do not violate broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were not correct.
The presenters must communicate reliable data and not lead to deception.
In relation to suicide, the present Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the contested episodes of "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any blame has been dropped in this regard.
The last dispute concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had led a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The presenter of CHOI stated that he had made no donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes improperly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the use of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio network has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences shall be minimal for the broadcaster, who shall, inter alia, announce decisions once in the hours of the largest hearing within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montrealese of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, climbs to the tattoos and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance in professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy playing on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championships, held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China".
"They will invite athletes who have finished among the top four in the last world championship in each category".
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline native to China in which it is allowed to strike with fists and feet as well as throw opponents to the ground.
Clashes are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only hold a competition in his career, he will certainly attend the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thai's largest stadium)."
"It's been an amazing experience."
Zemmal has won his first bout, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who beat me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"Semifinal winners face in final of their category".
"Next, the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of the kung-fu".
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the consortium Énergie gérance obtained the lucrative contract without prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, resorting to consortiums of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition".
"I mean, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," said Quebec Party MP Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can benefit in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denying a collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" way and "with a lack of rigor."
He noted that the "minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In the whole case, the contract was awarded without competition; it was a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of consortia in the technical advice sector is being subject to investigation in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's commercial registry allows more than 200 consortia to be identified, some of which appear permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
Regarding the consortium Énergie gérance, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular workforce dynamic and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the consortium Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, regardless of their participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Énergie gérance contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has implied that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Quebec Liberal Party".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is rather about its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The Québec consumer has little confidence in sustainable development actors, fair trade brands or ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the responsible consumption barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumption swarm, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this even slows his commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of the companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of the responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates bearing the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "correspondable," says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, gaps and the doubtful nature of the information mean that 46 per cent of consumers reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also claim to be suspicious of the supposed yields of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumer of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the king of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social consciousness seems to be of doors (of your car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking trips.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back from Daniel Langlois the film complex eXcentris on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and to give back their true cinephilic vocation, did not get what they were asking for.
The Government has agreed to engage in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would, in fact, be lower than initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and an application of $12.8 million last spring, but since then applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, forwarded a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have a deadline of 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a donation from the State should be completely discarded.
Let us remember that the Association of Cinema Owners and Film Complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector do demand considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has carried for ten years the burden of author cinema in his premises of the complex, after financing his own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of independent movie theaters is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had known how to loyalize his clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are promoting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to screen films in eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, screening Xavier Beauvois' precious film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted...
New U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers to be the Canadians' complex over Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter's feeling of superiority over Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-US relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable of September 22, 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues discussed by the political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the U.S. ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of almost inherent inferiority to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to speak of it."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Of course, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which voters should think about voting."
This sense of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival during the vote of confidence in early February over the federal budget, through which Canada will register for the first time deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40 billion," writes Mr. Breese.
No mention is made anywhere that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition from replacing it or that opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image broadcast by the dramatic series broadcast on the United States CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issuance of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which makes little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to conduct energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that, during its first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to host some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that he did, but that he depended "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"Secretary agreed to review file".
Finally, we can mention that the moods have warmed up regarding the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
Mike Huckabee is echoed in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancún a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by nearly one third of the additional reduction that must be made to stabilize the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of concrete major projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided to enlighten humans.
Lighting accounts for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of global car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should still be reduced to stabilize, by 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is reduced even twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above that, they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have expressed reservations about fluorocompact light bulbs, since they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers issue instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not fluocompact light bulbs, but coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted with incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save a billion dollars a year on electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, given that the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," says a spokesman for the head of the UN.
"Call on all Côte d'Ivoire parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the election commission has allowed the deadline to pass from Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days since Sunday's scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the president of the CIS had commented to television that the commission "was still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday the world has multiplied the demands that the CIS finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo side has the constitutional Council's annulment of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Ivory Coast president's campaign, has claimed that the FN's election intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The entire election could be overturned if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's adversaries consider that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged as "unacceptable" the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that lodging a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the icing on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivorian political class that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received publicly the support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent on the mainland (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the corrected data with provisional seasonal variations (SVCs) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed stays at 2,631,000 in continental France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population in continental territory and 9.7% with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and seek employment or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over the age of 50, a figure of 6.6 per cent with DOMs.
Unemployment has only been stable among people aged 25-49, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the president PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guerini is being investigated for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, according to her lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all questions posed to him by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It's easy to chase him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, had told AFP prior to his client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and imprisoned one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to your lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done has been to take care of the landfills you must manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the allocation of funds related to their execution, he knew nothing about it, according to counsel Simon.
Within the framework of this file, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the Aubagne urban agglomeration services, has also been investigated for embezzlement and complicity, but has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken account of the explanations and released him," explained his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday to Wednesday, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been charged with "trafficking in influences and passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "subtraction and embezzlement of public goods by a person engaged in public service" and for "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "cover-up of the abuse of social goods".
Among the people who have faced Mr.Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have served to launder the capital of great banditry.
The investigation is being conducted within the framework of a number of judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that the research focuses especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elisha has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has held the public in France to a halt, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
Describe how the Elisha has explained his strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "hostages" crisis in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by U.S. justice for trafficking materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency attempted to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
Eliseo's advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, converse with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continuously release" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "inocence," "immediate liberation."
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more frequently."
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discreet channels are exhausted, "silence will solve nothing," Iranians are "experts in delaying maneuvers."
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a common Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros reward).
In addition, he points out that the Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "is going to increase".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by a decision of a judge.
The U.S. embassy, like numerous observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which closes Iranian clandestine procurement networks for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guarantees that it did not.
El Elisha, he says, not only "has he been greatly surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot overturn the judicial decision", he comments.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of the French information services.
Elisha's advisor marks a telephone number, hangs up, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elisha spares no effort, using media-organized communiqués and "leaks" to make believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential" role of "mediator".
Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and see that manipulation brings its fruit, since several press articles broadcast the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the reason for this "gratitude" towards Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
"Despite their praiseful statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that have led the Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he says.
A policy launched in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been branded premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris attempts to "show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows from good sources.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we've thanked him."
"At least this should lead to confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at Eliseo.
In a statement, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirio for having played an "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
As of midnight, Korean youth cannot play online
The South Korean government is going to adopt a law called "Cinderella's" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, as indicated by representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, a ministerial officer responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government also intends to ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games when the parents of the young people so request, added the person responsible.
In addition, it will make available to anyone who requests it free software that allows to limit the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced another 58 countries.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA designates organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee designates Thursday the countries organizing the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension of two EC members (Keynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) for corruption, could thus have ruined the chances of their country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the stake on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has exposed three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and embarrass English officials, who have thrown themselves into an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The Head of Government hopes to reissue the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had managed to organize the JJOOs in London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's brilliance to the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spanish-Portugal duo also has many strong points thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only manage to give points to Russia, turned into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in their candidacy (stages, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the accusations by the English press against EC members.
"They are bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which had the experience of 1994, seemed to be the most logical favourites.
First world economic power and home to the main FIFA sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new applications seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the concession of the World Cup 2026 to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be harmed by the weakness of TV fees paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had implied that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of State will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, evidence of this does not go well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, one must always appear to doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, even if they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that it deals with the MPs in the UMP on Tuesday night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused a certain stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not at all.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It simply conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has spoken of presidential women, with a jockey tone, in meetings of this kind.
"In the worst, or best, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Do not think that I do not ask myself what will come next."
His statements the day before yesterday do not bring him any closer to the candidacy, nor any less.
They raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race by running on the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone up to the shoulder that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
On the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what prompts many PS people to demand that the battle be organized ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and prudently.
"If he thinks he can lose, he won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations which should end by the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation in the European bond markets today.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in helping to resolve the debt crisis of the European States.
It did not mean whether it considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its programme for the purchase of State bonds.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent in terms of his intentions, indicating only that the programme of buying State Letters in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to around €1.350 billion.
Moreover, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday I would have bought Irish and Portuguese securities again.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystem have acquired securities amounting to EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in course.
Although lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial conditions and durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists hope that this device will be extended for a few months today.
"I can't imagine you're going to change your program considerably."
"If not, it would risk provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, an economist at the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," Norbert Bräms, an economist in Sal, anticipates.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of such obligations in order to keep the market stable", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a sharp rise in the returns paid by the most fragile states," said an important bond manager yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are skyrocketing, States will have even more trouble reducing their indebtedness, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi’s government dominates the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflow of the 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
Upon the departure of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "undecipherable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy risk hedging contracts (CRQ) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing a certain stir in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" about "the turbulence in the markets" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that he's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its funding needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
Italian growth is estimated to reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the government deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (as opposed to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be adopted," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested of Italy are less than those required of other countries," comments Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a decision-making period would not be conducive in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already demonstrated Sunday night and day that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, yesterday's relaxation in the types of obligations of European States has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of standardisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower the rating of Portugal's debt, the most frequent target in today's speculations.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the pace of markets."
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries are stepping up discussions to strengthen existing mechanisms for overcoming the crisis.
Informal consultations between finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also takes into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin earlier next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has launched a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the new developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly paves the way.
The first issues of EFSF titles are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative has entrusted the Reuters agency with supporting a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As regards the countries in the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path from that followed by Greece and Ireland.
They both want to avoid at all costs seeking international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider essential to building confidence in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are considering the options available to speed up the process of normalising public bond markets.
Throughout Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the €75 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
Barclays Capital economists, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe that an additional 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The instrument for this is the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently has EUR 60 billion.
A council which could certainly examine the European capitals in detail.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 apartments on orange alert
Snowfalls continue to cause circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, 24 departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also slightly snows on the island of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those in the regions of Lower Normandy, Isle of France and Limousin.
Snowfalls are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, Météo France alerts.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmes, the traffic in the secondary network in Brittany is complicated and therefore they recommend that it should not be driven except in case of need and the movement of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
On Thursday, school transportation in Picardy has been banned.
No specific measures had been planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy Paris airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday because of the planned snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the island of France has reached its peak, billions of dollars have rained.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4 billion euros.
At the theoretical level, this amount will subsequently allow GSP to obtain loans on the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The Amending Finance Act 2010, which was discussed in the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the office tax on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate that increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get from this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from $4 billion.
"It is necessary that the fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that the State will mobilise and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as we explained."
"To be recorded in the budget and used according to needs".
The GSP estimates that it will begin to receive $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised $4 billion is not included in the credit, can lead to a slightly lively parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avengerous Hackers and Prompt Spies
The WikiLeaks affair has double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long given cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret records should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the nonexistent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little appetite) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I don't know, Libération editor), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the US embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as the Newsweek published the previous week.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of States can call on the phone or catch the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have been transformed into spy centers.
Anyone watching research films knows that perfectly well, we just seem not to know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, public repetition violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea of anyone being able to consult the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "verdiges".
But let us enter the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, he could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer hold its own secrets be endured?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public realm; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and a lot, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to place any reserved information on the web, as it would be like posting it on a street sign.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, you cannot expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State has flown and contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is science fiction and, therefore, novelism, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly on errands with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by heart or, at most, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
That information is then preserved, in a single copy, in locked drawers: ultimately, the Watergate's spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the cableless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a wired telegraph (telephone).
Video tapes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of the editing, while now the (digital) CDs only allow for moving forward or backward from chapter to chapter, i.e. to huge proportions.
With the high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the journeys it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was secretly planned in embassies.
At present, it is embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's slump in its financing pledges
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unblocked funding pledges (called fast start or early start) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French chapuzas have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.260 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that their commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major follow-up event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparent operation was a significant result and appreciated for what it really is: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2010 €2.2 billion, which puts it on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we look at the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as its reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or the level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, France's total aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while respecting its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element is the distribution between grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider each euro borrowed to be equivalent to a donated euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain profitable investments (often emission reduction projects based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At best, only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be computed for its commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of €420 million by making 91.5% loans (€389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (€36.1 million); see the EU document for your own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes a euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a negative double impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a relatively short-term minutiae in relation to the climate negotiations as a whole.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could move forward with discussions on the stakes in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the issue of "additional character" or the method of computing loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move the negotiations forward.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old ingests 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the former movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a child of about ten years old usually consumes in four meals and a snack a day.
These model foods, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as sweets, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered as safe carcinogens, as well as about 20 residues that may harm the hormone system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian fillet, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutrient" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk posed by these "pollutant cocktails" to the consumer is "probably underestimated," the study says.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
