Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are concerned with "appearing to be muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this may be ridiculed.
A Member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned "that he rhymed with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A Member of the Welsh Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party stated that his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that the pronunciation leap from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Welsh Parliament the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option gained most of the support in a public consultation.
Apparently, members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring Assembly President Elin Jones to the fore, who should submit the change bill in a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of Assembly Members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of what they should be called when they deliberate on legislation.
Macedonians flock to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for membership of the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin keep silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the older people I've spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," says Mr.Adams.
"Today, there is neither one thing nor the other."
He pointed out that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"Now people socialize differently," he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which the neighbors regularly go."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after, they will return to the starting point."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and therefore will speed up the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will end up being members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and Saint Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The building was acquired by a black congregation that was worshipping nearby.
A Black congregation took the reins of St. Martin, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting Black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged and, while Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the lane.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called it "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert who played the lane called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, noted that she was the world's first rung used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left to play the largest Riverside Church lane 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St.Martin in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese would "try to pass the costs" on to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Hurts a 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California the day the lobster season opened, authorities said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed the San Diego KSWB-TV channel that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then he realized that "he was screaming that he had been bitten.
,
He had a broken collarbone," Hammel observed when he arrived next to the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to come out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, which have many skilled employees in the corridors of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK’s beauty market, valued at £2800 trillion and with growth increasing compared to the fall in fashion sales and household goods, the larger beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if they successfully surpass it, the same will be done in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this supermarket chain looks for ways to use the space on shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and householdware.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its range of Boutique makeup with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume shop The Fragrance Shop will test its concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments, the first newly opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week. The second will be inaugurated in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift towards the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to fight off Aldi and Lidl discount stores by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points into hundreds of establishments and introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted grocery sales and further leveraged these acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the proceeds of pharmaceutical outlets in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, a company owned by the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's commented: "We have transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty corridors so that they enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specialized staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offer is designed to suit all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination of beauty products, challenging the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11 million deal.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, went "furious" after television host Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to fashion brand and Truly accessories.
This business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old hostess This Morning announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by leaving his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the television gold girl admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to £1.5 million, did not allow time to dedicate themselves to Truly, her fashion brand and accessories, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was profiled as a favorite to double Willoughby's fortune of about 11 million pounds.
As Willoughby, 37, announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one referenced: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her in the next two decades.
His decision to abandon left everyone involved totally shocked.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters, ready-to-sale products."
Experts believe that the departure of the hostess of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
Couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a host of the I'm A Celebrity program on the ITV channel.
A source close to Jones claimed that last night "no business issues were discussed."
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He was joking about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented with his scoffing voice of "newsman."
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting him again after Trump praised the first meeting held in Singapore in June, which he considered a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see a "adequate response" from the US to the first steps towards North Korea's disarmament.
On the contrary, he said, the US continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in his speech during his rally.
"We got along great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of the missile tests, help free hostages and bring the remains of American soldiers back home.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing to the people who were right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to move, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, which complicates things a little," explains Mrs Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send Palu, they still have no certainty as to whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Considering that the earth is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling from one island of Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo turned the improvement of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure into the centrepiece of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railway lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko's administration, which is facing re-election next year.
In addition, it must face pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as bands of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool equals the score against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 meters from Chelsea's goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second stick.
The action sent it over the area and headed towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was coming and I gave him a touch. I didn't think about it too much, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midpoint made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic on that move, before turning around haggling near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice pass into space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and finished by throwing the ball into the net of the second pole with a kick on the left foot that Alisson Becker of Liverpool could not stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool plays against Napoli in the group phase of the Champions League. The meeting will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
For its part, Chelsea faces Videoton at UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's emergency agency early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of the buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday, which unleashed waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was covered by the remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, which resulted in the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but it would encourage anyone who was near Jonah Street in Birkenhead to have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend to anyone, especially taxi drivers, that they have been able to capture something in Dashcam that would contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim ' s relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his apartment, but the police tell him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was puzzled when he found out what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed back in within a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the place in tears.
He keeps repeating "it's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several officers stood inside the cordon controlling the block of floors.
Anyone with information is requested to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at number 0800 555 111, registration 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the latest commemorative success for "rewriting history"
Their prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr.Crick's suggestions as a "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that taking Oliver Cromwell's figure out of Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
The wrong Cromwell may be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy to celebrate.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than at present, an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a fully accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historic debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A killer pig attacks a Chinese cattleman
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned artery covered with blood near a dump in the market of Lippanshui, Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder prepares to inject vaccines into pigs from a pigsty in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby dump was open.
He said there was a big pig in the dump with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig of nearly 250 kilos had attacked the cattleman to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and shattered," said the cousin, to whom they headed by his last name, "Wu", to The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager informed The Evening News that the pig was locked up to stop him from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence on the site.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they're rare, it's not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 295 kilos cornered a cattleman in his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After pigs ate an Oregon cattleman in 2012, a Manitoba cattleman told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "shooter."
"They're just playing.
They're like kids, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What needs to be done is to have the right respect for them," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy widespread rains in the southwest of the United States.
As planned, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains all over northern Mexico and the U.S. southwest in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind gusts of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday morning at 5 a.m. (East Time) and was located almost 620 kilometers south-west of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are beginning to develop, moving eastwards to the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to drive the intense tropical rains northwards, toward the U.S. southwest.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain hits the low pressure that is approaching, there will be strong generalised rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause rainfall of about 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Owing to the scattered nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding may occur with rapidly worsening conditions.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended at all to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms will cause bumpy winds and clouds of dust locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rains in specific parts of the southern California coast.
The torrential rains may leave up to two centimeters of water, which could cause small streams of debris and make the roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become general at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October there will be some intense changes in temperature in the US due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes this involves drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout Central America on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long heat of summer will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the U.S., a warm beginning of October is expected, with general temperatures around 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures of up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average, could be reached in New York City.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above average for the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh appear
More than 20 million people followed the heartbreaking testimonies that Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s, gave on Thursday on six television stations.
Meanwhile, the policy remained deadlocked and the media interrupted their usual programming to broadcast Friday's latest news: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Commission that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a state of drunkenness and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that that had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people commenting on Nielsen on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of a playoffs football game or the Oscar Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose talkers have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fuel the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long appearance, said Nielsen.
ABC ranked second, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, a great deal of interest continued to be shown.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement informing that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras captured how protesters shouted at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a court appearance.
While receiving these reproaches, broadcast live by CNN, he was dejected.
"Looking at my face," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued, "You have power when there are so many women who don't."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would tell more in his appearance before the Commission.
Cable television and radio stations broadcast everything live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to nominate Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do it if the FBI investigated the charges made against the candidate during the following week, which some Democrats had been asking for.
Flake was convinced, partly by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics with their plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and of undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Congress of the Conservative Party to be held in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published next to his on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers' supposed plan for Brexit, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge the other's tariffs was "totally absurd."
Wayde Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of Death of LSU Player · Global Voices
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police point out that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A security deposit of $350,000 has been established, according to the defense.
The East Baton Rouge District Examining Court issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a gunshot wound to the back of the head that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, sports director of LSU, thanked the area's police forces for their "diligency and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, measuring more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU.
He had earned an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game of the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that his team is "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
"These are the things people always care about," Wade said.
A volcano throws ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods to the south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and jolts.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash coating the windscreens of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 magnitude hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police confront Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters faced riot control while thousands of people participated in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists who had been cut off by riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes in later hours and police used batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups, with messages such as "no forgetfulness or forgiveness", faced unionist protesters with the cry of "Viva España".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters elected independence by overwhelming majority, although participation was low, as the people who were against secession boycotted the referendum to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted to prevent voting at polling stations throughout the region, where violent clashes took place.
The pro-independence groups camped Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration went on, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer expected Catalonia to become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy at voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pretrial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for ramming a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 19:30 at Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage was caused to the entrances and the building itself.
At some point, he may have shot himself in the car with a crossbow.
Menga's attack gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by winning the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as a coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference. Gary Holt's put up a position, with the Hibernian in second position.
This season, Gerrard's have not yet won any wins outside the house and next Sunday they are facing Hearts, leaders of the board with eight points of advantage.
Previously, the Rangers received Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Meanwhile, the Livingston expands its winning streak in the division to six games. Holt, head coach, has not yet tasted the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a forceful visitor
Holt's team had to have gone one step ahead long before dialing, causing all sorts of trouble to the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson overcame the defense, but failed his attempt in front of goal. Later, Alan Lithgow got the stray shot after boarding to finish Craig Halkett’s head center in front of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause visitors trouble with standing ball plays.
That's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston searched for an entry, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, which hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but they couldn't get past the host's defense and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
That game continued until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop of Kelly.
Allan McGregor, Ranger goalkeeper rejected a shot of Scott Pittman with one kick, and Lithgow was far from another play by Livingston.
Long passes were constantly entering the Livingston area, but they were always cleared. Two requests for penalty were rejected, one after a Halkett entry over substitute Glenn Middleton and one for one hand.
Livingston's "Fine" (analysis)
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for the Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an upward trajectory.
His style of play and staff have hardly changed since his rise, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
I was counting on a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team's captain, was huge and led a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they fell short.
They failed to materialize the moves, as they only managed to enter the opposite field once, which is a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive him in the country.
These manifestations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by the paramedics, but died right there.
The accident occurs after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that ran off on Childers Street, nearly two kilometres from the crash site on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at a high-security male prison, according to the Directorate of the Prison.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from an elite team (called "Tornate") are in charge of controlling altercations, involving eight inmates and affecting a pavilion.
The officers received assistance for minor injuries to the face at the site.
A spokesman for the Prison Service comments: "Specialised prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
Violence is not tolerated in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be placed in the hands of the police and could spend more time behind bars."
The Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after an inmate attacked him.
In addition, in October last year riot police were asked to go to prison to face a serious disturbance in which prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (arid areas could benefit)
It's unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen earlier next week when Hurricane Rosa's last hilts crossed the southwest of the desert, at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, south and east Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had preserved their state of tropical storm or depression within a radius of 321 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rains, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Escarpment in Arizona.
It is likely that between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain will fall, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, the rains of Rosa can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently experienced in the south-west.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's itinerary will hit the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum bursts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to flow into Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"We expect torrential rains of between 7 and 15 centimetres from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimetres," as reported on weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north for Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Later, she will travel through Arizona to southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the heavy torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. desert," says the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old youth have been arrested as suspects in an assassination attempt after another 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4:00 on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital, where he remains stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened to the mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the session about this accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, the "Americans saw Kavanaugh's cunning, quality and courage."
"To vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a jurist with an admirable record in the service of the public," he told his West Virginia followers.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy by talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"It's five weeks away for one of the most important choices of our lives.
I don't introduce myself, but it's a career," he said.
"That's why I'm going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates."
Trump claimed that Democrats are embarking on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be held no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party leadership officer reported to CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When yesterday it was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, which is why they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said. The tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by Friday's big earthquake was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the damaged buildings, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho pointed out that the number of victims and the damage could be greater along the 300 km north coast of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"Over 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not reporting that a tsunami had struck Palu, although those responsible claim that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, one hears a man standing on the top floor of a building warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, taking buildings and cars ahead.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but the evacuated people still need food and other commodities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under tarpaulins installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they'd seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as aid groups set in motion the gears of disaster assistance, some people lamented that the movement of experienced co-workers to Palu was not being allowed.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a catastrophe at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn't happened yet."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of people who were still missing still had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolate stories that write the natural catastrophes.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the paragliders missing for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the hotel Roa Roa, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
"Because of my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who participated in the festival held on the beach.
However, their messages showed only one verification mark in grey, not two in blue.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26 750 during an ATM recharge at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves mugged a Brink employee who was reloading an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26 750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the entertainment center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man "approached running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for recharging.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities must contact the Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons", as the creator of the program commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had religious significance for him.
"I think it's the most widely used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West commented earlier this year as he talked about the album's title with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
He went from being Kanye, meaning ‘the only one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It is one of the many famous rappers that has changed its name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in upper case or lower case, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican President-elect, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would "never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking hold throughout Latin America.
López Obrador is committed to providing support to Mexican youth by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to integrate into criminal gangs.
The US should double I.A. funding.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in artificial intelligence research, says Kai-Fu Lee, I.A.’s investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments then arise the I.A.-related announcements of various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become number one in innovation in IA by 2030.
"Duplicating I.A.'s research budget would be a good start, since all other countries are far behind the U.S. We look forward to the next breakthrough in the I.A. field," says Lee.
Double funding means twice the chance that the next major achievement in I.A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's leading I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that defeated Othello’s best American player. He was later an executive at Microsoft Research and chairman of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee gave recognition to the previous technological competitions of the US government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would allow the next generation of visionaries to be identified.
In the U.S., researchers often have to do a lot of work to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired leading people from universities to work at I.A.
Lee commented that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. intensify its I.A. initiatives.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The Council of State of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to attract partners from the industrial and academic fields. For its part, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than USD 100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held on Sunday on whether their name will change to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidacy for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, the majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The ballot for the referendum raised the following question: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, quite a few Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote in the Macedonia referendum on a change of name of the country that would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and removed chairs in front of tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to come in like Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says joining NATO would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research ensured that between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which means less than the required participation.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
Should it fail, it would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, dodges the entire Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling broke out the Brighton defense in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine mediapunta received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before entering open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He dodged one defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a left pass, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Agüero has some foot problems," said Pep Guardiola, City coach, to reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League competition.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball deep within Brighton territory.
He made a nice ball pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before directing Sterling to the second stick.
Sky blues striker threw the ball into the net just before he stepped out of bounds.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to wait for the Rockies to party.
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff contest, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they triumphed against Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League, they still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard position thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still pursue their first division title.
"Even though we don't play at all, we can at least step on the rubber with the certainty that Denver's audience will be cheered up and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I've ever faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but it seems they are inclined to let Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal break on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump gives a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November everything we have done is at stake.
Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's one of the most important. I don't introduce myself, but it's a career, that's why I'm going from one place to another struggling to get great candidates," he said.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary, you see meanness, evil.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
"We've seen it these past four days," he said, saying the Democrats "were furious, bad, horrible, and false."
She referred to the Senate Judicial Commission appointing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received booing from the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you print the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of views.
He's intolerant to people who say what they think.
When my local party's Momentum activists voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row of Labour Party Members of Parliament to be told that I am not welcome, and just to say what we think.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe. It is ironic that these were matters on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a member of the local Labour Party Parliament, that is exactly what the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "kinder and kinder" policy is already more than forgotten, if it was actually applied at some point.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged by whether or not party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to change his mind radically and adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each "censorship" motion or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many advices that recommended keeping my head down and not making me hear so much and that would "be fine".
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a high school student, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to ignore my political stances or the areas where I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday's motion is that I don't understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country leads a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the game may have decided to some extent the final result, but Ayr undoubtedly deserved the victory in this very entertaining game of Tennent's Premiership Day.
Now they head the board and is the only undefeated team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to take better advantage of the opportunities, that awarded the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been tested in all the matches and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose commented: "The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of opportunities better than we do."
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Clime, placed the Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan to the game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot got an unconverted essay.
Climo extended the Ayr’s advantage with a penalty. Before, just in half time, he marked and converted a solo essay, which left the score in 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
However, the Melrose started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who had to be removed on a stretcher, and, upon resumption of the game, the Ayr advanced with an essay by Stafford McDowall converted by Clime.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed the Melrose again to take advantage that they had one more man with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for signing Clime without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson did a rehearsal when he was in the back of the advancing maul.
Climo converted him, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong with one kick and sent the Gregor Henry wing to the back to get the fifth rehearsal of the locals.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to direct his career towards the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems determined to move to the catering sector after it is revealed that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, who writes and co-stars with his many-year-old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to make any comment on the matter, although a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flowering restaurant market."
"The sea belongs to us": a landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings they wave navy blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
It's a duty to get it back."
Across Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly recall the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the longing to re-sea the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a resolution by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the court in The Hague will pronounce itself in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign way out of the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is waging a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has a lot to say about Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the closing arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may have been hindered over the past four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
In addition, he suggested that Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Also, Calzadilla denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never be the first to carry out nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come at the time when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be about to resume a stalled nuclear diplomatic talks more than three months after this summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that continuing continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to subdue the North is a "quimera."
Washington is wary of accepting the statement without Pyongyang making any meaningful disarmament movement before.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness of giving up an arsenal that the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric oversized hats for their spring summer 2019 collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other large complements were watermelons with jewelry, a sorcerer hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation reminded of a complete diving team, snorkel and glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you're in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could begin to be seen on the shopping streets.
The big hats come by stepping on the hand of "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters worn by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this impractical hat that flooded the social networks presented another great creation on the catwalk: a beach bag of straw as big as the model in swimsuit that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the main piece of Jacquemus's La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large complements."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental to the citizens of the world
Independent educational institutions in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary test results that is reinforced by individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the schools.
As Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it reaches his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the qualifier tables, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS centres, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as they are considered a fundamental competence that both children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Currently, as a subject, languages are considered to be at the same level as CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that, of the reasons given by employers for the difficulties they faced in filling jobs, 17% were attributed to the shortage of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Potential job opportunities that require languages are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with persons from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically anticipate competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for today's children.
If they know several languages, especially those in developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools he or she will always be able to choose between several languages taught by specialized teaching staff in this field.
Scotland's independent educational centres devote every effort to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as "competences for international communication".
Independent colleges will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron debuts with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait of fans waiting to see LeBron James debut in their first game with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, has announced that James will play the opening match of the preseason to be held on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes you will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton commented on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James was likely to play a limited few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason program.
"At this stage of my career I don't need preseason games to prepare myself," he said.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump launches a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate's confirmation vote to fill the waiting Supreme Court vacancy, Trump seeks support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you view it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's appearances of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who were tense because of allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and have put on hold an early Senate confirmation vote for, at most, a week while the FBI is investigating them.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections take momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign pointed out that next week's five rallies aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they retain in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters that he did not want to give his name.
Scheduled at Wesbanco Arena Stadium in Wheeling tonight's rally could attract supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage of Pittsburgh," as reported by West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month for Trump to visit West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows that it dares to fight to keep hope alive in the face of Sunday's individual matches.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of impulse is a completely invented sports concept, but players truly believe in it, even more in competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
"They took us six points of advantage and now they take us four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel that they have some wind in favor and plenty of reasons to be encouraged, among other reasons by the couple made up of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
Gutural shouts of celebration went up in volume as his round advanced, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth match when he and Thomas went down two holes.
The putt that gave them the game in 15 was greeted with a similar shout, from those who broadcast that they believe that the American team has not yet been left out.
"What needs to be redoubled and concentrated on the party," Spieth said.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple in Europe has four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way it flows its energy with the bustling public make it clear that these are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets in Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Still, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four balls of the morning, after partnering with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn't get out of.
But on Sunday there won't be any help getting out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see closely because you appreciate the interactions between couples, the tips they give and those they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead for the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team dares to fight, something some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe is ahead of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leaves with a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a result of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the competition with two victories over a Tiger Woods that was in trouble, leading four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points out of Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, his magnificent union served to defeat a disheartened Woods and American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau for a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who in the two matches on Saturday had not highlighted too much, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches of fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, was once again the pair of Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in southwest Paris, Europe did not have it all on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory against Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the initial two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, that a team recovers from a four-point difference in individual matches has only happened on two occasions, although Furyk, as holder of the trophy, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says that "there is no chance" that they will be disarmed first unilaterally if they have no confidence
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened his distrust in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated to the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had taken "important measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility that we will first disarm unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as he did not simply reject a unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even by objecting to a declaration of end of war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which was announced by the U.S. leader at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, the leader of South Korea, over the past five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea's missiles to American soil after the "malignant president" Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim "a rocket man."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in advancing towards disarmament, but said that much remained to be done and that further sanctions were needed until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time frame set for this: "It can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for his progress.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without non-compliance until we realize the definitive and fully verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea reported that its "requirements were those of a mobster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course this year at Harvard University, all college students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing sexist culture of studying all night long by drinking caffeine.
One professor discovered that students at the world's number one university often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, believed to be the first in his class in the United States.
His motivation to start the course arose after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl came up and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her senior year.
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of the dream, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university's health services, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleeplessness on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression, and cancer.
Afterwards, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
He stated that the culture of pride in "sleeping the night" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure to which students are subjected meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and a good quality dream should be "the secret weapon" of students to fight stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is for students to think about setting up an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal tombs Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression outside the home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 loss in Livingston.
Ibrox wanted their first homecoming win since the February 4-1 win in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team eight points away from the Hearts, outcast leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack took place minutes before half-time and the uninspired Rangers' alignment was never up to it at any time.
Now, the Rangers are down to sixth, the Livingston is up to third, behind the Hibernian by the goal difference.
The Rangers may find themselves in more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly threw an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard switched to eight of the headlines who won the match against Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 players from Livingston who ripped a point out of the Hearts last week and would have been happy for the way his highly organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but the Livingston took better advantage of the ball when he had it.
They should have dialed two minutes from the start, when Menga made a pass into space for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs took a deep foul for Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out for the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been punished in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson turned a deaf ear to the Colombian's petition.
The Rangers got two goal shots in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was barely in trouble to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the boring release of Oviedo Ejaria.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by Livingston came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it because of the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' deep ball play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit the ball for Scott Robinson, who remained calm and passed it to Menga to score the goal.
On the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the steering wheel passed to Morelos, but impressive Kelly stepped out of his line to block it.
Still, the Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the kind of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's might have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow topped a head corner that didn't go in.
The Rangers' substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a run-in with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
The accountant Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Coronado Bells", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
By putting on your headphones, you can hear the effect of waves emitted by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and re-inject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," such as breast, ovary, lung, or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.

Kanye West was booed at the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to someone white and ask me how I might like Trump if he's racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started Matt Damon's sketch show in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault.
Although not retransmitted, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's video recording to social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
Besides, West told the public that he had a bad time behind the scenes for wearing that cap.
"They messed with me.
They told me not to go out with my hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how asleep I am?" and added that he "was going to put on his superman cape, because that meant that no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments were booed by the public on at least two occasions and SNL members seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine, "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West bewildered many when he went out on stage to sing I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING TO THE MANY."
Karen Hunter, host of an interview program, tweeted that West was simply "being himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying their music or clothing, or supporting their art) who I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that his name had been changed, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also called himself Snoop Lion, not forgetting the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted stabbing murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear on Monday at the Belfast Court of First Instance.
Prosecutor's office will review the charges.
Harrington Kit, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of the HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that these on-screen roles often passed on to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old cast partner in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, admitted that she found it "quite important" to address this issue.
"Personally, I think it's quite important right now, where have we been wrong about masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?"
Kit believes that television can have part of the responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, claiming that he is "harto of battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard's play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes that meeting his wife Rose is the best he's ever gotten out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Nieve, in the fantastic series awarded with Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on a Leslie family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has declined almost entirely, the Chinese health authorities said at a congress in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT collective suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of conservative values in the country, studies have estimated that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are because they do not use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaks data from Republican Party senators and claims that these are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters criticized on Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican Party senators on Wikipedia's legislative pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these allegations were driven by "extreme right" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies," Waters commented in a Twitter post.
The published information allegedly included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel session regarding allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct made against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate.
The leak took place sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not at all responsible for the leaking of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement elicited immediate criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"You deny this information with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests not the temperance needed to become a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
You must not rebel.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and calm."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to derail Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," she tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations."
"We will make sure the authors are discovered," he continued, "and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all my staff members."
Johnny English Review: Back in Action. Rowan Atkinson's Spy's parody falls short
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit winks in any new film with a British focus. It seems that this is what should be done with this new installment of the parodic action and comedy franchise Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-satisfaction be about how clearly foolish we are the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his jumping eyes and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to screw up for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comical creation designed for non-English-speaking cinephilic territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions to waste glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that type who touched a single note on the theme of Firecars that was played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, his origin was based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in Barclaycard's already forgotten television ads, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last installment, there are one or two good times.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor while the propellers collided against the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy pops up, but humor gets pretty short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that franchises of "serious" films like 007 and impossible Mission add comic ingredients without problems.
Humor seems more aimed at children than adults and, to me, Johnny English's absurd misadventures are not as witty and accurate as Atkinson's silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain's supersecret network of spies, revealing the identities of all its active agents in the face of the consternation of the agent in service, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the straw that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and cornered character who is watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself in this character who is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn't leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, since all active spies are in danger, he will have to resort to one who is retired.
That has to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches in a posh school, although he teaches unofficial classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy academy similar to that of Rock School.
Español is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his long-suffering former buddy Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice role for whom Vicki Pepperdine is not taking enough advantage.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous grip of a billion-dollar charismatic world of technology that claims it can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; moreover, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize itself with the interior of Volta's house.
They were definitely used thoroughly in that latter sequence, but, as funny and shocking as it may be, the set continues to convey a somewhat childish sensation.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really do justice to her talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but charge five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the owners of the companies to allocate the savings made through the revolution in artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would "fit" the party's plans and economic agenda of leaning the country in favor of the workers.
This change to a four-day week has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official commented to The Sunday Times: The announcement of a review of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day workweek is definitely an issue that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party already promised a four-day work week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, for the time being, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy and will not be discussed at this time."
The shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to regain powers from "anonymous directors" and "used" by utilities.
The shadow minister's plans also include the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies will not recover their full share, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of directors of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10% of the shares of private sector companies have to be allocated to employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation around Kavanaugh and if I could make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed at least a week's final vote for confirmation as a Supreme Court judge and, in addition, raises the question whether the results that are concluded could influence any Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham talk about whether the FBI could bring out information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Sure, of course," Kennedy said.
"I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that the allegation came out and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, determined, sharp."
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
"I already have a decision made about Brett Kavanaugh and would overlook the accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she appoints have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive poster of stars gathers for an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the actual goal of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or anything else that will help raise awareness about your goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved 12 years after reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of so-called "clictivism," which is called the stance we take when we think we are doing something really useful by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have got world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers united with a common commitment to "help children grow and develop with their full potential." To this end, they have set out to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens partners like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of the social injustice of malnutrition," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition," told the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after having carried out more than 5000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
a collaborator of Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have already achieved, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances that we will have at this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade on Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretariat
"If necessary," Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, as published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is merely a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the most southern supplier in Europe," he said.
Moreover, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
"The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up in the market," he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the "energy consumer voice" in the United States.
In it, he compared Washington's approaches in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels," he warned while indicating that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relieve it of function to Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a Moscow hostage.
Moscow has always insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is worth $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is purely economic and is yet another sign of unfair competition.
"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russia's Energy Minister, Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Energy Secretary, last September in Moscow.
The American position has, however, been met with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The industry-leading organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully analyze the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she will consider joining the presidential race after the mid-term elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being posed.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally have women among the leaders," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I'm going to seriously consider running for president."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a City Hall appearance and stated that "he was leading the country the wrong way."
"I'm really worried about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren stated that "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
On Thursday, a poll was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that he should run for the 2020 elections.
58% of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not appear, according to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents did, however, support his candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said it would be officially decided in January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"The situation my son is going through, because of everything that has happened since he came back, is well known to the other families who suffer from the effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return to," he told the public that he gathered in a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "come back with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is that respect for what his fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to his country."
On Monday he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial recourse to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a "friendly" paper on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name has not been disclosed in the "Grace v. Sessions" case filed in August by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision taken by the Migration Appeals Board (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
District Attorney General Karl Racine made statements on Friday stating that the new policy "ignored decades of international, federal and state law."
"According to federal law, all applications for asylum must be ruled by virtue of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, on the other hand, this exception violates this principle," is indicated in amicus curiae.
In addition, lawyers stated in the paper that policy denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by claiming that they often become entrepreneurs more often and "suppose a necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People who leave their countries of origin on grounds of persecution or threats based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or a particular political opinion may apply for asylum," Sessions said when he announced this directive on 11 June.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, faced by people around the world on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll increases in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly dire.
"The situation is very tense," Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her baby with fever in an evacuation center from the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances with more bodies arrive.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search among the few leftover belongings in an effort to recover whatever they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, whose back and shoulder were broken, rested on the outside of Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to continuous, also very strong, replicas.
He couldn't help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake that he lived while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to get safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the ruined wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
"I heard my wife asking for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propagandistic announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's payment supplement at the Des Moines Register, Iowa's most-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, something China strongly denies.
Trump's accusation of Beijing's attempt to influence the US elections marked what U.S. officials indicated to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war that has led to higher tariff levels on imports from both sides.
China's compensatory tariffs that were applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall to exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an op-ed at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is further intensifying this pressure with advertising publications in our free press."
"To try to spread their propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's cherished tradition of free speech and free press by attempting to publish a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that their country's economy is taking, as the media is controlled by the strong pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most relevant newspapers in China eluded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts point out that Republicans are distanced from women before the mid-term vote with Kavanaugh's debacle
As there are many renowned Republicans who are closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there can be a setback, especially for women, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have said they want to move forward with the vote.
"It is not possible to back down on this kind of matter," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher claimed to doubt that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s latest attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm voters disgusted with this issue.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters who gathered at the Senate gates sang "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) at the time when Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation go out of proportion," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
"People say the repercussion is already very relevant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the undecided women in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29, who don't usually vote even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which he detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that there could be a setback if the Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
"This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just a question of the committee voting or the final vote anymore, not even of whether Kavanaugh is on the bench; it's also about the way Republicans have handled all this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priority USA (a group that helps in the election of Democrats) told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who they should believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more take the side of the latter.
In a new YouGov survey, it is indicated that 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony in a definitive or probable way, while 35% claim to believe Kavanaugh in a definitive or probable way.
In addition, 38% claimed that they thought that Kavanaugh had, in all probability or definitively, lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while drunk at the age of 17.
For his part, Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitalia at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest technology legend project, a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world."
"It has to be now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable users to create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique in personal online data storage is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
For the time being, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers from around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a radical change where all their business models are completely modified overnight.
"We're not asking permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Even though he is launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew that he had been granted the greatest British military honour.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the decoration of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons."
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage", pushed the line forward before reaching a cannon with one hand and toppling three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, only a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so great that I will never be able to live up to him, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a wreath of flowers after the parade, which featured the band Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evident when he is shown such a large backing."
MMA supporters were up all night for Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to watch the whole Bellator 206 so they won't let you see the main event in the end.
The San Jose cartel had 13 fights, six of which were included on the main card, and in the UK it was to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 pm, just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers were stunned when the program switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay awake until early in the morning just to see the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the shift to cartoons as "a heavy joke."
"There is a government regulation that regulates the content that is broadcast from 6 a.m. and this was not adequate, so they had to switch to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Peppa la pigita," yes.
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said they will modify the program to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
"When I think about the broadcast option, I think it can work," Coker said.
"But it's at 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we have normally done. We try to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we passed.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumphant.
At 24, he told us that he didn't realize until he got to high school that "they weren't all like me."
In the first Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that her intention in talking about gay rights was to convey "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him begin to downplay the fact of winning in the Olympics.
The usual host of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, is going to be absent for a few months because of illness.
In Laverne's first program, Daley, who showed himself as an outcast, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "you didn't accept socially that you liked boys and girls."
He said, "Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to convey that "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion declared that it was a surprise for him too to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year to the winner of an Oscar, which takes him 20 years, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you've lived so long since you were so young" (he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June who was named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
"If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have revolved around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had the passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I wasn't able to tell him I wasn't going to be in the front row," he said.
"I had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until that very moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At the time I knew that that was what I had dreamed all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine in an Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He was still skinned as a hen.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low shape, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to prevent it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years to get a record for 12th time, was unbanked by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has done so many times for the United States, the five-time majors tournament champion had to settle for cheering up in a few moments and, in others, trying to perfect his game in the field so that he could rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct driver, not even at the highest moment of his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best form for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough continually punishes with wrong strokes.
And, if the field is no longer daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth game, is facing British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below at the start of the 12 individual games, started off in an impressive way, Mickelson's game could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, neither could he say much more.
"He understood the role he had today perfectly, patted me on the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's brand of more games played by the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cups trajectory that had never so clearly matched the levels of their individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost and 7 the same, although Furyk said his presence brought much more intangible values to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, resourceful, he likes to make fun of others; it's great to have him on the team," he explained.
"I think younger players have loved having it as support, also this week; it was fun.
It brings a lot more than just playing."
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish off the others by stepping on their heels for a minimum margin, earning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but for very little," said Bjorn, portrayed, after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no more or less, than the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players have done on a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to go ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual performances and this is different.
It's great to share what happens with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you test your entire ability as a golfer.
That's the message that needs to be passed on to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it's time to put aside your partner, go and get the best out of yourself."
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do it better individually than they did as couples, with exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, which added three points of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends in the last days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that won in Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe held the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super-important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole route," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but it will not be done until at least next year due to faulty systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that heads the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, a statement by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery screwed up the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and very small acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuous delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) to be out of date by the time they start serving, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate held headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It has been the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent to a combat mission.
The deficiencies in software were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors: half of the personnel in the former Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as other ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), instead of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is "leaving without ships capable of deploying."
The officer said that the problem has become worse over time, because the old ships were discharged, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything that is found is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide the upcoming conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common bats and sopranos, as well as the coastal bats of Daubenton and long-eared browns of the Inverewe Gardens on Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds that are collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of calls of bats and which species do.
A report and a habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind,
but, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts in the field, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and, at times, rescues.
The organization has opened even the first and only reserve dedicated to bats from Scotland in the state of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to better understand what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, since a breeding colony could be destroyed inadvertently and 400 females and young could be killed, which would mean annihilating an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species about which we don't know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape at the same time as his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled rape allegations as "fake news," and says people "want to make themselves known" at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
Portugal and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is charged with paying $375,000 to hide the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, called the report "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball looking at the camera.
"They only want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same old story.
They want to become famous just by mentioning me, but I can't help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations that appear in what they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will try to get compensation for "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents recorded in the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and had let him down that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of the wounds at the hospital, but later agreed to reach an out-of-court settlement because he was "terror to reprisals" and worried "to be humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is trying to annul the agreement, as she remains traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he switched to Juve, a large Italian football player for a contract of €100 million.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret it all its life" if it lost its position as a world leader in automobile manufacturing after Brexit, said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" for Toyota UK to inform the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production would temporarily stop at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays in customs in the case of a Brexit without agreement could result in loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that, if Britain breaks up with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed their fears about exiting the EU without an agreement, particularly in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns to which car manufacturers refer revolve around the problems that could arise in assembly chains in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is based on the adjusted production mode (just in time or at the last moment), where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to manufacture cars on demand.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there could be an interruption at the border which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than a day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said and, in that case, production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan, which establishes future relations with the EU, is "precisely calibrated to avoid such controls at border crossing points".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that not only allows us to get out of the way right now, but we need to seize the opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful set of supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would stop, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and, ultimately, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover."
A government spokesman said, "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan to define our future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "put on another week," as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump's aid and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Expectation about whether Trump decides to fire the deputy general or not and thus compromise Mueller's independence has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone he himself was wearing to try to relegate the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, among news reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was then at the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the vote in the full Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been defined, it could be this week or another, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the march and inform the press, as I usually do."
Some journalists would refute that statement: Sanders has not held any press conferences in the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting with grandeur, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they boast."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him," he said, while quoting without proof: "We have contrasted those numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking the president of the United States directly, I think it's much better than doing them to me.
We tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only occur on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why this was the case, where he made an unspeakable and sometimes bizarre appearance before the journalists who were gathered there.
State Secretary for Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland's HHS to express the country's gratitude and its desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit in which they chose to make the decisions expected this autumn have continued.
However, the UK government has also intensified preparations around a possible scenario where there was no agreement.
I know all this must be very disconcerting to you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that reinforce and improve the work of the health service, from which patients and communities we serve benefit.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to count on you."
Christion Abercrombie is having emergency surgery after a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player, was surgically operated on after a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennesse reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed informed reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the band and collapsed right there," Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing him on a stretcher and leading him to a thorough examination.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding a total of 18 tackles throughout the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher transfer tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be charged a higher transfer tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money that is collected with this measure will be used to shelter the "homeless", according to the new plans of the Conservatives
Change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the farm transfer tax will be imposed on persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year that will go to homeless people.
The additional money that is raised with the increase in the tax of transfer of estates to foreign buyers of properties in the UK will go to aid to the "homeless", announced today Theresa May.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and harassment those with higher incomes.
The increase in the farm transfer tax will be levied on people and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to encourage government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including also the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of newly constructed properties in London are bought by people who are not resident in the United Kingdom, leading to higher prices and making it difficult for people who buy for the first time to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas (especially in the capital) have become "phantom cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of maintaining very high prices on property by eagerly buying land without intent to use it and urged Mrs May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the "shameful housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of evictions for no reason.
It also proposes to give the local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become too difficult for many people to reach and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's coach says his "primordial goal" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about the possibility of reviving the northeastern club, which currently holds third place in the League One (the third league division of England), three points from the first.
He passed the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap," Ross told Sportssound at BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it's something that's always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland leader include Dick Advocates, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he went on to such established names in such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Right now, success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can return to the club where it should be."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a time as an assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts technical corps.
Later, he helped the Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made the St. Mirren move from being on the edge of the descent to winning the championship in the following season.
In fact, Ross claims to be more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
"I always thought management was the best thing I could do, much more than play.
It may sound weird, because it was good, I could make a very good living with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that job; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train and now I've managed to do it, it's the time of my adult life that I've felt better, without a doubt."

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits fell by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consulting firm, which collected the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England remains in the World Cup have still kept the pattern of the previous month of June in July, in which the pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, although the restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8 % drop in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered from heat, although not as drastic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, sales of drinks rose by up to 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman of RSM's hospitality and leisure analysts said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the out-of-home activity market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year will be particularly painful in view of continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand implantations.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK's restaurant, bar and pub sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 business groups, with combined turnover of more than £9 billion and is the market reference value.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media behind their parents' backs
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret accounts on social media behind the backs of their parents and teachers, according to a survey
The survey, conducted to 20,000 high school students, revealed a growth on the fake Instagram pages
News has exacerbated fears that sexual content will be published
20% of students claimed to have a "main" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a landmark photo sharing site.
The news has exacerbated fears that sexual content will be published.
20% of students said they had a healthy "main" account showing their parents, while having private ones.
A mother who happened to meet her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw a teenager encourage others to "rape me."
The research, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmitresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletics federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish athletics federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the administrative body.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning track and field athlete and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim that the sport will benefit from their great international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from having her in its directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I like to be the spokesperson for athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert at the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or to what extent I would.
It's been exhausting, but I managed to fully recover, I had to learn to walk again and I'm currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The advertisement of the breast pump where mothers with cows are compared divides opinion on the Internet
A milking company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing mothers who breastfeed with cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what is theoretically the "first silent breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music showing some mothers who tell them the freedom given them by the new milk extractor.
Four royal women dance in a barn full of hay as a dance floor, along with cows, with lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but I have no tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they are not udders, they are my breasts".
The choir goes on to say, "Ordelalas, milk them, I'm feeding your babies, milk them, milk them, I'm milking my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has created a great controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it succeeds in focusing on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth in order to produce milk, with the exception that they are taken from their babies days after giving birth," wrote one person.
The Elvie milk extractor adapts discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce a milk extractor for mothers who do keep their babies?"
Another comment was, "What a crazy ad."
Other people, however, defended the announcement, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "detonating".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'm sure I'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I don't give it any more thought.
It's a product genius," one woman told us.
Another person commented: "It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector."
In the end video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump out milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly attached inside the breast-feeding bra, which makes its users able to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, tells us: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of breast-feeding pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and close manner the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new bomb.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has appeared in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded along the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant minors quietly displaced to a Texas border camp
The number of detained immigrant minors has increased considerably, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has almost remained at the usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to take a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
In their efforts to prosecute minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to be brought before the court within a maximum of one month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers in the reception centres.
Many of them will testify via videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for amparo shall be deported as soon as possible.
According to the shelter workers and the system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to flee.
According to defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
In addition, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could give them trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "occupation forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the country’s war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 ground soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the right conditions were in place for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault on Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had a "clear time frame" and has expressed the hope that the military action will focus on the jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who "will be eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy of the UN, hopes shortly to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be "restricted to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, a dismissal or a scandal will prematurely end his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, peak hour rates have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and have nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak times, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed cable channel rates with 3.5 million viewers for major night news programs.
"It's a strange attraction that we still can't understand," says Neal Baer, author-producer of "Designated Survivor," an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride he made in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cabbie told him he'd vote for Trump.
Why? He asked her.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos are always rising in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else seen on television, arguments emerging from Washington could determine the future of the Roe v.Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families can get together, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information goes beyond limits when you realize that you've been seeing a panel of experts discussing the use of the "deep back" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000 dollar ostrich leather hunter ("a garment of disproportionate pride," in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's gruesome descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"By offering something new every night, it's in part what makes everything look like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, when he talks about the alternating cast of Trump's show and its daily twists of the plot (either entering a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, he was on a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was a refugee inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not take off from the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to confront the Senate Judicial Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
"I remember when in those days we were doing all those crazy programs and people were telling us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss tells me.
"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right."

Foreign money flows in the tighter mid-term elections of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that the influx of money is coming to Pennsylvania's 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a Congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, whose structure was recently redesigned, has Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another re-election candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, a district that overlaps to a large extent with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a campaign funding contest among the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, although after it reversed
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to bring back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of about 140 million US dollars 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and criminality.
As the internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that their intention was to move the conference forward, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence intends to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, as diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has attached to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys calmly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with the internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next planned step could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is already considerable evidence on the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also leading this investigation into the possibility that Trump's campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable before that chamber, just as he prepares to stand again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionals, and with it I do not suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the contest.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler. It was only necessary that the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has seen himself in a good one since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will find a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador's house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the encounter against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play home Thursday against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive tie in Spain against the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from achieving his first appearance of the season until the 2-to-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"We got a good point, since Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We started the game thinking we could get something and we went out with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved victory in the end, but in general, the tie was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out for all and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope that we can achieve all three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have already achieved a good result in the previous match. But, with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard with my injuries and changes at the club itself, but now you notice a general atmosphere that everything will go well.
The team is fine, the guys are enjoying themselves a lot and we're having a good workout.
I hope that we will be able to move forward, leave behind last season and achieve success."
Fear of retirement savings is making some women lose sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talk about this with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about this.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they're not taking steps to have this conversation," Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance Company Nationwide, tells us.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family to take care of you if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to receive care, as these options can be a determining factor in cost.
Incorporate in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-valued hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or secure yourself with your own savings, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: go ahead to the legal battles.
Be sure to obtain a power of medical care to designate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and to ensure that professionals comply with their own wishes in case they cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a power of attorney for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always ready.
"It's not just finance that's at stake: what doctors should we deal with?" asks Martin.
"What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to have everything planned out."
Several times they shoot a man with a carbine in Ilfracombe
They've shot a man with a carbine several times as he walked home after he left at night.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
Their injuries were not fatal and the police had appealed to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
With communications blocked, aid officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically inferior administrative region to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit West Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, an area of high seismic activity, and is often affected by earthquakes.
Below are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic remembering the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of major earthquakes that caused the death of more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, a 29-year-old citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report released on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to that police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin has been ordered remand in custody in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held with an unsecured bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He presented himself to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "definitely innocent" when asked for his statement, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a misdemeanour of Class B, with a one-day prison sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering in the reporting of a domestic violence crime, and possessing an intoxicated weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he punched him in the face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of Deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 magnitude caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the centre of Sulawesi, which is located north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that circulate on social networks and show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are looking for capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan last October, tearing down the pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to request a death penalty, filed in the South District of New York.
The two charges entail a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed a 22-charge indictment with Saipov that included eight counts of murder with the help of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", is specified in the intent notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York City, he went to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be raised in his hospital room, the police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilt with a life sentence with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously requested prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory says NIgel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should take over negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK "would have been out by now" had Farage been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge that Prime Minister May faces to reconcile her divided ranks has even more highlighted when a group of Tories in favor of permanence have joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep up the plan of the compromise that was signed in Chequers amid the attacks of pro-Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
Deputy Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left," he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added, "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and we want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: "I'm just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like Chequers' plan, the opposition will not vote in favour and is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget Chequers and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: Prime Ministers hold office when they keep their promises."
Farage told the concentrates that politicians would have to "feel the heat" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We will mobilize the people's army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, pro-stayers toured the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists were waving Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labourman Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they had with an application of the party during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus, for the borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all possibilities of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all possibilities of running for the presidency" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a city meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who co-chaired Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes a woman at the top."
One arrested for the murder with a gun of LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge (Luisiana) police announced this Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head that finally caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and got shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the crime scene, in possession of a gun, and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 1.98-meter-high player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting in 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton to oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter pits and let Hamilton run in the band's tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out hard a lap later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after an action with the wheels almost stuck that made the Ferrari driver have to leave the interior reluctantly free at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 that day, started from the last row of the grill and got into seventh place at the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race as he clung to his tires to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen to fourth.
Finally, he entered boxes in round 44, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by regaining Raikkonen in fourth position.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me through.
The team has done exceptional work to get a perfect match," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, disgusting and false."
"The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false," he said.
"When you read the publications and leaks, and then they say, "But I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked it," he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did."
But his refusal didn't seem to suit the president, who during Saturday night's rally commented: "I'll tell you one thing: that was a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense to the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president as Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back on Saturday by 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial lead of two goals thanks to attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie won the local tie before Dwyer restored the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard scored for the Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who came from beating the Dundee by 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to Kendall McFaulll's attendance, while David Rutherford provided assistance for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan again put the local team eager to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to match the game in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first part.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched the match with a golazo in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game when the end of the second part came and secured victory with their team's fifth goal as the final came up.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so hundreds of people can escape on the plane from the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and there are many missing after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to hit the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his companions fled to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport control tower. The tower was being hit by a strong swing.
It remained firm to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australian channel ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death toll may reach several thousand people.The national disaster mitigation agency claims that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many corpses under the ruins and many people have not been contacted," says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, who will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance with more bodies arrives.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the Indonesian army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after having said that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the sinking plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon he could not notice a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital..
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's an extremely good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who were doing nearby dock upgrading work also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Aviation safety network data indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none have died with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution completed the presentation of their arguments on Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He exposed to the jury how he used mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, thus contradicting his earlier statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers' phone during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been to the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "liaring, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin their closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would remain in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
Bristol's High Breed claims that hip hop moved away from its origins from political messages and from addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Interpreters such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a "racist" text.
A New York nanny is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after wrongly receiving a text message from the mother complaining she was "another black person."
The couple denies that it is racist and compares the lawsuit to a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her dismay at finding that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she reached her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK PERSON," Ms.Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her screw-up, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice claiming that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a lousy job and instead expected a Filipino, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for one day's work and sent her home to Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving a compensation of $350 a day for the six-month internal work position for which he had been hired, though without a contract.
"I want to show you that things aren't done that way," he told The Post on Friday and added, "I know it's a discrimination case."
The couple responded to claims that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable thing, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her after having offended her.
"My wife had sent him something he didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the lawsuit as an "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to go get someone that way?
That's not that it's a very decent thing," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was difficult to put herself in the place of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's so funny to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
Having said that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, trusted that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was somewhat "sweet-sweet" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to brag," he said.
"But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who accomplishes something important: you are proud of him, even if it is not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was urgently transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that the situation was really wrong, that he was not expected to succeed," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to maintain the pumping of his heart slowly ran out and left his system.
She had died before the time and everything was going out.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not howl, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, alien to the terrible experience that was going on.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I bent my head and tears fell on me all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicides are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile lit up anywhere."
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly concerned that it might have repercussions."
Davis created the cards "so people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't sit quietly, you have to talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he was depressed or anything," he tells us.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed your change of attitude.
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: "It leaves a void in the whole family.
He's wrecked us.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs by a thread at the time the FBI begins the investigation
"I thought that if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a limited investigation in time, limited in scope), maybe we could bring in a little unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "getting on the ground" in the middle of a partisan freeze.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigation to take place?
His refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
There are only five weeks to go before the mid-term elections on November 6. If, as expected, Republicans have bad results, their attempts to achieve the election of the man they want for the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President’s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defectors figures "fall" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said last year there were 1,127 desertions, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs charged by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments in this regard.
The vast majority of deserters from the north are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says they have illegally crossed the border over 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considered deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and were often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who generally agreed to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will by no means be the first to unilaterally disarm," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, said that the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "historic" and that he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Austin Festival (Texas).
"I can't help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the accusations against them "grotesque and clearly coordinated defamations" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed his bias against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and that the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, you won't be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, you won't even be able to be in the court you're in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible sentences against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe v.Wade case, as he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and wait for us to think everything is all right," Pelosi said.
And women have to handle it.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of rage overflowing, and she can't let go without crying.
"We cried when we got angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's that weird, do I?"
She kept talking: "A woman who was an executive in some company helped me a lot and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
No, I'm angry."
And then I kept going with what I was doing.
I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out for rabies in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once that I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the throat and dragged me to a ladder.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he said.
"They have no idea you're furious.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've cornered you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Colorado Democratic Congresswoman, had worked with Gary Hart in her presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business, by which she had to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came to think that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would run for president.
"It wasn't a well-premeditated decision," he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the seven dwarfs."
As the campaign was already well advanced, he stayed behind in fund-raising, so it was promised that he would not enter the race again unless he raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000, only gave her $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When she delivered her speech to announce that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration at a system that made fundraising difficult and focused on attracting voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
"It would have been logical to think he had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said recalling the reaction of the press.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my tombstone?
"He cried"?
The US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first saves of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although much remains to end the battle, a break between countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by putting tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£15 billion) in products, which carries taxes on half of the products entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent reprisals, recently applying five to ten percent tariffs to US products worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to matching US attacks, and the second most powerful economy in the world is unlikely to slow down soon.
Getting Washington back would mean giving in to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could help China positively in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make it possible for the conditions to start an economic downturn in either of the two countries is actually far more dangerous than viewers have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, Asia-focused associate researcher for the Center for New American Security strategic cabinet.
Syria is ready for the refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria states that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions were improving.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods are already in place.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted insurgency.
Europe takes over the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris (France).
The United States now has six consecutive losses on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the 14.5 points necessary to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water in the 16 par 3 hole, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 against the player with the lowest rating on the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one player Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanishman Sergio García, a veteran who has already had eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most victories of the tournament of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very hard year.
I'm totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy that I was able to get my drink back.
It's an achievement for the whole team and I'm so glad I could help," said an excited Garcia after the European team's victory.
Now he passes the torch to his fellow countryman John Rahm, who already defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday by 2 and 1 in a singles match.
"I feel incredible pride in having defeated Tiger Woods, as I have grown up seeing this man," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, remaining only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a time this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we spoiled it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We'll regroup, I'll meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys so much and I'm proud to be their captain.
Now it's our turn to bend our heads.
We've been outnumbered."
