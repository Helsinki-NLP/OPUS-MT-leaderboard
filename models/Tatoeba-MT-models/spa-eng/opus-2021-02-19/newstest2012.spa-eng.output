Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Penal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former Prime Minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia disadvantageous for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet final, the appellate court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, which sentenced the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
For approval, 226 votes were required.
Libya’s Victory
The story of Libyan liberation, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
It remains to be defined who is the winner
As usual in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of elucidating whether they are moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional sharia law, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, made up of warring tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya, an order will be established that we cannot imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and it was probably not in the interests of the Libyans mentioned above.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters accepted gratefully the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, the NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When they seek victors in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shooting by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, it is not a problem for the locals to expel the "crossings"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies get the Libyan black gold just in good words?
It is quite possible that not, but it may be that the West can finally presume to protect human rights.
As long as the followers of the sharia don't come across us.
A New Era of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe go hunting for the investor seeker
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarterly period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors no longer look only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
Both countries have made public the data for the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of expected 0.1 %), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1 % (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the inter-quarterly period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to ČSU, the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic development growth is shaping.
The results are even worse than analysts' forecasts.
Main events:
On an annual basis, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated four-yearly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest on their ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on ten-year Czech bonds remains at 4%, although the situation in the area is worsening.
In Germany there are voices saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
Czechs are classified for the Euro Cup.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a 200 million bonus.
The football team fulfills the hardest task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended itself fantastically against the attacks of the local team, so it will not miss the European championship date.
IHNED.cz followed the party's development in detail in a detailed report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two victims of the party were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who allowed two great occasions to pass.
In addition, thanks to the brilliant Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup, so that the coffers of national football will receive an approximate gratification of 200 million crowns.
Already from the first few minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams only tried to maintain the lines and played just around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, patadones to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture, they wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying Tuesday at noon before the facilities and then chanted death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan human shields around the nuclear technology center where uranium is worked.
They intend to show that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is striving for nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon before the nuclear facilities in Isfahan and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, Israeli sources said that not only the Isfahan plant but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would be reached.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity affects 5 per cent.
Obese children come mostly from families with a lifestyle that is unhealthy, according to current research.
It again demonstrates the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference.
At the table, obsessing children feed, for example, on sausages at least twice as often as children from normal weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten fries the day before the test, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence".
In families of overweight children there is no practice of sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and nearly 900 basic education children from all over the Czech Republic participated in the survey.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a chance", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from 4th to 8th grade.
A proper diet and plenty of exercise in the family are determining factors, which make the number of overweight and even obese children significantly decrease.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals a day according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," picks up one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with lunch for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, the details, which also count, are also important, such as having a fixed hour for breakfast as a family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of families of schoolchildren have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one has breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households nothing is eaten.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that families of obese children are much more often consumed by unhealthy potato chips.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink daily soft drinks (70%).
As a rule, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed do sports, but among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make up your diet
The next phase of the study made it possible for the chosen children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal."
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"The popularity of soft drinks is particularly alarming," the study's final report warns.
As the main food, the pasta is taken from the palm and followed closely by the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject the legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, who completed the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", in many cases there was a significant change in favor of the principles of a healthy diet", it is pointed out in the results of the study.
Attention is drawn, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also more frequently choose poultry meat and fish for the main meal in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals maintain
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, how to dress up problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the entertainment world.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
This time we have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone's short-necked, someone's got a stylized figure without the right curves and someone's overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of Jennifer Lopez's type women, with huge breasts and hips but tight waist and at the same time not to dress it in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth sewing at least one extra piece of tailor-made fabric.
You will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are unpayable.
With a custom skirt you will feel much better than with one that keeps moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
Stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or draped.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am happy that I have all week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who will have to design two changing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
The current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question, must be taken into account.
It's been my turn to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Screaming inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gómez.
Dresses we have to trim them from magazines or search them online and print them, and then make them graphically.
Moodboard, which is what the full result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, does not wear only physically, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (for specific topics such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about all this.
But all this is up for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information on all types of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a coat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in classics with jeans and T-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body in heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just roll it up and up your neck to get a completely different image.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to first know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
It is finally clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this has to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style suppose themselves, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, for the time being, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters find it useless too (I have enough skills, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we should keep in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate a size very different from your real (minor) size.
Then it is only left to gugle and to find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained weight / thinning, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to focus on fashion, but he has to understand outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss them, he defends their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and complete it with pretty clothes, you can't take and throw away everything there was and say, "I'm so awful."
"Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend so someone can put them on," says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
It is fixed around the waist and has all the necessary tools there.
They are objects such as scissors, scissors, brush removers, or must-haves. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as handbags or hats), special grippers of garments in front, if it were larger (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing set.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the soles of the shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and much more the outside.
And we did nothing but clothe and clothe.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So you had to be very skillful.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I'm not very good at those skills.
This is just a small part of everything we've heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that professional styling is not a path of rose, but I don't care exactly what people say.
Need for Speed: The Run competes across America.
Overview
A trip, initially carefree, is complicated by a series of improper carelessness of a routine journey during tomorrow's shift.
To some extent, expectations were met, but this is of no use if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was meant to be done.
The new installment, to which the title is added The Run, raised high expectations already before its premiere.
He promised that he would give new airs to the old racing series Need for Speed and, as a result of what was shown, appears as a game that should not end up being a genre of action again.
We are also curious to know how the scenes inserted would look, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As usually happens in NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are careers that can be considered acceptable, but in total computation points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In reality, mistakes cannot and cannot be called mistakes, but rather the incomprehensible sluggishness of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit at the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
That way, you don't even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries in the series.
It is therefore nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
In the mountains, however, care must be taken not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of rivals (normally in a classic race), then you try to buy time (classic timed duel) and then a duel awaits you against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this sometimes the police appear, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than would be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context mentioned above, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the traces of the previous episodes.
That means that it is no longer a big deal today, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race conceived with quite a lot of action suits this style of driving, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, so good.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correctness of driving models, collisions are no longer the same.
From games of this type you can't expect it to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very tight run or driving the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or it even ends up totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or get off the track, the game restores you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five resets are available in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something doesn't go well, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, not even reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or you arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or stop.
It's the same when you get here, because it's programmed because the "surprise" will always happen right under your nose.
Opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will arrive at places where, without taking into account the moment, the same adversary will always advance you in the same place.
This also happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come in front of you, so at first you can mash the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it surely disappoints you immediately.
And it is a shame, because even if the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it is often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that boredom doesn't fit, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to keep an eye on the gas pumps by the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic supersports for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are careers in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
As you reach the upper level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending up with profile funds.
At the same time, there is an online Autolog function, which compares your results to those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the tunnel of the metro (pass), where you run in the dark along the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and suddenly, from behind you comes the metro convoy and takes you straight ahead.
In the editorial we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game none even thought a bit or whether the authors actually take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
What a pity, then, that, in the most tense moments, image quality is reduced and, at times, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
Audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just because of his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble asserting that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It feels like the game isn't over.
Fun is assured, but get ready because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of airport reflectors.
The choirs of the University Carolina will participate in the concert "Terriper Students".
The joint celebration of International Student Day and the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution as a musical experience will take place for the third time at the Festa Academica festival.
During this event, twenty chorales from high schools and universities will be presented.
The festival revolves around two concerts on November 17.
"Caroline University has a high participation in the festival."
Among the current choirs are the choral of the Faculty of Pedagogy and the Faculty of Humanities, in the committee of the festival is the rector Václav Hampl", said the head of the organization, Jakub Čaloun.
The summit of the entire festival is the free entrance for all audiences to the concert of high school choirs, which will be held on March 17 at 2 p.m. in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program has the participation of Czech jazz player Karel Rička and his Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evening, the concert "Students of Velvet" will be held at the venues of the Municipal House in Vynohrady, with the participation of university chorals, including the chorus of the Carolina Uninversity.
The Academic Festa aims not only to celebrate the International Day of Students with dignity and to remember the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music to the public at the highest level and to promote collaborative creation among young people.

The EU Ambassador, Vicenová:
Czechs have a reputation as negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between the individual institutions"
"I wasn't expecting an all-out war to take place."
"It will last five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," so began his lecture at the Faculty of Law, Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, with conviction.
How not to take seriously his slogan "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers of the School of Law of the U. Carolina.
Vicenová also pondered the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first comes the criticisms, that if it is insultous, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I have to say that it left everyone bewildered, because it assumes its roles to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position of representative of foreign policy and security is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union vis-à-vis states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban Olomouc's cheese from us.
Vicenová has also taken care of the agenda continued, continues and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU has many commitments for the time being.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good fuss", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being addressed now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive the most support and which less? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly".
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, foreignisms or slang that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not actually invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speed awaits us
According to the ambassador, Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
It also regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is on a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says to me, "What, you are, those of the Visegrad Group?"
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, is awaiting harsh new fiscal policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real about the concept of two speeds, if not more, in Europe than the new 'European Federation'.
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don't, that stay out."
"These procedures will increasingly strengthen the two-speed Europe", Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in applying the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed between member states, not just among Eurozone members.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were to look for a term that defined IBM's strategy with great precision, the most approximate would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet a hundred years have passed since its foundation.
The basis of this long-term character was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson.
He has already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his label, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised corporate culture.
"For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fearing the changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century," said the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano during his anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the businessman of Baa in the Czech Republic (the employees of IBM were among the first American operators to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in its relationship with the customer.
Already from the beginning the company was able to discover talents (as one of the first global companies to end any discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM's current plan, whereby Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
In recent years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual encounters, brainstorming online, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
Not surprisingly, almost half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained an institution rather than a technology company concept," says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the US familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies in the last hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It hosts the largest number of patents from all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, bar codes and floppy disks.
IBM will bill this year $220 billion. This year it has become the second technology firm for market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first outnumbered Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, you cannot anchor emotionally in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
That's why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don't work, abandons them).
And that's the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which about one fifth are software and another fifth are equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the suppliers' share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets for a total value of $15 billion. Over the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis was manifested for the first time.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far IBM has been able to weather the crisis.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.
IBM's currency is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from the cheese cutter to space flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York 100 years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - originally a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The basis that gave rise to the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He owned inventions such as the famous "log-in clock", which allows controlling the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his supervisory council.
Flint signed the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The new leader overshadowed the founder of IBM ( Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business equipment, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson ran the company, turnover doubled by $9 million and began the company's great expansion across continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that after almost forty years occupying the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "peses", which established the computer standard of that time, arrived on the market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer complete advice and services of high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet."
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not improved, for example in terms of transport and city administration.
For the trading sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch office in Czechoslovakia then, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina remained hopeful that Josef would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but not as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové into her home during the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the petition, Iveta had not moved thirty days after ̄íčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Eventually, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, nobody will throw him out."
"But here I would live no longer as my dear old drunk who was wrong, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová said, adding that she had already unhooked herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't care that his wife has locked the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I spoke normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not oppose it.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, or where she goes, or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and took full responsibility," concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that make men boil their blood?
Shopping
Do you blame your half-orange who is dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one trapper a week?
Do you like to buy often in sales?
Then in your case it can be said that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to just walk through clothing stores, look for tight clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner to wait for her in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't these phrases ring a bell?
Isn't that right?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listening to their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning in the first place
It's like an infinite merry-go-round.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for stepping on the clean ground with a dirty foot, your children who have soiled a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that you had so much trouble cleaning?
In case you suffer from this "diversion", prove to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should surely not occupy primordial in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Making Distasteful Comments
"Used underpants are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to put those socks on tomorrow too"
"Wet cloth is not left on the ground!"
If you make those cometaries to your partner more times a day, know that you'll get him out of your way.
You don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Calumnias and gossip
Some women also like slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how, and why.
Maybe every single one of us can get away with a little harmless gossip.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who do not control themselves, who love to gossip and do it often, despise everyone and are dangerous for those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jágr participated on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and put Czech players back in the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the play of the 39-year-old star, and took one step further and was declared best player of the game.
Two assists were awarded in the match and Jagr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I had already told him before the game that I would triple."
"I sensed it."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the first trace of the Flyers.
A while later the team's second intervention also had a Czech trail.
Voráček took the album behind the Hurricane goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot crashed through Wayne Simmonds' goal room.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player on the field, but he's definitely among the top three," Jágr posed to his headquarters.
"It never occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him."
"I'm very pleased with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my colleagues played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, of penalty, until he got to a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up outnumbered two to one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"It cleared the disk, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to hit the album and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third retired due to an injury to the upper body.
The Canadiens lost not only one player with a lot of defense experience, but also a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec couldn't take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and played the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels."
"Finally, but against that we can't do anything, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And so we leave gaps," explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were scored by five players who put an end to a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia at that time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time sold in most cases trips only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was severely restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime leaned west and the trips of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (that is, also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but one had to stand in line with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The Czechs' way of travel has suffered a genuine revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, that Croatia, the currently favorite destination, could not travel freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s, visa waivers were imposed for travel to neighbouring Western European States, resulting in an enormous wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see enough of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in the parks in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was the taking with them the food (conservatives, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy free Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and so did average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began, from 1997 on a regular basis, to prepare travel using charter connections, which led to an incredible drop in travel prices compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs were already travelling without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the US, which further simplified our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened as early as 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries depart every year. This winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries currently visit about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15 thousand Czech kroner per head on overseas trips, including expenses on the stay site.
Convened Ordinary General Assembly to elect the president, who could end up again in stalemate.
For almost five months Czech football has been without president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, agreement has not yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, one may not even vote to elect from among the three candidates.
Interested to preside over Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from his post in June not without convening his colleagues for the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the end of the Hašek era, a controversy broke out between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dđm), located in the Prague neighbourhood of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that point on, and because of this only point, there was a partial agreement, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed by the Executive Committee than, at its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically resolved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is this: how do we proceed in the third round to avoid deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of FAČR, who, from the leadership of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," this is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With this, surprisingly, Tomaš Paclík also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates are more in line with Pelta.
"I would like to see a vote as far as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense is invented about representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time and is directing his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be appeased with today's match of our national team at the European Championship.
"Football will be the protagonist again, and this will make it easier to cooperate," says the Jablonice representative, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at the professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that agreement will be reached, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It is not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"I hope common sense will prevail anyway," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts whether the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others the vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, according to them, will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the country's most powerful sports organization for an agreement to be reached.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) which will try to give a new direction to Czech sport following the financial problems of the Sazka Lottery House.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If Pilsen's head of footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), nor would he stand as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and not run for election."
"But to this day no such person has been found," Paclík said for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he were to win, he would remain in the post of president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I could take into account."
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that they don't even want to identify with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change that view," he adds.
What allegedly most annoys Paclík at this time is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Regional Football Association of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist capable of influencing the voting of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the current status will be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a wiretapping during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us," said Paclík, who also takes some caution in his earlier statement that "he would sell Club Pilsen if Pelta became president."
In the event of winning Thursday's elections, Paclík might consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Of the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation."
"but not as an association manager."
"I also don't stick my nose in where I don't feel able," added Paclík, who in September attracted a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the referee commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It is based on his management skills of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of the Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the victory in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some lobbyists, who probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it put pressure on political leaders to spend more money on sports from lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new president should devote himself."
"If the taxes on gambling were increased, as announced by the political parties, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to go," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with Club Pilsner, although he himself claims that the president of FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in hypocritically yielding my Pilsen Club shares to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would end the stalemate in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve, in the future, disputes regarding the electoral rules.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Even before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fund-raising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could do him well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People at all levels have been working on football for a long time and hope to meet the new President this Thursday."
"They feel it's time for someone to run the association," thinks the man who primarily associates with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the Association's executive committee.
For this reason, he thinks he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly approved the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to respond in case this fails."
"It's a matter of principles, without which we can't exist," Pelta says.
Besides, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he saw himself collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It has been a long time since he attacked Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with a head.
"He's been in the football world for over a year, and he's already achieved some successes."
"His attacks, but they were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains true to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the top.
The latter should be a showcase for football promotion.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately get involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal changes in the staffing table.
"I would first have to know the tasks of each employee," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in his career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, under his leadership, that FAČR would begin to work eagerly.
If the fourth General Assembly elected the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that if he were elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each football area individually.
It is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself entirely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
"By this I don't mean I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the competencies of the executive committee so that each member can devote himself to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me and hinder me at every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because then the others too would give up."
"It's about having faith so we don't just give up," he said.
They say he is also motivated to continue the work that has already begun with Hašek.
"During those two years, a lot of the work was finished that I don't want to miss now."
"There are processes that have been started and will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he announced worried that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be back to what it was before Hašek's time.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few chosen ones."
"I may be reproached for a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind doing my utmost for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech and one Moravian, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would not be the current situation in which we have only three Moravian teams, which represents a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential election struggle, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
"I am still sorry to have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and which knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include saving some tens of millions of crowns from disadvantageous contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"If he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already begun and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jumping into the blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible point of view, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those visiting Europe can experience their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbly baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something he couldn't miss in his luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying on her back on the water, she looked at the artistic dome on top, swam towards the marble angels, who waited for her at the edge of the pool and was amazed at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
He wants nothing to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers him that bath fans have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while running enthusiasts can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the joyous birds trills in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The splash in the pool and the ethereal sauna oils. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, the indoor pools can be a real gift to the view: "Instead of soil, in the bathrooms you have a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything bends optically: high vaults, colored tiles, trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting information about the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, there are nitrate waters in a unique karstic cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as hot springs, whose pools are alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many discovered pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts its eyes on Zurich's roofed pool, you can look at Arlberb, snow-covered, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal's water cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open fountains steam rises in winter, while from the bottom the mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, didn't get the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people think they have come to a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose legame sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a special enjoyment of well-being.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit uncovered swimming pools and sunbaths in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, he encountered a blocked terrain.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weeds grow between the tiles.
The decline countered in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; not only can you discover neo-Roman elements of the times of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall of Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural from the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to verify the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to one study, that 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that gambling on global commodity exchanges raises prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer advocate campaign specifically targets Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, raw material bets were thought to protect traders from price fluctuations.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled from offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report on the consequences.
In the end there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann's trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Rising food-price bets show in a particularly drastic way how ruthless banks currently harm public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest bank lobbyist, especially in bonds.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which the money for food-price betting is put into play," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the subject of hungry people or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
The inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation, you can improve your image.
And he needs to be barely bothered by any possible losses, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were set.
Many customers of the bank showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
Forty-three percent would discourage such a bank from its acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and be changed to another institute.
The 21st house in Vienna
The transferred pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, was empty and collapsed.
Now it reopens as an exhibition house.
Modern postgerra architecture passions, clear shapes, glass halls, brave curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels of 1958 is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to date a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building flattened in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was built after the universal exhibition at Schweizer Garten next to the station in southern Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and within it was inaugurated a museum of the 20th century, it was called the "house 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
In spite of this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and decays more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery since 2007, made a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, an art ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookshop and also an office building.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he significantly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his move to Vienna in his change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The window profile of the glass façade was changed, a fiberglass reinforced insulating glass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the pavilion of Schwanzer.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly the way it used to be.
And all this with strict control by the memorial office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the memorial protection office," Krischanitz says and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "awaken the right consciousness".
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been a stroke of urban luck. The totally new and planned "central station neighborhood", with houses and offices, is located next to Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck will happen: House 21 could receive a boost from another construction by Krischanitz, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you can hear, negotiates with the city on a neighbouring location in Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package amounting to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of personnel must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the faults and delays of trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking a plan of internal crisis of the group, of the investments previewed until 2005 of a total of approximately 300 million euros.
For this to be achieved a better availability of vehicles and rail network even with an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train breakdowns and delays also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the breakage of an axle at the central station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays million dollar fines in the U.S.
After the tumult over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in an agreement, to end the struggles due to the bankruptcy of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA reprimands many large banks to induce credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged banks deep into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank admits no fault with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of NCUA, welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in the event of bankruptcy to protect customer investments.
The NCUA is attempting to reinstate the losses of millions that have arisen.
The agreements currently closed are its first type.
The regulator had also requested accounts from other large banks and in summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. housing bubble broke out in 2007, it led to the doom of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a difficult wind is currently blowing for American banks.
Investors and inspection have initiated countless trials to receive compensation or punish misdemeanours.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of lawsuits.
It disproves the 18 big international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a demand from the FHFA, which is businesses worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests heavily in the IBM Information Technology company.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far the big American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology as the forecasts of long-term development of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM's business report and changed his opinion about investing in the sector.
He must have understood much earlier that IBM offers services above all and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, a Warren Buffett investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett now unveiled on the CNBC economics station that has acquired shares of IBM worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the engagement so far.
He commended the leadership for addressing the ordinary benefits of the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative Information Technology services such as the operation of calculation centers.
The old computer pioneer of more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said he was investing only in companies whose businesses he understood.
By contrast, Buffett took advantage of the occasion on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 subsidiaries of its own, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his way of life is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of earning money has given him the nickname "Omaha's Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's stock stock went up one percent.
"The Blue Giant", as IBM is known, has a stock market value of over 220 billion dollars and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he does not want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat materializes
After the discovery of "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that rekindles.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs, tricks and Greeks between the years 2001 and 2006 have a background of the far right.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost who was thought to have died a long time ago came back, since the fire-like attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of violence from the extreme right against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned whether there is xenophobia in Germany.
The discovered ultra-right network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived again?" headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-right pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence of a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
Coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media like a slap: "The German Gift for the 50th Anniversary", says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
"It starts to smell bad," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He highlights that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behaviour of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are amazed that the German authorities have not looked much earlier for suspects in the circle of the ultra-right.
Some are the least rhetorical in terms of the drastic means: "From now on you lose, immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the whole network.", writes "Selen".
Which means that, if Germany's internal peace is in danger, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be cleared up in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the shortcomings of German politics after the attacks were criticized mainly, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the attack in the form of a fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the German Turks contribute with taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin about the legality of this country has since been.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time frank words are needed.
The bank of the Lake Zurich scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it's run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it became known that in 2013 he would start in a new and almost equally spectacular job: President of the administrative board of the big Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, commends Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops friendly remarks about his future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and let down 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, general manager of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the USB administrative board has since considered himself equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It has been known that Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the administrative council in May, not early 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and advisor and has had a period of adaptation surely necessary.
He suddenly takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved again that it deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it slips from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also clever, was combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's big banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later banker in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified USB as a model for a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To load with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course that some looked with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second best paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its mistaken investments, the UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from the UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, it was said how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitalized on a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to deliver the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS confessed more or less to helping with tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the administrative board.
And the exodus of clients' funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculations and in the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud.
And just as it was getting a little quieter again, just as the UBS was thought to be getting it again, this unfortunate operator story happens, an individual operator let down 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it revealed, apparently, this still doesn't work well with risk management in investment banking.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with the UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So came the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had long presented themselves, to be the guardians of the greatest goods in the world: no risk too great, however, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is only a little larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich's Bahnhofstraße Street, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry such as Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprungli confectionery.
Swiss banks have resided here for years: from the national bank, through the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks like Julius Bär.
You enter the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered in marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bench there is a large sign to indicate the "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the great Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
The UBS has become too big, he says, mainly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then the disaster came, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the jungle of high risk as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"On Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The Crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
What do you think?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank arises that, due to the merger, was too big for little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but asleep bank with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a big financial bike.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the administrative board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: The folly came before the case.
The employees of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of directors, at which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: To lower Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well for him.
In foreign exchange transactions and stock trading it was at the top.
However, the advisors of the companies in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the "fixed income" banking language, there is enormous compensation for the big banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine for titling American mortgage credits and then selling them, maintaining certain risks on its own account.
And also, like other banks, he looked for the downfall for a long time.
"In summer 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The positions at the UBS became projectible seats and are insecure to date.
Currently, who runs a big bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, to end investment banking, to concentrate on property management, to return to Swiss real estate.
The bank does not want to go this far (yet).
But investment banking needs to decline a lot, it is clear today.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitory solution, since the bank the bank separated surprisingly from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed himself: He must permanently direct the business of the UBS, the bank of Zurich announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
It abolishes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions I'm sure Axel Weber is currently asking.
So far, he's just saying that he'll first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The impending recession in Europe has given fear to American investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome are still inconclusive.
Industrial production slowed down on the continent stifles hopes of stabilising at its source a crisis caused by indebtedness.
General relief may not be imposed on the changes of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has been half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back to the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are on the sales list.

Companies produced 2 percent less in September than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat's statistical office.
Which created skepticism among American investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this caution, it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for the CNBC.
That is why, in his view, it is too early to invest in state borrowings or European banks.
Instead, it throws away a decade of old principles and enters the American technology sector.

Smart Grasses Spread in Cities
In many places the grava are considered "problem birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the gravajos belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities there are piles of complaints from neighbors about the filth and noise of the animals.
Although no means have appeared against the "troubled birds" so far.
Grajos no longer leave the cities, experts say at the first symposium on gravajos en Leer, East Frisia.
There specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grassland; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing building and falling trees that host them make it difficult for birds to live.
Grajos are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass kill the district's gravajos jumped to the negative headlines of the press.
Critics have described hunting animals through bird traps and killing with sticks as especially brutal.
"Ejecting them and driving them away in a normal way, nothing is achieved," said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting nests with water or throwing trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals deviate, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Expulsion is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem in the cities is not solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals away from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to resettle elsewhere.
"Informative panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against it in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a peak in the face with aplomb."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on Ascheberger's grass, where signs inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion about criticism of bird noise: "Everything is a form of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grasses not only exploit the resources to access schist bites, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked four grates to see how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they should drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larvae.
Without much training, they recognized with determination the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning grits had to solve a complicated problem.
Researchers placed a small cube with a moth larvae in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get to their prey with their beak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket on the tube shooter.
Three of the four staples got it on the first try.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the latest Euro 2012 tickets in the playoffs in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after 0-0 of the one-way party, made the five Euro Cup participations in a row.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs game back with outsider Montenegro, after the one-way match (2-0) made things clear.
Croatia did not allow him to be scored in 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals of Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the play-offs of the 2010 South African World Cup.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal began in a perfect way.
Ronaldo ran a free direct from more than 30 meters to get to the head at the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to score from afar and got 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not show up in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, English leader Manchester City put a head on the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek was right for the Czech Republic
Next, the collegiate Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark took a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the European deputy champion of 2004 clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth time in a row for the Euro Cup.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) also got lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal at Tomas Sivok's own door (9).
Montenegro had more possibilities with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the front turn, very right in the goal of Cech.
After the break, the Czechs had to protect the goalkeeper's largo of world fame, FC Seoul's striker escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink had to leave his seat on the third-party bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians celebrated their fourth participation in the Euro Cup final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance shot, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole. Attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball inside the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly assumed control.
After the break, Croatia did not let any goals be scored.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made room for Ivan Perisic, of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Eurocup
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate the first participation in the Euro Cup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who triumphed with the 4-0 in the one-way game prepared for a previous decision, took the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Keane had his first big chance.
From the first moment, the Estonian defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he went ahead.
After a defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and shot the ball across the line, getting 1-0.

Massacre at the personal level
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate story about World War I, "begins with a long personae dramatis of the kind that can make one drop his soul at his feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently rip this page off and turn it into your brand pages.
You will come to know these people very well in the novelist narrative of Mr. Englund, and this personae dramatis will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he rightly describes as "an anti-history work".
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and pain of battle "combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go mad, or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones add to the mix while others go out.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a correction to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench war on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" moves expertly through other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book fall on hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"Factlessness," observes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the offshore fleet.
Their stories have mostly been obtained from memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and coping with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says, "Substitutes, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about Sucedane food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed in ram fat (and finished off with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, he observes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are meant to do and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that smoky, snug cock."
Instead a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once one resigns oneself to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the audience," he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar "to a condemned person being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become more and more an economic competition," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The mass murderer eloquently and ideologically convinced in good clothing that executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both ignoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund speaks of soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade in gonococcal pus, which the soldiers buy and conjure with it their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often results in blindness for life."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war to "unusually uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels such as No New on the Front of Erich Maria Remarque, instead of integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction play.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he came from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a false step prior, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen the night of Monday through Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underlined how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department.
Episodes of recent weeks, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, could not be repeated, violating department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the "okupas".
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park from protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had prepared themselves to see how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking towards Zuccotti.
The officers increased the so-called disorder training - counter-terrorist measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," the person said, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
A reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged earlier after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who usually flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do so when the fewest number of people were in the park," he said.
Emergency Service Unit trucks with spotlights and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip junction with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before exiting.
Lights and pre-recorded messages rumbling from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their clear blue windbreaks, many protesters simply picked up their stuff and left.
No tent was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, allowing time for protesters to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering at the perimeter to enter if detentions were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for your safety.
But many journalists said that attempts were made to prevent the police from taking action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the dense tangle of protesters' personal effects, including luggage and paper and plastic garbage bags packed with clothing, teams from the Cleaning Department followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, images appearing on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the park's center.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people at the epicenter of the camp were candated among themselves by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disruption of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the top uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of detectives, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not conducting the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, should they have to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block to the south.
From those positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a series of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for dismissals
The union that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is, possibly, the last weapon available to the union, in municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on October 7, in a movement that trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a healthcare fund run by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a hearing at City Hall last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council counterattacked by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be dismissed.
City District officials 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all of whom are Black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city's legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more assistants as they had been chronically undersubsidized.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The District 36 budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that secondary school principals may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, even though "surplus" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school payroll to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired," says the draft complaint, "and not just in excess."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats on the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar the Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for the U.S. involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "valenty."
"This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya, as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties were fighting each other and the White House over the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain filed a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But the very day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually reap the grass under his feet.
The Congress's indecision was then overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee's resolution "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "encourages the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide the legislators as did the June bill?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's chief Republican.
Place's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is voting this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The bill, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other issue that in fact achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that will "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially novice Republicans seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can serve, while representative José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York), wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th Congress.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren't much more successful then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Fucked but not defeated, " Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at point-blank range in a constituent act in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat for Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang accompanied by the Broadway tune "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41, replied, "Pretty well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special "20/20" program, which aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special program analyzed Giffords' recovery since the January 8th shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
She can only hold one or two upright fingers, while her husband cheers her up.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head move.
A frown of the lips.
And then his first word: "What."
In a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast", a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: The congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading to Giffords an article in the newspaper about the March 12 murder when she arrested him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been beaten.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back harder than ever."
The troops make you feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines stormed their posts around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They showed them as some sort of orphan child," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they did.
But it wasn't respect, really.
Markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken over the military and a often distant, sometimes worshiping, American public.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, say the members of the service.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were sorry for those in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the audience they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the pity talks take place in silence and in private among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an "angry and violent Veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to endure under pressure from a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancen recalled telling his children.
Military unrest arises, in part, from U.S. indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praise of politicians and the public focuses to a large extent on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his barracks at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if she could join him in her room for a drink.
"An alarm signal sounded," says Lyman.
However, the Texas native left her concern aside.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a judicial decision at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread rape among the military, in violation of the soldiers' constitutional rights.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the army's top plane, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a top-down structure," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have come into contact with her, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, you will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Department team, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active staff.
"The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs' military service," the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to give them the discharge of service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing her of discriminatory practices in the way she handles claims of benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response.
However, the attacks are significantly underreported, and by Pentagon estimates themselves, which is about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the rates of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the army went to trial - half as much as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case, describe his attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a multitude of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and the blood of her assailant - from a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the living room."
"They put me in the psych unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't their judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was dispensed from service under less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case filed by Lyman and his co-defendants continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as responsibility.
And he adds, "Probabilities are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go its way, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will put his hundreds of other plaintiffs in line for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - just log on to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British study centre DEMOS.
Facebook's personal information cache is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific precision - the way sellers have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed advertisements to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes towards violence, and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way to do an investigation," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
DEMOS' work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "Likes", messages on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a boom in research, driving the number of academic works with the title name to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't get close to with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook eliminates all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that university students who spoke of their drunkenness exploits on Facebook had a significantly greater risk of drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student post too many state updates with their drunkenness.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Health, Behavior and Child Development Center at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "punching" its own population to get data.
The site's Data Team has compiled statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - advocates of digital freedom long ago arguing that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice to be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study he conducted with the public student Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that some of the information on a user's profile and the messages on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper clip and a pen are still the best research tools no one can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of the social still happens offline."
"Cold and inhumane: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo courthouse.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court, as it was mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a speech written in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards conclusion.
"I thought it seemed cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian radio station NRK.
"It was awkward, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at the journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be comforted that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a relative of a victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it were."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview Shown In A Theatre This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs, on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius from technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently rediscovered that has been dusted as a preview of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of products.
He was undoubtedly a designer, dreamer and self-recognised hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a junkie of flowcharts - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for over an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensely on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transportation.
It was only after Jobs died that a complete copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly reissued archive material is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute missing interview that arrives at Landmark cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technology philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when the perfectionism of Jobs comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing him to go faster towards the most important topics or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It is one thing to read posthumous evaluations of Job's career, but there is something crude and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers they invariably give you are, "Oh, that's just the way it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs brings your efforts to the detail to simplify Apple's accounting.
Disconcerted by the way in which the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made at the eye of a good cook, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the Pope's Joke:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long distance calls for free.
It has been written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and screaming through the pay phone and returning a minute later to the pay phone next door," says Jobs with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an amazing lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two burst out in laughter just before the Pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling on the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call to him.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste my time with that machine and write programs for her.
On improvising innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of base plates, a client asked him if he could assemble the entire team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while on Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost 300 dollars], and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's revival, Jobs prophetically foresaw how many industry leaders would stumble into their vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, so what?"
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is these kinds of people who end up running companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't make electrons do, glass makes them, robots make them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end everything is reduced to taste - it is reduced to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been embarrassed about stealing big ideas.
What made the Macintosh big in part was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who by chance were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't for computer science, he could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with the rivals of the healthcare law while the court accepts the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether they would accept President Obama's challenge to the healthcare law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were invited to a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit and, in fact, a 5-and-a-half-hour historical plea is expected for March, and the outcome will likely further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be at its peak at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and claim that the law must be discarded will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another signature that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
Dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the healthcare law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which reads: "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event. "
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with enormous financial interest, was sufficient to alarm the ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several magistrates that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
"The judges were honored in a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in fund-raising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say they mix the court's activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a leading conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying he was too involved in defending the law to be impartial now.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing receives a record $18 billion order
Emirates Airline orders 50 double aisle aircraft Boeing 777, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at over $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it's a big transaction when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. aircraft and the selling price for the 50 aircraft amounts to a record $18 billion.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that for the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order ever for commercial aircraft worth in dollars - 50 double corridor Boeing 777 jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to 26 billion dollars, announced Boeing at Dubai Air Show 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," Morningstar Neal Dihora analyst said.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so damaging, because the country is earning money with the increase in the price of oil.
That is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The UAE request solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide fuselage aircraft market and helps keep at bay its competitor Airbus SAS's attempt to invade its domain with the A350 passenger plane.
Boeing's victory at the air fair comes four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares went up 1.5 percent to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote in Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped his PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor's contest.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race for one of her opponents.
The preliminary results took the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... They seized the ballot boxes, set up barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely overtaken Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate for his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the post of governor, was in third place, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is President Calderón's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidates out of fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, for next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world's two fastest growing economies had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that look at Europe's difficulties in an "impartial" way and said that Asian financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU bailout fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power for Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from the fall in exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility for helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India's billion two hundred thousand people, up to 800 million of whom live on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not go well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in jobs in poorly managed companies, and generating losses such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing "downside risks" due to Europe's threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed up Congress on Monday, warning that upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a chain financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional reduction of $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said Congress' failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping," would lead to 23 percent global cuts and a halt to many new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible to execute - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials inadvertently and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to discharge civilians in order to meet the objective."
"These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously harm the good will."
Cuts over time would reach combat troops, Panetta said.
"While wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in the base budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of the war-supporting contract."
"Staff on payroll would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result with which we can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"Hijacking is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to occur."
Whether Panetta's letter and recent senators' warnings will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts is yet to be seen.
Panetta has been more and more frank about possible cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries."
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions "generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and engaged previously throughout the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter aircraft, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and further testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses of lying to the other.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "caught" with an open microphone affirming to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself with his denials quickly refuted by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with violations of campaign funding related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been instances in which teachers have given exam responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find ourselves?
On any given day, studies show that you can be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Surely, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a serious knowledge branch based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades at prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been refuted.
Liars do look into the eyes.
They don't always stutter, babble, blush, or get restless.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or expose.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and times.
I spent several years canvassing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, handling their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-oriented lies," while women say more lies "oriented toward others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie to their partners less often than people who are not married (but the lies they often say tend to be "enormous").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do I know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called "create a baseline."
It helps to provide benchmarks for later measurement of changes.
Observe the subject's posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
You'd better know if someone normally beats his foot all the time to avoid making unfair accusations when he sees his feet pounding in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive, verbal and nonverbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavior groups as alarm signals, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the top of the body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean towards an exit, change their posture significantly, or display a "post-interview shock" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Questioners often falsely show that the interview is over just to seek that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up and used the past time as he claimed his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... to what I know... to my understanding."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted after the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline planned from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- enraging unions, while appeasing environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's manager, Alex Pourbax, says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This follows last week's announcement by the State Department that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes to avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater, are explored.
"This is a real path to progress," Representative Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may set aside any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's request, and expressed his full support.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
I'd take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta Province to refineries in Texas.
To do so, it would be necessary for him to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have opted for the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a distance from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found that the project had only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said the department's inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to direct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to throw up in fear
A New York family claims that the disco music diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrorizing her little daughter to the point that she threw up in fear.
The diatribe of "Lady Marmalade" singer scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that he suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "he increased his fear of strangers," says his family in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 of last year when stager Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood by the door and put her daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Someone came up from behind and said, "You know what your daughter's doing?' I said "yes' and I went to get her," he said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman angry.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "He shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
He had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," the girl's mother said.
LaBelle fell over the mother -- still holding Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her surroundings and removed to a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get an answer.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return calls to comment on what had happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money he gets to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her behavior," Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it comes to a kindergarten teacher holding an 18-month-old child."
Climate Adversity Stopped the Economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's management, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, reduced foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, called the change, that generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historical fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost effects, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was sustained in 582,835 hectares cultivated, of which 78,03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main sinister crops being vegetables, maize and chickpea.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55,000 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53% of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate rose to 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that in number of people leaves more than 74,000 Sinaloans unemployed, an increase compared to the first semester of 18,969 individuals.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a resource restriction by legislation passed at Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who illegally grab dollars it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because entering they already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the employed population in the state works without being contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labor lags are low wages, the organization has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
FDI contraction
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the biggest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment of the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of the State FDI totaled 630,697 dollars, representing a drop of 87,74 percent compared to the 5 million 143,312 dollars recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17 billion pesos per year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the state government asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reviving the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, Mario López Valdés' first year of government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the terrain we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have failed to align the effort of everyone and above all the already synchronized good march of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events like the frosts of the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to prosecute the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resource be detonated," he said.
Work to be done
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better directs the government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been striving to achieve good results in various areas, there are some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He's convicted for 8 kgs of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic reported that the sentenced narco-menudist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by members of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite pole 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narco-menudist was circulating in a white pick-up truck, where he was carrying a black bag in the vehicle box and in the co-pilot's seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was placed at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person remains in detention at the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Must contributions for works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of municipal social development indicated that although so far the work programmes have progressed, they are at risk because the State Government has not fulfilled the contributions due to it, which amount to more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the completion of these works becomes effective.
"There are almost 12 million that they have to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part," he said, "we have started the works in order not to delay and they are very advanced, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not comply with the contributions due to them, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not provide at that time.
"It already happened to us in the previous six years because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to access these programs to cover what the State left pending," he explained.
Although there is a commitment by the State authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten efforts to ensure that their respective percentages reach as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth."
Valid "analogue blackout" cut in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional disputes between the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue blackout" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes necessary to invalidate it did not meet.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to complete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed because it did not reach a qualified majority of eight votes in order for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the reservation of law.
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without going into the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to be prepared.
"I don't think that if I did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the governing body of the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, resulting in better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "since it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic governance of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and he has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the sphere of competence of Congress, since compliance with the laws issued by the Legislature is being provided in the administrative sphere, he said.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP the difference between first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of this year's electoral process in Michoacan, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacan (IEM), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local norms with federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or Electoral Justice Act, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the current electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their publication within the time limits provided for in the Law on the Official State Newspaper, on the grounds that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislative branch and called the state president's vote on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal," since he has no right to "sanction or veto them."
Interviewed about the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total recounts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may occur in cases where: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of counting and counting in the file of the box or is not held by the president of the box; or, where there are errors or obvious alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all polling stations may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate presumed to have won the election in question and the candidate who has obtained the second place in the ballot is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the party representative and/or coalition who ran for the second of the candidates indicated.
The total count of the vote may also be made if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the candidate presumed to have won and the candidate located in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case electoral packages that have been partially counted will be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is just 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountain range of Zapalinamé, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, during Monday they held reconnaissance and a mass of requiem.
According to his relatives, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving a tribute on the side of the other people killed in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.

Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he was even dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, like the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: flying an aircraft.
They're giving him the last goodbye.

They locate three abandoned corpses on Cadereyta NL estate
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot and killed in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in an abandoned estate in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery happened at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place observed that in the fifth, whose bard is beige with coffee, was the gate wide open.
When they looked inside, about three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, so they immediately notified the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow shirt with dark denim trousers, without shoes; next to him was another with a white strap shirt.
A few feet away was the body of another individual with red shirts and blue denim pants.
All three were face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three people were allegedly killed elsewhere, as no casings were found on the site.
In the fence of the fifth one you can see legends that are directed from one group of organized crime towards another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same one and the gate.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Ministry of National Defence presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are associated with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" and clandestine burials.
According to the information released, in a first incident on 11 November in Los Alveros colony, eight people were arrested and one who remained deprived of his liberty was rescued.
They were assured of three properties and one cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".

They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the whole eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present the President with the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his remarks indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the battered confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were considerably boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocrat majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations, on Monday.
He'll end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels among the uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
To rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections are brought forward.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that he should be made up only of technicians, an indication of his objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of the Spaniards is superior to that of the ticos
Of the 22 so-called Spanish footballers, ten outnumber 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 summoned came to the 50 encounters.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, compared to the 22 called by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., in the National Stadium of San José.
While world and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly rank, account for an extensive record of class A interselection games, the Tricolor only possesses defender Michael Umaña as the only one with the 50 international matches.
That figure reached it the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity every year in league championships and domestic cup, and high-level clashes in European Cups such as Champions League.
Added to this is the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers of the Euro Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have a limited international touch in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish National Team is of the archer Iker Casillas, who the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, a brain flyer from Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA together with the other centennials of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ram, Raúl González, with 102.
Near the centennial figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Diaz, with 48 presences and gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five outnumbered the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't come close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba dos, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar owns only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
The historic scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 targets, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one with the highest scores with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in his two-decade-long celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday, at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them, too, the dream of playing in the country will become a reality.
This was assured by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its two decades of work celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
On that day they will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with the angeline band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is on The Nation on the Internet.
For their Costa Rican followers, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it's been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we're gonna be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I ask because there is some kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the previous days.
What do they tell their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in São Paulo and we hope that made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're very anxious to play there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this about?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting to people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined we'd be in a big rock band and doing it for more than 20 years makes it sound like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It's always been an honor to be part of that big band.
We are very close to the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a city band emerges, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them still and we're honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange that a band like yours should stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we are all fortunate to be still alive and, second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance sheet?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too much touring because it is easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without being infatuated by being famous and being a rock star, something none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were many frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very close friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture I think of the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing he can think of.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There's so many of them.
Among the first ones I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about bassists that I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about her, she reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's a wonderful thing because it's music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and has now become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they're deep dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, they certainly represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is admitted again for medical examinations
Former president Alberto Fujimori was admitted Tuesday to a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a cancer in the language for which he has been operated four times and which is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, said he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He was operated four times from cancer to the tongue, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos, which has been joined by other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, the cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been detained since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican pair, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community resident in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proprietary for the exchange of information on all political issues between the two nations," according to the South American presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the French incident that arose when French president Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultation of its ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group composed of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has in force with the South American country, since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
In the commercial sphere, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigoted plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, untiringly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he has never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally intended for that support" , as so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to give a "second round" to the levels of the game, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winks the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, consisting in that the plumber of the mustache will have to travel platforms mined of dangers in order to release Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom supports Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he processed the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the country of the North that Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, bearing in mind that a sentencing court had already ordered extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he "did not put his hands" in court decisions and processed all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done is an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted in order to prosecute the ex-mandatario from 2000 to 2004.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of untrained children
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
In addition to this, there are a hundred long jobs currently available for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held in the old Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, no work, with problems of dogradiction or in a position to fall into marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former socialist education consultant Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and current ecosocialist councilman Ricard Gomà attended the event.
The current conseller of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the grand hall of La Fabra i Coats.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The president gave Trinijove as an example of how to fight bad circumstances and give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Evicted an squatter farm where they made macro-fests
The invaders had taken possession of 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm yesterday noon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday's noon voluntarily the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macro-fests that despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on there will be an access control," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took away the entire electrical installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the mass parties, which lasted for up to two days and made the tenants desperate.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has gone down 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the invaders of the estate made him unfair competition, since they sold the drinks at three euros, while in the discotheque they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had had to respond to neighborhood complaints of noise, while, according to him, the inconveniences were not caused by the clients of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the squat house and, above all, by those attending the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the inconveniences were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago she "forgave" her rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal PP group in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had last week called for "immediately unlodging the building to end the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the occupied building, but over the last few months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some there have even been robberies.
In this sense he added that, "it is necessary to end the impunity and be forceful against the incivism that has been generated in the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police proceeded to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed that four persons were accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond polemics on fees
The municipal contest on the 16 gates reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed some pasquines of promotion of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again placed, in the imaginary of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but above (mountain) -below (sea).
Collserola's rating as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these were until, in September, the city council convened a megacompetition composed of 16 contests for so many other access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone pretends to put doors in the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it supposes of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring subject to be touched upon when two members of this former caste of elect are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coast front "it is necessary" to debate about "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is possible to start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "Collaserola gates" contains a "lexical trap": they should not be thought of "as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of areas where action is needed".
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from how "uncertain it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80's and had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where one can build.
"To limit something is to fix the next step," that is, its overstep.
"It is necessary to think of new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (GMP)] can give rise to real disasters."
More close to the question, Mòdol believes that, simplifying, the valley slope of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", by a purely topographical question.
Mòdol remembers that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall into a broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the council offers to his guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows the architects to enter into the debate, but "doubts" about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right", he points out) that they have had to create: "Architects should be just a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest lacks a global vision of Collserola: "16 transversal contests have been convened -he says- in the sense mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least where appropriate, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the architect next door.
In his view, however, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in its entirety, for an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonah Larrazábal and will go free
After 72 days of taking root, the legal representative of Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the process that followed him for alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonah Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted him the pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which continues a process of blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonah allegedly demanded payment of an economic fee so that the regional council would allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
Following the public complaint, the State Attorney's Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the PAN mayor and on 2 September he was arrested and held for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Office Agent 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for 49 days following the issuance of a second arrest warrant after the Public Prosecutor's Office officer dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with 1.5 million pesos; however, he remained only for a few hours in the medium-security prison because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was ordered to be arrested by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that nearly two months after investigations sufficient evidence was checked to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing it to be operated.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the royal mayor; so in the next few hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the public prosecutor attached to the court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the members of the gambling house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the 197/2011 file, the legal pardon is granted to Jonah Larrazábal and henceforth no complaint may be filed concerning the proceedings that followed him; in addition to that he will not be required to make reparation for harm or punishment.
After the hearing with the legal representative of the gambling house, at about 15:50 Larrazabal Breton was ordered immediately to be released.
The court clerk, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be filed.
He will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven other people
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the terrain, the blades had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so he had the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that research done in the impact area did not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees inclination.
At the moment, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results before possible; however, the research can last several months, it could even reach a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff operated in cruise speed and that this happened in an ascending soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, SCT headline Pérez Jácome listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out under the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports at the AICM placed appropriate conditions for take-off, as the aircraft progressed towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, layers of cloudiness were present at low altitude.
Selected paths:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew has sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the latest radar aircraft record match, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and side path.
The pattern of the aircraft's debris dispersal suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the disaster, no evidence remains to be revealed in the ship's remains of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above the average sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was presumably broken down along this route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a larger area than the cordoned site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which reinforces the presumption that the impact was presented under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security leads research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the 'Genetic protocol of obesity in childhood and adolescence', which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research, the population is invited to participate, whether or not they are entitled, to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out for minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He highlighted that the protocol began in the Quauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of West Mexico) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico Oriente).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
When World Diabetes Day was celebrated on 14 November, he said that the goal was to bring together 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and inherited family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure intake, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic levels are applied to all participants (genes associated with childhood obesity are sought).
Cruz López pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight there was also a dramatic rise,' noted the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others because of its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the integral evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the television and using means of transportation instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high calorie intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (sizes, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt of UNAM would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a better-performing mixture, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate, the potholes could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated altogether.
In his lecture A technological opinion of potholes, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory in charge develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called Maltese, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the pebbles that constitutes the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If they were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, it abounded, a final layer called a rolling folder is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also requires to have the proper thickness and the material from which it is made should be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil moistens, the water spreads inside the folder and it is difficult to come out, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, the first to wear out is the bearing film and only after the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to the first signals with proper maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is met, in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already in the market and allow to repair the potholes with ease and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate lack to be the new Ms. Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected melina Ramirez Serna not reaching the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of princess.
Once again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire of Miss Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and band that credited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and the scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallecaucan women who have been near the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question many ask themselves is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess is that it did not convince her with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why?" made by Martín Murillo Gómez, from Carreta Literaria Leamos.
To the interrogator the valleycaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I believe quite a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think the book that marked me as a child is "The Little Prince," it's a pretty deep book.
Currently I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
An answer that did not like first for the term "culturalizing" and second for not explaining in concrete way how each of the books he cited has marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony he manifested himself to be calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise happens what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses launched, Valle was said to have been burned by favoritism.
A Bogotan journalist suggested that being the favorite, the ovated and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best artisan costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and so did not shine on the stage".
And that was noticed in his first swimsuit presentation on the Hilton beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although both looked safe, it was noted that it lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for the "Como en casa" program at Canal RCN, said that Melina's designation as princess "checks that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen."
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For some reason, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her defects in the melt and fibrosis in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, dropped points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine considers that the error of the Vallecaucana was the surgical interventions that were performed.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her fort and here she was charged."
For this award, which for the first time presents the National Competition of Beauty, after the parade in swimsuits arose a cruel vaticinio that was fulfilled last night, since it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo granted to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Contest itself.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was dodged the crown.
This was the work of the caleño who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lofoscopist from Cali passed into history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a CTI lophoscopist from Cali passed into history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Farc's top chief: "Alfonso Cano", through the collation of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists working in the STI section, that week it was the turn of "availability" for Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to stay in the jungle for more than five days to reach the place where the bodies that had to be identified were located.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after completing the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopia, which is the study of friction skin, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry the decadactillar card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the chief of the Farc.
In search of the print
For a dactyloscopist from the Sijín de Cali, the recognition given by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, that can become key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lofoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present false cards or have no papers.
We took their fingerprints and looked them up in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Footprints can also rule out or reassert suspects in homicide cases.
Recently they found a dead man, with liquor bottles all around him.
The investigation found that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a print on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the crime scene.
A Dactyloscopist from the STI explained that in objects "prints are taken out with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the STI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI TV show.
Just as not all that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes trace.
However, if it can be used, if the respective matching is done.
"Indignados" Challenge Authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part of them responded to the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square from where they were evicted early in the morning and trying to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the "indignados" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been further arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court doesn't allow us to go back to camp in the square, we're going to settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the "indignados"' response to the eviction from their camp personally issued by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignados" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, linking New York and New Jersey, and owned by Trinity Church parish.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray was unable to confirm the specific figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization claims that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved to show support for the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square, which is a privately owned compound, is still closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday in which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters were carrying and distributing copies of this court order at this time and even handing them over to the agents guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who reported that some officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or forbid protesters from re-entering the park with stores or other properties they used previously."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, who he alerted, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with tents and sleeping bags.
The governor personally defended the eviction carried out early in the morning from Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people," as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that at the bottom Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesperson for the movement, who accused the mayor of "lack of respect for freedom of expression."
The leaders of "Ocupa Wall Street" also indicated that they plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months of the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas TV special
Along with Michael Bublé and other leading Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a lifeguard on "Baywatch", a little bunny of "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas special on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" Michael Bublé and other leading Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1th giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a pornographic home video in which she appears together with her then husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "bitch" during one of her concerts in New York City.
Japan Reborns After the Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescing by the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the Japanese country suffered since World War II.
The Tokyo Government ' s first estimates had estimated material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seemed to have diminished.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to move on, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - supposes, moreover, the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the upturn in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas ravaged by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared with a decrease of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsiveness of the Japanese economy is not solely based on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructures, using the gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "housing values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the cloudy forecasts of the US, a privilege that weighs like a slab on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the yen quote.
While the markets continue their siege of the EU's peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government does not lower its guard.
"We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa, yesterday.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member countries presented sharper signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the world economy showed that the major powers are slowing down.
Since it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro area was even below the average, which is at level 100, as eight-tenths to 99.13 points were precipitated.
Athens Feeds Doubts Again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty reinstated in the parks, Greece is still entangled in the maze leading to the exit from the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
As long as the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the one-hundred-day period agreed upon in his appointment may fall short of their implementation, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," said Papadimos, opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not dispel doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the $8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still scorched by the impact of the sordid Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "an unambiguous written compromise as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of $8 billion, although there is no final date.
The Greek hag still has thread for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place worldwide in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofía recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" she pointed out that it is a "tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people who live with incomes less than a daily dollar, with which the "poverty threshold" is fixed".
Spain "continues working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and takes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is proposed not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families had access to these financial services and 100 million of those households were expected to rise above the poverty line in which they were living.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty," whose work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to observe the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link to this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero de los pobres".
Finally, Reina Doña Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this sense, he explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that micro-credits are "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty," and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it fall victim to the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to people "excluded from those who close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially, the future of Europe had not been placed on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who consider that the government policy is currently too weak with the Greeks and could be too strict in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were registered.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe."
This could be manifested in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to enable the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Without a doubt, it is unlikely that the 27 will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen Germany's weight.
Anxious for calming the moods within her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither has she tried to win her congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not moved France.
Except in passing.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the grants, the UMP and the Government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and give a speech on the issue, which has been recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which part of the desire to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of lack on private sector workers before they can take the fall.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly earnings.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose a non-remunerated day of absence on staff members in the event of leave from work (so far, they are not lacking, compared with the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, most of them also bring to the table the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuse of job losses.
"The controls will be increased considerably and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing fraud, he will have to repay the amounts," said Xavier Bertrand speaking at RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in terms of job losses.
In fact, there has been constant monitoring of this issue since 2002 and a number of political offensives have been launched that have normally borne fruit.
The French are sick only in the rest of Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), more than Euro237 million was paid in 2006 in the form of unemployment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for casualties accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46 per cent is for maternity leave and occupational accidents, while 54 per cent is related to sick leave, amounting to Euro6.2 billion.
Consequently, 2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French had taken an average of 14.5 days off from work, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37 per cent of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between one and three months and 11 per cent were longer.
Compared to our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS showed that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence from work rate (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% to 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13 per cent of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term casualties were “unjustified or too long”, or 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, which were systematically inspected, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "adequately adapted or unjustified; a total of $1.2 million was estimated at 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
No doubt, a negligible figure compared, for example, to work in black.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, such a practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between €9,000 and €15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of allowances for casualties and certainly considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten out its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos stated before Parliament on Monday, 14 November; he also added that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to achieve that goal.
"In order to make efforts leading to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence to Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, since the country's permanence in the euro area is at stake, he added.
As a result, Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, showed Monday his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said during a meeting with the deputies of his "New Democracy" party.
He noted that he agreed with the objectives of deficit and debt reduction, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has replied that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized
Canadians live denying death, according to the Royal Canadian Society report
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they wish to die and make arrangements to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code so that assisted suicide and euthanasia are permitted, when the patient is considering this option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death."
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Canadian Society.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded by Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report had reached conclusions that did not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which had already stated that it did not wish to amend the Penal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians Favoring Euthanasia
Let us remember that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
Regarding persons who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that no prosecution should be initiated against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of patient care, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among its recommendations, it suggests that it should be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The committee of experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses end-of-life care without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in health institutions in Canada, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and subjected to the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Canadian Society experts' report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of experts who sign the report as "extreme", not least because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill people.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she described as "manifest in favor of euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Canadian Society, questions especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan’s King Urges President El Assad to Abandon Power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bachar El Asad demonstrated yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure intensified on the Syria of Bachar El Assad who, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced the sanctions against Damascus, while Syria's neighbours Turkey and Jordan have spoken out in favour of President Asad's abandonment of power.
King Abdalá II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader to ask President Bachar El Assad to "abandon power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime's forces has already passed away.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, Syria's neighboring country, in an interview for the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the Dar'a region of southern Syria have already lost their lives, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have been killed "during bombings and heavy machine gun shootings in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem believes that the country is "advancing towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damasco from his duties, which in its view constitutes a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not waver," he added, ensuring that "the plots plotted against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civilian protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, has also expressed support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his opinion, is contained in "paranoia".
A further extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Serguei Lavrov, yesterday judged the Arab League's decision to be "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan from the crisis, although it did not express its support for the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks time for markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today met with the trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats external to Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of Parliament from one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the designated Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he hopes that Mario Monti will ask Parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, undoubtedly of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In the "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its program, he said, adding that it is "sure that the markets will be patient and understand it".
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but concern was then imposed, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next legislative ones, he considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has made a commitment that, when he takes office, he will work in view of the urgency and the objective of Italy 'recovering its role' in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for further stringent measures.
The Italian "chief of the bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot respect the requirements in terms of deficit".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to editorialists.
The big question will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some 200 billion euros in state obligations by April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
Last week the IAEA expressed its "serious concern" over a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades since the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and had been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamancers" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Subsequently, it is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as one Member State has informed the Agency, worked for most of his career in nuclear detonation technology in his home country's military nuclear program."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly over the same period, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14 per cent overall increase in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that such crimes and crimes have increased again," said Human Rights First, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has been pointing out for a long time that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds Paul Legendre, head of the organization.
"The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses," he adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of the civil rights struggle.
Such legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin colour, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging Twitter site modified on Monday the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another one called "name" allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twittos", that is, of those netizens whose messages ("tweets") follow you on the Internet or follow you.
This allows you to know if they track messages, if they are credited to new accounts, if they qualify a favorite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ovre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a cellui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the net, users have discussed with different opinions the interest of this innovation at the same time as tweets.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
On Tuesday, the government of the great Social-Democratic/Christian coalition in power in Austria decided to include in the Constitution a "golden rule" of the budget to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional €3 billion in interest each year," said the Vice-Chancellor of Christian Democrat Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, by the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in an Act with equivalent value.
The measure adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the federal state structural government deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention of the exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we prove that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historic peaks that led to the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been gradually going back since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "shelter value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was requoted on Tuesday to less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was listed at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, since it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the revenues obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Noda said, fearing that the rise of the yen will cut the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has regained growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic base."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the right measures", implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased by five trillion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasury Letters, bringing to the 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of the funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The guys grow up, the bags falter.
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the most weakened countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges sink a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 loses 1.4 per cent and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"Taking into account the new tensions regarding the returns on loans from the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to yield part of their recent profits."
"Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market players regarding Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye on Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a limited range of variations, so investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Towards 10 hours, the European currency was worth $1,3570, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, for the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates more than 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian bonds at 10 years reached 6.85 per cent, while Spanish bonds at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions with regard to interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interventionists.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, said that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in spread rates between 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historic peak.
Pending growth figures in the euro area
From the statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the 0.3 per cent expected, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a 0.1 per cent reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is one issue that cannot be dealt with in the light of short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is appropriate for an electoral meeting to be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The discussion would be useful only if it considered the full economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic developments will duplicate electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the increasing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, not forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case with Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor with Switzerland, which only aims to build new generation power stations.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite a few examples, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in a rise in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
Consideration should be given to the case of Denmark.
Europe's champion in the wind sector, of which 30% of its electricity is obtained, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittance of the wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would reduce realism to the wonderful declarations about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not object in principle to this type of energy, as the polls show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets that can create non-removable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear power, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
In order to solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
The development by Areva of solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a safety authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three major accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not have consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, just as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is being studied by all the electrical actors who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free way to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "human rights country".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the May 23 Libération newspaper) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this subject, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take charge of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande merely includes banalities, indicating that co-development will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly low-skilled workers, by pushing for a reduction in their wages.
But experience shows that immigrants are in fact more complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly engage in professions in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country lacking anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive impact on the salaries and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1% in migration flows represents an increase in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized US Nobel Prize winners and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, accounting on average for 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income less expenditure) of Euro150,000 to public budgets on average throughout his or her life.
At the beginning of his term of office, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go and look for the growth points he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but also fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than 2,000 years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some perhaps believed that, for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and as directly as possible.
We know, from Napoleon the Little One, that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough alone and can even become an "instrument of oppression," as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a twofold revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be considered in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a halt to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take blows, but a common, full, peaceful and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is folding to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffer their impotence and their lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated in the international arena.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for people's sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because it is only together that Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead to a new stalemate.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The interest-motivated revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It will only be possible to build a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europe.
Non-contact chip cards are generalized
The global chip card lounge starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart cabinet calculations.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for common transport or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, $320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (a projected 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa banking cards already have this function, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the large areas work for four.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million non-contact Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To get the upper gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically disseminate in the future, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the contactless system", announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for conducting transactions.
"They're lingering."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Crédit agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
iPhones from around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a cover that allows non-contact payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the long suspected Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algiers already "has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the runways.
Raptured in a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues particularly captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" had become increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and discourses or in his operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened unworthy of interest.
Fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the partnership is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the sharia, while its militants throw themselves into the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily oriented towards churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as it usually happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became its first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, ranging from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is a source of concern to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and stated that he was willing to "share all the information".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A America weakened by crisis, can it manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates are making more and more loud statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of Republicans.
The often groundless slogans about China, Iran, aid to Israel are extended.
Mitt Romney, the best placed candidate in the race for the "Grand Old Party" nomination, has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulation of their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama's Ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that "absorbs" emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Reagan-style.
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if the sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
"If I get elected, I will stop Iran," he boasted.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-ranked candidate, shows shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "attempts to develop nuclear capability," apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The current President's opponents answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naïve dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq and on their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it as weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population judges Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden, in a rather positive way.
From Iraq, he is wary of military interventions that lead to a collapse.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama seems to be fairer.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia via the Baltic Sea bottom, has already been put into operation.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the steering wheel of the valve controlling the Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first has 1,224 km connecting the St Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, that is, sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge play presents the airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land flow by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
All of a sudden, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to shut off access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of energy Europe, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to win its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and increasingly limited reserves.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically unites us," François Fillon confirmed during the opening of the gas pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom's directors, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against the anchors of ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
In order to build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream society.
It was also necessary to strengthen measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in all its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in the waters of Sweden, but those responsible for the project renounced it, seeing that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to establish itself permanently at sea off its coast.
"In case of a breakdown, we'll stop the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller says.
In the event of leakage, gas from the gas pipeline shall therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, as they have foreseen joints that, according to the forecasts, they will have a leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the gas pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, which carries out external inspections, as well as by means of a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is inserted inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any repair.
The flow of gas is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the company, for a period of 25 years renewable, the entire gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," Jens Müller says.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been carried out by 30 per cent with the contribution of shareholders and 70 per cent through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of spending.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy pine-planted coast.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a bookmark.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch to the market a notebook of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, at that time a consultant of the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used, among other things, to cover the benches.
This kind of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Away has remained the confidential production of the early years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts business people as well as students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its beginnings, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with Moleskine's development: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard tapas, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer covers... The brand encompasses a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of disabled people are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled persons doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared with 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disheartening?
"No," says Eric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past 15 years has been considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, much remains to be done."
It should be mentioned that the disabled unemployed continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 (on average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 per cent have not completed their baccalaureate and only 10,000 of the 2.3 million students in higher education are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to work and that "constitute the crux of the problem", says Christian Grapin, General Manager of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of people advances, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the Cité pointed out that the directors surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual deficiencies".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the target of hiring 6% disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law of...1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date back to 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6 per cent.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, has decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created a great deal of pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with 20 to 49 employees have disabled employees in their workforce, compared with 82 per cent of enterprises with 100 to 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We will not dare to say that there was collusion among them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side, on the stand of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker's spiteful gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's striker answers.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it's a set", has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to place myself."
Convened to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brighten".
Not forgetting the "pleasure."
He has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
Without a doubt, this will particularly reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathyeu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", remember.
"We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to "proudness."
"Pride" for contesting "a gala match."
"Pride" also to prove, as "neighbour", that France "returns to being a very high level team", about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not be attending the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he said.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, hungry.
"You can watch it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento faces with great optimism the party back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the one-way party, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it; the Selecçao, which has been running since September 2010, is going to qualify for the 2012 Euro Cup.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Considering the one-way match (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given it tranquility.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't marked out of the house."
But at home, at the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be just as excited, even if it is evident that the party "is very even", dixit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope that the game will be very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to participate in the Euro 2012", has, however, relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's tie in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a tie, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't marked out of the house," Bento laments.
"We are going to play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not let them think."
A good idea, provided that, this time, it is realistic.
