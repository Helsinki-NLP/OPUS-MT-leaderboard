The ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the bakery.
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will apparently have to overcome the obvious language barriers so that the members of the Prague Board and the City Council understand their renewed SDG colleagues.
The Aktualně.cz period "examined" the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's political flower and cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the best-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a novice in Prague politics," said Culture Councilman Lukáš Kaucký during the "colleague" terminology examination.
And as far as the veteran politician is concerned, Karel Březina reacted the same.
Maybe they know the concept of today's golf.
"Possibly it's the only expression of all of you who asked me what I use from time to time."
"If not, I usually don't use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published in the Aktualně.cz newspaper last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial board chose six examples, in particular those that are particularly related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "the bull's neck", "treason from the capital" and "blindar".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a quarter, Antonín Weinert, who in future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolinek, refused directly to do so.
"I don't get involved in these things and I don't want to appreciate how civic Democrats have fun."
"What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, Councilman Lukáš Kaucký allegedly would not have realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does not say anything; the only term that was right in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucký says, adding immediately, "But I know it from the news."
"I'm going to have to sign up for a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Environment Councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Afterward, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý really is and even knows where to find that character; he also suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon it is revealed to Plachý that it is the headquarters of the companies of Janoušek.
Like Březina, he indicates that such knowledge gained them from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the test participants, among the socio-democrats there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but we really don't seem to have anything like it."
"Rather, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or we play word games with names," says the president of the ČSSD Prague, Petr Hulinský, whose party partners call Hulda.
"At school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my classmates also call me that," confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The Aktualně.cz newspaper tested the name and it works.
For his party partners, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the election deceptions during the party sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") from some of his companions.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulinský does not like to be called Hulda, but the Aktualně.cz newspaper discovered even other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of baton rights" apparently recalls that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava police academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of “witches”, as it published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They tend to be older, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
Women who "turn" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer such but."
"Neither is healthy young women isolated, because they help in the labors and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of West African State Burkina Faso, occupies a special residence of more than 100 women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an informative brochure that should help prevent witch-hunting.
However, this has a catch.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read," notes Die Standard on the disadvantages of writing awareness.
Allegations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, Burkina Faso's neighboring country, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman got caught in the oil used for ritual anointing.
It caught on fire when the group wanted to "expel the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people at all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The devourers of human souls always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease witch-hunting, in the Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a large hunt for witches who allegedly had been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To help him he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, were forcibly taken from Gambian villages randomly chosen men and women to the president's property in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the people arrested had to drink a pot of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive their stay on the estate.
After international pressure, about a thousand people were finally released from detention.
Bakala's Tenant: Heats up with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, old and tough, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnate" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he was carrying some documents with the new three-story leases: his own, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving sentence.
All three have just been caught in rent liberalization.
Instead of 3,500 Czech kroner per month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 kroner for a two-room apartment with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, there is no hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, over whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when they will publish a guide informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But in the face of this, man only makes a gesture.
"Everyone says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great test laboratory for liberalisation.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the apartments that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
That is why Aktualně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them is a number machine.
"Rent 2011", can be read on a bright button of your touch screen.
When you press it, a small piece of paper comes out of the machine with a number.
Almost doesn't give time to read "157" and already the number appears on the big screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rents.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as in the past: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
Letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase of the rent of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens at the customer service centre for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting," the workers who find themselves in it when the client presents themselves as a journalist respond briefly.
Liberalization and former mining floors in Bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were treated loudly and clearly by the Vice-President of Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change my damn bath plate," the man mentioned in the introduction vents.
According to the workers, for the time being they come mostly retired to check if they receive a discount on rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
Half of the February rent discount will also be paid to the remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," estimates the window employee.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rent, the matter must be settled by an independent judge.
"It's not a threat, it's information about the only way to proceed possible and completely in accordance with the law," warns RPG on its pages.
"No one is going to be judged here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court," he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr.Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so people may wait," he says.
Rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the landlords, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest in apartments for four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014, the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square metre per month," is indicated on the screen.
Only increase by 38% the rental of 400 floors of RPG's portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19,66 kroner per square metre," says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not suddenly affect rents, but will scale from four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent rise (see chart) back on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to people who sign the rent-up agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need day care.
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides a small nursery with all the same to such facilities: colored walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design's employees can come to her.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose study many well-known buildings of Brno emerged, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guard.
About 90 people work in the company, mainly in the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow the architects and delineators to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, day care is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers to its workers within the framework of its social program.
The builders and architects thus have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of the children.
The mini-guard was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of the management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-guard is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (an amount of more than CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to recruit qualified staff and services.
When funding runs out (two years), the company Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the mini-guards running with its own funds for three years.
Project preparation lasted one year and Economy Rating contributed to the submission of the funding request.
The care of children is provided by qualified personnel; moreover, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present for their care throughout the day; the day-care centre currently accommodates children without age limits, although most of them are under the age of three.
Since it is a "mini-garden" it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the day-care centre is flexible in order to adapt to the needs of the parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the day-care centre, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is an individual education and care, the contents of the mini-care programme are comparable to the regular pre-school curriculum.
Not only do children play, but they also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school readiness, they teach to English.
The class has not only toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up children from school late when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the companies that sign that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of personnel.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Look at Gaudí’s interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its skeleton-like shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of the scales and the omnipresent lines gently curved, all of which is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The front page of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, we observe a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire façade of the house seems even more impressive, as it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors improves.
Serpentea and the torsion of the forms continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the railings, the ornaments of the doors, the peepholes and the signs.
The Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, arose from the remodeling of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of carrying out a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his plans of the project emerged ornaments for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and mosaics used in the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Milá and Gaudí's park Güell, where other pieces of it are found.
Due to its organic shape, the premises shortly after its completion were nicknamed "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawns".
It is also said that, on top of the construction, the sword of Saint George, patron saint of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motifs.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the central heating season with vents and typical fireplaces.
His forty - five - degree inclination may be strange.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect the construction rules of the moment at all and did not let himself be influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so impacted with the result that it asked to be corrected.
He was disturbed, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only obtained a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with both colors brings maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist card holders get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entrance of other Gaudí buildings into the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and spring: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the spring.
Above all, they must be perfectly complemented so that they can be adapted to specific users.
During the election numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior on which the mattress and the spring are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they are "heated" more slowly.
In addition, they often weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them over more frequently.
If the canals of the center are not properly aerated and above, they are on a firm basis, they keep the moisture inside. Even mold can appear below.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep just as well here."
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have long nervous system problems, so they get bad information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in quilted furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico brand."
You no longer have to be a NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard match.
He just sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to your height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple standard to calculate the width: when lying face up, you should have your hands comfortably shrugged towards your elbows", advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čalouník
In double rooms, each one needs its own spring and mattress, so during purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the springs at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interiors a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeter are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you sit on the mattress, the docks should certainly not be noticed," says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of spring.
The fully quilted bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash their cover, which is often done today.
And, since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of cleaning and washing the cover, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers are currently made with zipper closure throughout their perimeter, so when opening them they stay in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress may seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a spring, do you have a firm board?
Never!
As much for beds designed for overnight visits.
However, it should make (if you don't already have them) ventilation holes in the board and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulating sheet springs containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although it is always best to use a spring with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the lumbar area sheets are reinforced and their stiffness can be regulated.
Articulated sheet springs should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixing of the sheets that allows pressing or even tilting the sheets in such a way that they "round" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "males", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are spring boxes with cross structure or splints with the so-called multitorsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is reduced.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the appropriate mattress and spring, if you use a bad pillow (large and "blow"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of them can relax.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying down on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the spring with shoulder reinforcement or softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses seem to have something to do with the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, from which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, e.g. castor or soy.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soy.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the centre is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with vegetable breeze extracts, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the sheath.
The red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warmth.
The favorites these days?
Cold foam mattresses, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, make them more permeable than normal polyurethane mattresses and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foam and viscoelastic make mattresses from different areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels are going.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have lower VAT, as they are considered as health facilities.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and springs.
Sometimes offers from manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the cover for 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The era of viscoelastics with an open cell structure and a high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during the take-offs astronauts were subject to enormous overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents use tracking devices to control their children
Fear for children is driving more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed to track vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in the case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Anička and began to learn about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We are all trying to tell us that it is not a matter of spying, but of another means of reducing the chances of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone's purse without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns of the fact that if the child does not want to wear it, he will simply throw it away.
"Even younger children show great creativity in intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"Before, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," says Bočková.
In his opinion, it is questionable whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
“If it is a prepared kidnapping, the perpetrator will practically always check whether the child has any electronic devices that can reveal his or her location.”
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices expands, you will also look for them, since their sale will certainly be carried out with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, their presence can help.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If you suffer damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices have a tilt gauge integrated, so if the person simply slips and stays still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In his view, such a service could be obtained even with smart phones with navigation, on which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that for the time being these are devices with a size similar to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
They can therefore be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why testing is currently taking place with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or I.D. him after a while, which can make the police buy time," he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the verification of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough fuses to surround the whole of the Czech Republic, but it only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of fuse to burn explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of fuse to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of the fuse is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosive fuse from the STV Group, a. s. for 40 million kroner.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of fuse by saying that the soldiers needed for the training maneuvers 60 kilometers of fuse a year.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnics of the army, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that in such a case, they should carry out such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
Neither Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr nor Army Captain Vlastimil Picek wanted to be exempt.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend 60 kilometres of wick.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of fuse, the army would have with the new purchase (including adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally to Minister Vondra recently because they say they have little ammunition for various weapons, so they even limit firing practices for money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also fail to understand that we are repeatedly bought such quantities of wick."
"But it's their decision, and they'll certainly know why they're acting like that."
"For us, the army is a good customer that, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of wick also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group indicates that the fuse has a service life of only four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its service life, each munition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of wick, he got a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's 244-kilometer order," says spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence's shopping center.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of wick by the pyrotechnics of the police, which eliminate the ammunition of the Second World War or that left by the Soviet army, no longer exceeds 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only for the right amount to exhaust the ammunition before the end of its useful life.
This was decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable wick types can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years there will be the following problem with the current one: we will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old fuse, which is now being bought "barata".
So far I still live on the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Employer of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
The last edition won the competition "Employer of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story looks like it's taken out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he brought together with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank credit he bought a house that was half ruined composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
"At present, the quality-price ratio of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting the first reconstructed floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested back in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year it opened another one of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said businessman number one last year.
"This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels was greatly helped by winning the 'Employer of the Year' contest," adds grateful Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends that everyone want to try some company to participate in the competition.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he still lives on contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have gotten.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
In total about seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It is not, far from it, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"It is only my name that appears on the front page," says today modestly Lukš Pytloun.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we've had at Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel Ã¡rský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone "Company of the Year" competition, last year at the "Slav House" in Prague.
The jury valued their efforts, with which they managed to convert a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition," says last year's winner.
The history of Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel's father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialised public after achieving success in the contest in the media.
"Not only did our customers begin to regard the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel
Last year maybe it wasn't just a sample of the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
It also obtained recognition for the trade results up to 2008 and, partially, in 2009.
And precisely the year 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We obviously don't get rid of this situation either."
"Incomes fell by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs," explains Karel ́árský.
A viable enterprise must sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company’s profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut spending was on research and development.
"With the grants, we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained excellent valuations at national fairs," says Árský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel ́árský.
A Survey that Reveals Ridiculous Rules
The Absurdity survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that staff members can access online.
The decision was made by more than one third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the business register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the business register when it carries out a check on the insured's impositions," said ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the Absurdity survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations to be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year he is a fourth time part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodřské noviny and begins to create hobbies among the general public as well.
While last year's edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, this year it almost reached 4,000.
And it is not surprising, since we still have a number of extra legal obligations that must be respected simply in order to trade.
"Perhaps in the number of papers needed for tax returns we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments for years.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for holding a company, the Czech Republic ranks 74th, eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated in the same way each year.
Anyone can indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Win the absurdity that receives the most votes.
For this year's survey, more than one hundred were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of seventy proposals this year is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic, attended this event.
"Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state continually hinders entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in drunken water.
In 2007, what was most disturbing to people was the employer's obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in the number of votes in 2007, that is, the communication to the labour office by its foreign workers of working trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third one goes the charm.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their office a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the competition of Hospodářské noviny is the category called Company responsible for the year 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone Empresa's main competition of the year 2010, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between them, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it concerns, for example, persons with disabilities, other personal or health problems of employees.
Among the 14 finalists from all over the Republic were, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of the company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has already been the main contributor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the workforce; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the contest Vodafone Empresa of the year ended third in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities will have the least impact on the environment," explains businesswoman Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible company of TI Enlogit of the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports the work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Person in distress grant, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the company's representative Ondřej Suchý.
The Praní a čištění laundry company in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that have an impact on their pension funds, is also well placed.
"We provide benefits in food, transportation, skills and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, from Bruntál Czasch's construction company, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year contest who answered the questions of the registration form were automatically appointed and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
The organizers removed forms that were not complete or wrong from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the contestant companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the contest of Company responsible for the year, but they are not disqualified from the contest "main" Vodafone Company of the year."
"Individual candidates for this competition are not allowed, as this is a subcategory of the main company competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police made arrests during a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police made several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land was received by a precise interested party.
He had to pay Luboš G. half a million kroner for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribes during a public auction and public bidding," Pilsen's chief attorney-general Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that she is currently unable to disclose further details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
How it could influence the public auction, given the lack of official information, can only be speculated.
The spokesman for the Lubomira Černá Agricultural Fund responded to Právo's questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and went during a public auction.
"This is a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called “Call for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the land law” and takes place when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a higher value than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and, later, the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the greatest offer," explained the Fund spokesman.
Luboš G. had information about who was going to submit to the call and, since he was also interested because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to the interested parties in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for some time now.
He was in the case of the former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was charged for dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly where a large road to the Borská pole industrial area should be built.
Later, he changed them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the town council had to intervene because, if not, the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay additional costs of several hundred kroner per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to take several hundred kroner a month out of the portfolio from January onwards than they do now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 kroner a year more than now.
However, major electricity suppliers reduced prices, as support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaics, has increased.
However, gas is moderately expensive, especially at the time when heating is most used and therefore consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are expensive all over the country, the change in price of central heating varies from place to place.
The price hike is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an additional 50 kroner per month for central heating since January, while Liberec families will pay an additional 1,000 kroner per year.
Prague residents will also have to bear a 9 per cent increase in the price of water and heating, especially in the event that the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the Praguens will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will increase by 7.4 per cent.
They can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 rented apartments in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, will increase rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will bring to court those who do not agree with the new rent.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase next year by up to 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer so, because it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers to end up in medical care at less than fifteen years of age.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get them drunk."
"Now fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," says the head of pediatrics at Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán, to Právo.
"When they get a bottle from their father from the cupboard, it may be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage that it is lightened with juice and that it does not smell so much," he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokesperson for the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use spirit they caught at home," adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, 13- and 14-year-old drinkers usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"It started when she was twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, as well as a mixture of ecstasy," says the department's doctor on this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother was not surprised that his daughter disappeared 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the parents' lack of interest or even their clear tolerance for drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, dependency cannot be spoken of as such.
"Alcoholism means a person who has been chronically dependent on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to spokesman Jurinová, forty drunk children were hospitalized this year at the paediatric clinic in Motol until mid-November.
However, the statistics show only those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the mobile medical examination, go home to parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to cases where children simply gather after school and drink spirit, there are three seasonal ups and downs for Pelikán: witch day, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for the bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the vacation."
"On witch day I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at once," Pelikán adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided with the injection of a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
"These are doing much better, because after the agitated night, they get up well and don't hurt at all."
"They are only confused about where they are," Pelikán says, adding that patients often lose their good mood at least when they see the costs they have generated.
The ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a serious patient room cost about ten thousand crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when during the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend all summer in a job for young people to earn enough to pay for that night," adds Pelikán.
Health insurance, in his view, perhaps as a retrogressive measure, which usually pays people back the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of drinking children.
Two L-159 aircraft are first in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time that such a device has been in the hands of anyone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for practical or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seater.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the broker of the sale, Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peješk of the Defense Press Department indicates that it is not yet known when Vodochody's aircraft will be physically withdrawn.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the aircraft repaired long ago, with no additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The two-place L-159T1 were exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army did not run out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody in the amount of 200 million kroner for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seater aircraft.
One of the new planes was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS promised that the aircraft would be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and will serve as pilots for NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this context," says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa plane and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a bid for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense management states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24 aircraft, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by issuing a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than annular indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than annular are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to the age of 60," said co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger may help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly if this characteristic is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indica finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same chance of prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
For men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men with ages below 60 per cent the reduction reached 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that he does not feel that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "proved completely".
The Czech Republic under snow: the D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday covered with snow.
The roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and snow-slip machines circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several industrial vehicle accidents and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
At kilometer 91, a truck broke down, in 93, two commercial vehicles crashed and injured.
Also several passenger cars ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
Drivers must move slowly after Brno at km 190 or through Brno and enter at km 182 in Kývalce.
Several kilometres of traffic jams have formed there.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
For example, traffic jams are forming in Prosek, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně airport closed from 11 o'clock on Wednesday night until 5 o'clock in the morning.
It is now possible to travel on most roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brněnska snow tongues are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will be opened to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region, which, as a protected natural area, must simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimetres of snow, as indicated by ČTK.
In the Czech Republic they fell between two and ten centimetres of snow, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cape reaches 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfalls gradually respend in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" would make their victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely accurate aim.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains cause it to actually function as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point on its ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, wall or trench.
No doubt, normal protection cannot be used and, when you launch your murderous metal chip shower, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of sight and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pulled, the weapon is loaded and the projectile is fired at a distance of 543 meters, plus less than one, two or three meters," Audette says.
400 jobs moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the giant computer sector and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their former office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will stay there.
The offer is highly attractive, in addition the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
Besides, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The bright connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday brought joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against it.
Frankfurt Head of Economics Section Markus Frank (CDU) said that he has earned a Global Player.
This is a "magnificent site recognition."
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the city earlier about his intention.
"We have naturally offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, the economic motives produced the fall.
In such a way, there is now a large empty place to fill in the famous post.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu on the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of Marienbader Platz's remaining buildings for ten years of a controversial spa town construction project.
As a joint project of the city and of a private company of projects between the station and the city council is formed a new entrance to the city, which is in charge of the criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the spaces as parking spaces and regarding the level of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and valuation companies, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, and then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu home computer manufacturer, were installed.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, originally from Tokyo, is recognized as the world's third largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides accurate services.
The branch office in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, yet Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name refers to its star-shaped plan, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
The anguish is taking hold more and more of Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Political pressure may be behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly detained in England.
Wikileaks' revelation platform is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, must be detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks ejected from Amazon's server."
"Speaking freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations communicated through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon service website in order to cope with the high numbers of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we will spend our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported on a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Council for the security of the country had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I had wanted Amazon to take these steps before the previous Wikileaks classified information publications," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and inconsiderate Wikileaks process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," he said in a statement by the independent senator.
"No responsible company, American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has consistently described research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson stated in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange's safety is feared, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to North American statements.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the person responsible for Wikileaks revelations must be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, an advisor to the head of government Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange a great dispute grows.
Robert Gibbs, US President Barack Obama's spokesman, called Assange's request for the resignation of the secretary of state "ridiculous and absurd," should she be responsible for ordering diplomats to engage in espionage duties recently.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed as an exceptional manager, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms" that are necessary in light of Wikileaks' leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
Ice cream college.
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream is prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
From the gelatire and the gelatium.
Gelatire makes cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream making art.
The gelatium takes the cream from the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the jar and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special more days courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in the house's own ice cream shop.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this California art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in a few years in an entangled job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste, but also its silky softness and good consistency are decisive.
Luciano does not forget his formation nor the cream cover of the national superior house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the faucet of the machine and come out a basic pasteurized white cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stalizer?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that they miss the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", perhaps has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar bean.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite a sonic iced granite.
Certain variations in the basic mass are permitted.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
Besides, there are powders and pastas.
"All suppliers will try to strain aromatized ingredients into their merchandise."
"Yet you must experience it sometime."
Be it with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now course participants can use the ice cream ovens.
Luciano lets them make every time four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better doesn't necessarily depend on you having more tofe aroma or more fruit puree.
Hazelnut ice cream does not need to taste like nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group produces kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the flavor of ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream is a problem of artimetics: Peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream it takes an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano draws an utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the types of fruit (measurement of the wine grower for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately the tables facilitate the account.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
It not only helps the utensil for the automatic elaboration of the basic mass.
There is also a utensil, in which the mixture of prepared ice cream is simultaneously beaten and cooled at below-zero temperature.
In spite of everything, all automation is left out as far as small pasta is concerned.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if he were an uncontrolled mini-first giant.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it's just a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European food safety authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently being formulated by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for the independent evaluation of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, head of Efsa's group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to Efsa's testing standards for genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ilsi's situation and imitate the deed of the company, which is in fact controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
So, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without support or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the Environment Office as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some from the industry, are used, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, and ordered in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But you must expose these contacts.
Kuiper supports his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the commission of Lobby.
On this subject, independent experts, such as Then, criticize the fact that GM plants are currently allowed without researching animal food and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not proven.
"We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how will they be found?" asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck is of the same opinion.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not generally published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has gotten some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was at Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind my back.
There were demonstrations.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was wrecked.
Rotate into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You must not disappear."
He gets excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smelled smoke from cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or send it to the dump," he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He spoke to the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downing.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-pound dungeon cut, with a price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half of it is still in the forest, the rest of it has been sold for a long time.
Gardener, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and over.
Stuttgart's stone of impulse has long become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political component."
He ascends to his SUV, makes a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And she's a stone lover.
It accommodates 4,000 tons of stone.
He carries his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the biggest ancient stone dealer in the country.
Slow down.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones minced.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke Bridge," he explains.
Caliza alba, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
It points to a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Bonito travertino."
Formerly the Mazizos belonged to the platform of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the church Sankt Blasien, toba from Heilbronner hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple rigging and a wagon, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to do to the stone dealer, in addition to stone cutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a stained glass maker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the man who takes care of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Talent struggle around great potentials
There's an active influx in the buffet.
16 students gather around the buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a sort of ideas contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, gather in a full-bodied struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: Hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on the skills of their students, attempts are made to capture and capture exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the project at Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium earns its talents.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, gums and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the excited young talents the internship programs and the jobs for students and shows them his ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University runs the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, watch more closely the interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
"The main point was previously in the technical projects," says Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly skilled workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacant engineering posts in October.
And, according to VDI prognostics, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for talent hunting.
It organizes expensive contracting events, such as the KPMG race, a modern type of yincan, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the mass."
"The simple journey alone was short on our own."
For the Dykta talent scout, the notes give results.
"Until today we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
"Some people are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized companies, classic with their work fairs.
"We try to get students at specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, who is in charge of personnel for Solarworld's solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
Currently, there are 35 vacant posts on the company's website.
"It is being very difficult to fill the vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several colleges, such as Freiberg University.
"Teachers advise that you can do internships with us or perform your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: Personal environment, plain hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium cannot normally offer it," says Stübe, the personnel officer.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The key factors are flexible working hours, child care or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld holds 55th place among Germany's top 100 employers.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the preconditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in her ranking for her job seekers.
"I think the applicant especially looks at the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies to want a long-term strategy that earns a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves," he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Employer Branding internal, also promoting corporate identity within the staff itself.
"Satisfying employees are the best ambassadors."
When people are well treated and identified with the company, then promotion is obtained directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Perforations
No new oil drilling has appeared in recent years from the coast of the state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby annulled its previous plans in an unappealable manner.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast remain new perforations closed for the moment.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will be in effect for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform Deepwater Horizon in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the biggest environmental catastrophe in the US, President Barack Obama had admitted new drillings in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce US dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
Until today it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable oil slick in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Later, various oil tanker consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible supervisory authority, which has been accused of corruption charges has fallen into discredit, has been reformed at the root.
Obama also announces that the lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction in the Gulf will be less thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by the BDO advisory company - before Wednesday's mining ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are continuing at an early stage, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water in the rivers is a clear oil, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude have destroyed nature in Ogoniland Nigeria.
People live off the theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine with it.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
You can't see brown oil stains floating on the surface.
Here I used to catch a bunch of prawns, explains Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland through a broken pipe.
Fish from around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: That, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinking regions in the world.
On the path of the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, which dips its hand in the water, will bring out some full of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain are flocks of birds sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier of the outside is silenced, there expands in it a sort of ghostly calm of a former paradise with smell of gas station.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
A war comparison should be made.
The area of the Ogoni settlement has been a battleground for years: Here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here was organized the first resistance in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the oil employees.
Even today, companies are banned from returning to Ogoniland: While pumping more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters steel platforms stood out as bizarre water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most have total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, says Akpobari, then flows a constant stream of oil into the water.
According to experts' assessments, more than two billion litres have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the wreckage of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the long-lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see the heads about to break and leak pipes as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally in the world the conventional ones, the scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the fault rates of the pipes are "about a multiple greater than elsewhere".
In one place, which from afar seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire flames: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil heats up in the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, gasoline penetrates through pipes into the container, later the oil pipe drips and eventually comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-litre diesel daily: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about $22.
Delta dwellers take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per litre illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "bunkers" who trucated the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million liters of oil are lost a day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only an insignificant part of the temporary raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the best part in cisterns and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate purely academic about whether the environmental catastrophe is due to the management of the population or the loose way of production.
"If the oil companies did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, theft, or illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are shattered mostly by Shell to the point that only one deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like the Chinese one."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's about time you disappeared," says muscular Ölmann.
"Soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special unit of the army catches illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
"This damned invention has completely shattered our country," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the investigators found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus who made an emergency landing in early November were far more fortunate than you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s as a result of their investigations, alerting them to a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue or crack cracks can cause cracks, ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among those is the Qantas-Airbus which had to make a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal measures against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit with the Sidney Federal Court that allowed for more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
At the engine mark they have lost parts and their wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type from gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from all over the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will perform more safety tests on super jumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesperson.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines held approximately three of its 11 A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double decked plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes chaos in traffic
Totally white Germany: From day to day it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in road accidents.
Winter Ices Germany: Nearly the whole country reached freezing temperatures on Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a 15 centimetres thick layer of snow.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snowslides are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects live tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the Meteorology Service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimetres of newly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are in charge of swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt police authorities reported major disturbances in the streets.
In the A2, snow and wind paralysed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the trees fallen on the lanes or the broken catenary and the holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia a train ICE had to stop his trip to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service served the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
The snow winds sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport, there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The snowslides are in continuous operation.
However, there are few stranded passengers at the airport, despite that there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
On many streets, Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a crossing in Ostholstein.
The engineer was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snowy streets: Also here a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died, after turning her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become softer and dusty and will therefore swirl in gentle gusts.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and rapid winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to one article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank arranged its headquarters: The twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt bank neighbourhood; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of reonvation, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland states on the basis of a spokesperson.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the project sale.
"We always check whether we should own the properties or sell them and then re-rent them," he said.
This is why Germany’s largest credit institution is once again resigning its company’s headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a house fund and then made the necessary arrangements.
Energy reforms reached a figure of approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the famous newspaper towers as "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
If renovated buildings are sold at a bank fund or to an independent investor it has not been disclosed at present, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people grieving for the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were presumed dead after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Nearly two weeks ago, an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was inserted into the place of misfortune, but it discovered no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to go down for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Currently, family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shining glow of the sun on Greymouth on the southern New Zealand island.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In homage to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under clothing and surfboards.
The flags waved to half a staff in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand expected the miners to return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to fall, Gary Knowles, the superior of the police, told the journalists.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does Gore fit into art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the genre again with his epic battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior imprisoned with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and tear their enemies' guts out of their bodies alive when in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, doesn't say almost any words throughout the film and the other characters get carried away by at least one or two phrases or a couple of grieving deadly screams.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the scenes offer to the Viking world approximately a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for filmmakers grown up and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has multiple target groups it is a shame that they cannot be dismissed from each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the drug-dealing hairstyle "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works go to all audiences with some more humor in the mainstream or something less brutality of the art house.
A brain mass and guts that sprout cannot deter most of the followers of artistic cinema.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christioner missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shuts up again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, a piece of sometimes exciting cinema is hidden, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no way out for viewers.
Refn is condemned just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy soundtrack of trance make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, that from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a little blond boy, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents the perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to give its opinion on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the midnight of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers away is Dayr as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it deals with a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley coming out of the river.
According to information from the CIA's international intelligence service of late April 2008, an ordinary reactor is designed under the name of the proximity of the very appropriate Kibar for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are constructed.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves other purposes than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
The reactor had been in operation for a short time, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely more known than then, the riddles became bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor at the Kibar, but that he saw little sign that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more prudent and only speak of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer in a stoning manner that the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions."
The Syrians quickly disposed of the rubble of the alleged "unusable military building" and opened the ground to conscience.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium rakes in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by individuals.
In addition, IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state from commercial vendors at the time of the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA had submitted.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after particle analysis.
Since then Damaskus has refused to discuss it, as well as satellite imagery.
In addition, the controllers are forbidden a second inspection at the Kibar and entrance to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel, too, keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and “has progressively become a serious credibility problem for the authorities”, as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place at the IAEA in Vienna, a serious violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, to which the IAEA is responsible, is finally pending.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not so far made public what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they appear to be suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as an intern, again derived from the vicinity of the towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, Isis, identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite imagery, most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly on or immediately next to a military base, Syria prohibits the entry into all three locations of the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that Syrians fear a record that the U.S. has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert about the teams thanks to the U.S. Secret Service warnings.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has indications that material is moved between the three sites and the cube on the banks of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a senior position in Vienna said that at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production."
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or refurbishment; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
Since the hundreds of trucks have disappeared from the ground, no one has information about where the rubble remains.
IOAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometres from the Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste area, to be unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that Syrians made land movements in the three suspected suspected locations and removed large containers after IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that IAEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which Syrians would allow, to maintain possible military secrecy, only deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors ' interest.
In the meantime, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured by the fact that the reactor was already destroyed, which is why the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, uses so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitant.
This road is very risky: this requires a majority of the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in the Times of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the address of her debut still unnamed.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosniac women's associations have protested quickly, which at the last moment moved some days of filming planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
He's not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There are no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's position on it tells the victims enough about the script.
Her organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended the removal of Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, granted after a strip and loosens a recording permit in Sarajevo, it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, gets very hard into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different circulates on the net: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and they meet again when she, a Muslim Bosniac, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim falls in love with torturer."
It is certain that Jolie's film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
Currently they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here.
It's finally good for the Irish again this afternoon.
No sign of distress
On the other hand, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans shout with joy as loud music rumbles, they hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the Southerner Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quirky drinking game and the discreet computer actually don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with that, distracting himself from the fulminating question, what the future will hold for him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "he pulled the job of his dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, her brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in Londrés.
Young people leave: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, forecast economic experts and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin.
Until 2015, 200,000 migrants are counted.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, there comes a migratory wave comparable to that suffered by the island in the eighties.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, the melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses above all the young, well-trained Irish, for whom everything has so far been uphill.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young migrants, complaining that: "In Ireland everything is sinking."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it a whole generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union sees a bleak future coming because the government is only dedicated to montage and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they don't have strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
Observe how his companions go from unremembered practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to run your career," says the manager.
On his website are pictures of one boy surfing in Australia and another one snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in galleys, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something elsewhere.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now they're setting up a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he went to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only rarely because he works overtime to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as it was a long time ago that he stepped on the threshold of his home.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am never so well."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with neat gardens facing the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours more hot tea and says, "I don't have children I have to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he hears often today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughs and tells of his father, that in the last great economic crisis he went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's already worked in London for a couple of years, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend in New Zealand do well?
But in these days there is one thing that bothers him very much: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he might degenerate into a farewell party.
"Only, not too much emotion," he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Goodbye, it sounds very distressing."
"We'd better call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies, continues to increase.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related issues are highlighted in the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the relatively lively mood prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see figure 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (figure 3).
About 34 per cent stated that they trusted their country ' s Congress and 45 per cent trusted their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been sustained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty was only marginally rising in 2009 and has fallen again this year to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
Such sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since the polls began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see figure 5).
Some 31 per cent say that, whether they or a close relative, they have been the victims of crime in the past year, a figure that has fallen since 38 per cent last year and is the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private companies and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private companies are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of those surveyed in Venezuela are of the same opinion (and 80% support private companies), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises the greatest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Garbage elections
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went far worse than foreigners were afraid of trying to help the country back in the wake of its problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the sewers, destroyed polling stations and acts of intimidation.
The polling stations opened late hours.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to find out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that it was "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community stated, with caution, that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the outgoing unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tie-breaker is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for the elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former First Lady, have withdrawn their initial petition requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if any, has moved on to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic was raging the country and more than a million earthquake survivors continued to live in tents, a large abstention was expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has become clear, so do the Haitians themselves.
Pushing tiptoe towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, she has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
In spite of everything, that can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the extra income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following Kirchner's death as a result of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Mrs. Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore be implemented next year, which will give the president an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1 per cent, but many private estimates, in addition to the wage demands of trade unions, place it at about 30 per cent.
Mr Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now moderate these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its staff members claim that they want to limit salary increases next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a forced pre-restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as usual.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the prelude to cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to remain in politics when she finishes her term of office, given that she no longer has her husband at her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has been tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have declined.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, calmly, many of your husband's policies.
Half hurrah for China
Voters in Taiwan are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, came on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what seems to be a comprehensive assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a defender of sentiments for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but almost.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five municipal elections, he failed to obtain a majority of the votes.
Instead, the progressive democratic Party (PPD), which has opted for full independence from Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it were the presidential ones, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the PDP tied up with the KMT in the city halls.
In the elections you could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with banners and light girls dancing clothes.
There was also the mysterious attempt at rigorous murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passer-by.
The funny thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or to avenge the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PDP and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not addressed.
Instead, the candidates spoke of public accommodation and job creation plans.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests the military threat from China.
Therefore, the KMT tends to avoid publicizing its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PDP also avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma stated that it had been confirmed that his policy towards China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to return Taiwan to the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but first things first.
It will be best to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to pass.
In any case, the PDP has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on charges of corruption.
Between 2000 and 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs.Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PDP is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been welcomed as a PDP candidate for the presidency, as has Her Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
His party is now doing its utmost to demonstrate that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PDP and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that the PDP candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the PDP will have difficulty choosing from among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also conduct an examination of conscience.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will restructure his cabinet as well as local teams.
Large PDP samples suggest Taiwan's support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy Nominations: Jazz Singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Revelation Artist.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys' surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the Best Revelation Artist category.
Taking into account that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since her 2008 album, "Hope", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the Grammys' rules that he should be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly marked a breakthrough and, taking into account his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop influences, funk and Latin rhythms, can at least make a distinction between Spalding and the road to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have recently focused on the jazz arena for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent album that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley with "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite strident in New Orleans and regular guest in HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans considerably towards fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy's wild punk James Argue's Secret Society earned well-deserved recognition in the big group category, competing against Billy Childs Ensemble's great camera jazz and the ever-dangerous Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of bassist democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in Best Direction of Classic Albums
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The nominations of classical music are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for the symphonies #3 and #4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" of Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan for "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt symphony 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, of approximately 30 minutes, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for her to play in mandolina Avi Avital, which performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was nominated in the orchestra performance category for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists nominated include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The mosque proposed in Temecula obtains the approval of the commission of ordering
The mosque project for Temecula has obtained the unanimous support of the local government commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and jams.
However, the members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from the aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha'is, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loudly."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time it was devoted to people who interceded for or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"The United States no longer exists," reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the apes with Mrs.Freedom dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Plans to build Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmonush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living together for years smoothly in Riverside County, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe poses the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that arsenic can use as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, although it is little short of a truly 'alien' type of life form," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in Thursday's online edition of Science.
For a long time, there have been considered to be six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have found that bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, at which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated a great deal of speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "does show is that in other planetary environments, there might be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the investigation team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element by another in biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high arsenic levels.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, to put it another way, it's weighing down biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing levels of arsenic, to which they were able to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic in its place raises the possibility that a form of life that uses arsenic may naturally exist, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example had never been found to prove that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early ages of Earth, he said, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there might be other ways of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Stolen dogs missing from Compton have been found.
The two missing dogs from the four stolen dogs have been found in front of the Bellflower motel, according to L.A. County Sheriff's officers on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, in front of Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met on Wednesday evening, late at night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They're back with their rightful owners."
Whitmore didn't want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the area competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were to be shown in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's practically two-month tour by taking part in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their room window.
They were carrying three other dogs (a boxer's baby, a terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they had a very thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen Tuesday morning at 6:00 a.m.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, endowed with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally achieved green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the creditors' "pre-armed" plan to clear approximately $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and releasing movies and TV programs.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM's reliving under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a small study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In reality, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the Moelis and Co. investment bank was hired to give advice on the management necessary to manage its finances, while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in recovery of bankrupt companies, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the study's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion sought by creditors.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal debate and disagreements, was finally backed by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will get a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper's companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive $4 million in "success fees."
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and collected an annual board of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of $265 to $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of its gift budget
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed perhaps by the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five 99 dollar BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 Play-Doh cans.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been working; this year's tech toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less than last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most well-known of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button-powered toys are increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are teddy toys the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when their belly is squeezed.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you begin to tighten, you cannot stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-change games like Simom Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative wheeled articulated feet with locking device.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a boy from the 80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a ride into a car in a session with a slide self-correction exercise book.
If you are suspicious of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although games don't teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years), it is the first major set-up of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, from 3 to 7 years) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and ebooks, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to assemble words by placing the blocks in a row before the time runs out; it is formidable for an improvised competition of word-arming.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy shops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, 6 to 12 years old) which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credit at the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of button-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of law and order maintenance in China is promoted
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous persons in his charge, issuing orders quietly with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, China’s corpulent urban order police, feared and despised by their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Shut up!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "How are the pretty girls!"
Four girls who barely spent their teens wearing white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to attract attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with bows with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they look normal," said Mr Tang, scornfully.
"The models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
Guangdong Province changed the greyish green color from uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a dismal snack cart, and watched it frown constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically elected for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's scant respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from Hubei Province beat a passerby to death after using their cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how to effectively whip criminals without causing them to bleed.
This year, a traveling watermelon salesman from Shanghai suffered brain damage after a brawl with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, presents Chinese-trained inspectors who attack street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar in the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleaning."
Skeptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested eight new female recruits through a notice in October, an editorial on The Beijing Evening News wondered if women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's announcement called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features."
They should have a height above average, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Withdrawal at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over 25.
"His image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
The female Chengguan are like vases, he said, and added, "Besides being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to support that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job advertisements for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not appear.
"We cannot allow a person to catch or hump a person to come and work here," said Mr.Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrol Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his red cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her looks is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old working partner with dimples, Xu Yang, said, "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also don't oppose their work on time, they said, because they have higher career ambitions than simply driving out vendors in the alleys where they're supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or bicycle, trying to sell as many buns or tofu bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman ran off on foot, temporarily leaving his bicycle-drawn car with noodles.
The officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' merchandise.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after the false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had murdered a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the evening episode; 14 government vehicles were either overturned or set on fire.
For the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calmness is barely guaranteed.
Only two blocks away from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike shouted rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, made way for the elbows to their vehicles and left quickly with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squadron, remained behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr.Li with total naturalness.
"Most of the time it's the public who starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not press charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's attorneys announced Wednesday that DOJ prosecutors have exonerated Senator John Ensign from the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the wife's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the affair scandal had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he was "surely pleased" by the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plan to bring charges against him on this issue."
The Department of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mail and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the lobbying law for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared to disagree with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the status of a revolve door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks to its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop the prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens, amid procedural misconduct charges.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's main attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a DOJ attorney on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in trying to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which claims that a $96,000 payment from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The election commission said it didn't have enough evidence to prove that the money was just a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a job through lobbying thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "macking" the Ministry of the Interior on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the Secretary of Transportation to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair appeared for the first time last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said that the senator expected the ethics committee to follow the example of the Justice Department quickly and conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign wishes to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the proceedings largely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, are ready to reach an official end, with the judge imposing the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have filed briefs in court outlining the arguments for appeals that they will likely occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports on the process, including extensive use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere," and such widespread and immediate saturation with exalting details caused public passions to exert inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appellate judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
First instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying that the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was led by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that the coverage of successful cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general cause for concern about the impact of the new media" on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report stating that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtrooms could make the trials more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes' lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge improperly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
Juries weren't kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a recusal of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually fueled the fire of excitement about the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state."
Your attention to Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly was a ludicrous view that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future proceedings.
But some lawyers said that courts of appeal were often attracted to arguments about the adaptation that was required in court due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their brief, they referred to the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court, which overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to the coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can civics build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invectiveness and negativity, a bit of civicism has been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders did not bring about any progress on the major issues that should be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what they all say, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to gain partisan points.
The Wednesday public meeting of the president's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is barely enough to state that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a trial period, testing each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent evaluations of the meeting by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and deeply rooted to suggest any rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, expenditure, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
The elections arouse party passions, which then become extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are due at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make believe they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
Following Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism about possible treatment of these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continuous bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
"After the things to be done are done, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civics can lead to genuine cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the main event of 2012," he said.
The motives have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and overturn the new health law.
These support lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the cutback in expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the most difficult work in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the issue of the deficit in the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officials elected to the panel, suggesting that there is at least currently little basis or desire for compromise in fiscal matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama about the budget, taxes, and medical care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would bring about change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a stalemate, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Whoever they think is losing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partidism and polarization are now larger than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked American document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracy," and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money that it collects directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority," takes its share as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow mayor, and he blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup ever since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several lawsuits for libel over such accusations.
In September, when he was asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, a joke, a nuisance."
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with criminality have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to claim that the government functions more as a cleptocracy than as a government," the note states.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means 'roof' or protection) passed over by the police, the Federal Security Service (FSS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
" Analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects money from the largest companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that the best thing is to get protection from the MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, the protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed on one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he is a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked at least at the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy's note, which did not occur until late at night Moscow time, will surely cause distaste within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously for a revelation claiming that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, done in such an immoral manner."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to face the past
In a concrete classroom weakly illuminated, with stained and peeled walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Jemeres.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge government, the commander remains popular in this remote former fortress of the Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being challenged at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the story of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations-Cambodia joint court issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Anlong Veng Khmer Rouge, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among former Khmer Rouge, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is creating divisions within families."
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite officials from the Khmer Rouge retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the rank-and-file soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have gained little benefit after the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Justice and Reconciliation Centre, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They were raised without any concept to do business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge when she was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting herself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is difficult because we have to self-sufficiency."
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This didn't do much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers at the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are believed to have died.
During a recent embarrassing afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his house on wooden piles on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She stated that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is reuniting the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea," which is 75 pages long.
It was distributed at Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's secondary school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's link with the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will try."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black soot covered by a tin rusty roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the roadside, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last break, where he would leave a bunch of mature bananas hoping to have good luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's worldwide campaign to protect nuclear material, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the margins of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations were conducted with Belarus in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian investigation facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have retained highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-grade uranium) and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials stated that the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said he was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was carried out by plane.
The US government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the low enrichment uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reservation by 2012, according to the joint declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential easing.
It was stated that "while progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not object to CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading for Guantánamo by Spanish territory, according to the US ambassador in Madrid in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice president of the government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish executive be informed in order "to be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance over the foreign planes passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting took place between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no reservations about intelligence flights across Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" to avoid being "unsuspected piles," says Aguirre on a cable.
Also the then head of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence."
For his part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors," rather than about the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre laments.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that Zapatero's government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government," he says.
The parricida confessed to complaining about being a mother in the network of the "agobio"
The young woman talked about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she used as a child, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the Coruños village of which she is native.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician woman, 30 years old, started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get DNA tested.
It wasn't long before he got to know another courtship.
The one chosen was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, neighboring municipality.
With him he came to live together for a long period.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But from the contents of the communications, you can see that their romance was fractured, that they broke up.
In March 2008 she was alone in Menorca and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset, because I have come to work."
"When I told him it was okay, but of course, now he realizes what it's like to be with the child all day long and not be free to do whatever he wants."
Then, talk about a message to your mobile phone that you just received: "I want you to turn around this month or give me an address to send the child to you."
She complains: "If you don't like me leaving the kid with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back," she says.
In May, he talks about the return to his village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to introduce myself to a job so I don't miss it."
He clarifies that if everything goes well with him, he takes his firstborn.
"He will be with whom he owes, that is, with me, and never in life will I ever think of leaving him again with anyone other than my mother," a dubious intention given his bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly killed on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
"Caesar is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He will go there (the child) to some summer classes, and thus save me some kangaroo pasta."
The 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Albert says he sent you. I don't know what videos to email. Look how when he wants to find me, he has to fuck himself."
The 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan".
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's ahead of me money."
On the Internet there are messages from them on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he called himself "Muki the ex-prisoner."
"Terror to the Galician (heading)."
The last man who lived with her, a jury guard, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the judicial detention centre in Menorca.
The ex officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "nor did he intend to cause any harm to the minor."
Before, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested psychiatric evidence.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP has already seen the general elections because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections tends to double that received in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics, the figure was 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been nurtured by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a deputy - now it has three - while ICV would stay with a deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate event will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its replacement at the head of the Barcelona Diputación, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain a majority or possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be foolish for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they will be able to take the turn in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Populars have also grown up in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by officers of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "operation Kampai" Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus has been "weakened" internationally and, "therefore, its operational capability".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to groups that make up the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The established cell is not the only one the jihadist network had in operation in Europe, hence the fact that in addition to the Thai services, other European police units have participated in the investigations, so it is not ruled out that in the EU territory similar blows are carried out in the next few days to the one developed in the night last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were arrested), another one was developed in Thailand with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who led the cell from Bangkok in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents had to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
The investigation highlights that, for the time being, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia some $1,000 were sent through a transfer agency that was "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized a lot of documentation.
The PP demands that Mas park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and without philo-sovereignist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to propose in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the assurance that she has obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to make herself want, since the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the investiture vote.
The future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress at the time of general elections depend on a possible understanding with the PP, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has with the rest of the political leaders are held in Catalan.
And as far as the PP president is concerned, in order to support an investiture "all sovereignist and independentist discourses will have to be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated regional administration and eliminating the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center do not rule out that their warder killed more than 11 elderly people.
The leaders of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while he was there killed at least eleven elderly people he was in charge of.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the center's lawyer, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's wish would be to be able to prosecute the person responsible" for the deaths but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil perpetrators".
In addition to the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the guard, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the order ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was sent by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, yesterday flatly denied this point and pointed out that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is not a single indication in the case that there has been reckless action by anyone other than the defendant himself."
The already baptized "Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 for, a month and a half later, to kill a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by OD'd insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping himself with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to medicines.
The insulin punctures and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the tests being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, if she burned them inside giving them bleach as she has already confessed she did with the three women she killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the guard, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, with success, eight murders.
That is why they say that they put themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the extent of this event.
ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday warning "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Peripheral differentials have closed hard and the shares of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
Nor, however, should we underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely picked up which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses recovers but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take a long time to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan as ineffective and the elimination of all extraordinary term liquidity measures and leaving only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis we expect you to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond buying program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be forced to withdraw liquidity measures, God help us!
As at their May meeting in which they stated that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and the markets collapsed, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a further collapse of the market.
Yesterday the one-year letter auction in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, the rates in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, figures for the hole in Allied and Bank of Ireland have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech in order to relax the tension in view of the forthcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four stations in Vivaldi.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Banco de España has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Aid Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available than triple that in March, at very expensive rates and closes you access to the markets sine díae.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being so, seem it."
Cheer up, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm does not abate in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "full null", the judicial board of El Enebro on the 16th, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are refining the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute over control by the group.
The founder of the largest holding company services to the company does not seem willing to give in in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was dislocated by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' meeting on January 18 of this year and whose challenge is noted in the Mercantile Registry.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next 16th, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunder within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to determine the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants their five children to, by procedural argument, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null meeting of January 18", according to their official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the meeting, once held, to proceed to its challenge by considering it to be "full null."
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully attempted to have the magistrate convene a board in June.
In El Enebro, a stock company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, however, the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge after the hearing on the challenge motion, for which there is still no date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
A software designs improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship everyone bet on the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without detracting from the ability as a driver of the final champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor from the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from the high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains for manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding faults and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and in trials.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to make a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements during each season.
The Red Bull team today employs 180 young high-skilled professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the tanks.
Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of the Red Bull boosters with the exception of the engine, which is the entire responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation of this technological improvement madness is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its fires in a locality about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The staff for this task amounts to 580 people, including their two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula One hero is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, are hidden other protagonists whose contest is invaluable and its notoriety null.
The head of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R & D advances in wagon cars contributed 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology adds 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive shop in collaboration are its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will reconcile this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP España, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remodeled shop located in the Gran Vía Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open was Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of the shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP computer equipment in warranty.
An online service connects to a technical centre located in Maastricht, Netherlands.
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it foresees a collapse of interest margins, which will be partly offset by increases in fees and credit prices.
Sabadell hopes to attract in three years a million private clients, his pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
In addition to surviving without having to resort to FROB's public aid, the aim is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if they are counted those who can leave the bank -, their great outstanding subject, since until now it had pampered SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5 per cent, while in companies it exceeds 10 per cent.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with reduced costs as a goal, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year his Optima master plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation made it extend it one more year.
Customers who let the savings banks slip away will be their main target.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, while he believes that the war on liabilities - which penalises margins - is falling, the price of the risk premiums that banks and banks are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity are already moving to the credit price to compensate for the drop in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and finance is structural, and it's going to be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto already gave Thursday orders to his network to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the spreads - see FiveDays of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now "is to raise commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "greater sizes will be required."
"Next year it's going to move everything," he said.
He claims that capital needs are "highly elevated" and does not rule out any Spanish financial institution entering red numbers.
He points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds in the face of new recapitalisations.
Having ensured that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he underestimated what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He pointed out that it could not be issued, but contrary to what had happened in June, short-term financing could be obtained through repos, thus cushioning the crisis.
ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the cash markets
The CEO of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out a wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When it started the process of concentration of Spanish savings banks, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and supervised by the Banco de España, which has collaborated a lot in that too," said the director.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the process of concentration is taking place "at the fastest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is occurring in the deadlines that in his day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Banco de España", emphasized.
"To move from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion asset volume to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to meet Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Banco de España does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The CEO of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The director said that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "is going at the fastest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the entire Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of assistance to unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of Lotteries of the State.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How do you interpret these movements?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about the three possible solutions to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of herself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary area.
The second is the recovery of the framework, although it now seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third is a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines for transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of hand to prevent them from beginning in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece's rescue decision.
He was already the object of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, once again Merkel emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties, in order to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the process of reform of the Union that will enable those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although we must now take measures with which he may not agree very much, from that date the old operation of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely punished, they can be forced to declare themselves suspended and, in this case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The delivery is clear.
And we would do wrong not to understand it.
It is not just a question of bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater tranquillity.
And let's take advantage of the window of opportunity we've been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the thesis that order must be put at home has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn't look like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, the possibility of leaving a monetary area too crowded with unserious countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and fraud of law
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but will not escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly ordered by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behavior is anti-sportive and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team already had clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in taking faults to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next game of the league, against the Auxerre, and they will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned with two matches the team's coach, José Mourinho, and with different financial amounts the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but in a row, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the case reported is because it has been led by a team from the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem presumes of nobility and honor, and which in past times has fined its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit fraud by law; for, in fact, they are actions that respect the sports regulations, but seem to circumvent their meaning.
The question is what kind of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with fair play is to prevent the offending players' team from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
However, the paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is that they did not conform to what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud of law, since their violation of the rules was not made in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely their action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage offenders gain from intentional misdemeanours examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the rival is not put in a disadvantageous position nor is profit obtained in the same game, since obviously the result of the action involves leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, as the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated at the first of the changes, and also with this performance the players fulfill a penalty game and move to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension due to accumulation of cards occurs with a less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor making the most of what the rules allow.
In the case before us, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without circumventing the punishment or running away from it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I believe it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to catch group Christmas dinners at BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
The self-suffocating celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, are widespread.
Like the turrón and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to attract the majority client: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed coincide.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year's calendar (on the fall of New Year's Eve on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has already happened since 2008, when the skinny cow stage began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners due to budgetary issues.
In order not to do without tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the bosses, today, does not dare to predict what the celebrations of this month will be like.
"People think about it long before they book."
"He wants out but has the alerts on the issue of prices," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to lower a step with the crisis, so that the strip around 25 euros has become majority in demand.
A survey in various central establishments shows the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is a real boom of applications for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros", they detail.
In AN Grup, which is the flag of El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to 23 locales, they remain optimistic after detecting a turnover boom from the second semester and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends that precelebrate the holidays.
To their six group menus have added one Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, like cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that again invite their employees and feel that the volume of groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the bosses Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reserves are "animated", although the customers "business to the maximum".
However, the illusion for the celebrations has not gone down, whoever pays, it indicates.
Pakistan’s nuclear program generates great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked through the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between the two countries on atomic security, rather than increasing, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for development in Washington.
This is listed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of then National Security adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and as a reason to keep watch.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with his American counterparts.
The most novel of the documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the declining cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high pace of Pakistan's production of nuclear weapons.
An embassy office in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," argues: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of help are left unanswered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the person responsible that "the Pakistan Army must put an end to tacit support for terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks chief
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorist officer to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Moreover, it is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it doesn't have to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks creator Mark Stephens' lawyer says that "the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as the organization has explained, do consider the so-called network free way to proceed to an arrest -- which should be undertaken by the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, has been willing to respond by videoconference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's chief of security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal pursuit," the letter denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains unaccounted for, but not silent.
On Monday he gave an interview from an indeterminate location to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign," he said.
His opinion was denied yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the petition for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist officer, Russell Travers, to prevent further document leaks.
President Barack Obama's attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with views proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January onwards, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue any contribution or aid."
Even further has Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying that Assange should be "murdered."
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Mike Huckabee, the Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor and possible presidential candidate, did not apologize.
"Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," Fox said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks like Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to circumvent the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, with no north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his resignation is insufficient for those related to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as its own mentor and that it can not at all cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councillors of ERC will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
Through ballots, and not by hand.
If the carodists want to vehicular a certain vote of punishment for the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be good a result "to the Bulgarian".
Those close to Carod demand that the president put his position at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But by not having enough majority to force resignations, they're going to try to agree with the executive a road map between now and May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which the management will put to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to advance the congress to autumn 2011, something that the dome already takes for granted.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that "polyphony" harms stability and that its aim is to make the organization once and for all able to wash dirty rags from doors inward.
In this line, the article that the acting conseller Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació assumed that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e. to include new faces coming from the Carod-related sector.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC once and for all liquidate assembly as a functioning mechanism.
It therefore called for a reform of the statutes to enable the congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
To end the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this sense in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the task to the management to review assemblyism in a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years has discouraged us from addressing the issue.
Now, without sectors critical of stalking, it can be a good time to pick it up and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the MILENIO State of Mexico count, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the state of MILENIO state of Mexico.

A day later in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old man, was killed by eight bullets after leaving his home to start garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were finished with a bullet impact on the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, a man's body was found on a lonely road to El Naranjo Colony with the graceful shot on his forehead, and under his body a 25-caliber gun shell was found.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the sewage canal of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán alerted about the discovery of a corpse found in the Peña Colorada site, which was tied hands backwards and with a blindfolded head.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his neck.
In the middle of the month the execution of two men was reported, who were wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in streets of the Villas de la Hacienda division in the municipality of Atizapán of Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found alive in the town of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a man was located in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow blanket with blue, allegedly identified with the name Mario Ríos according to a message his executors left with him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunfire in the back of the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
In the skin of the woman tattoos of the Holy Death were detected, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, a man's body was found aboard a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three gunshot wounds and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with their heads taped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied hands and feet, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first was beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag on streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him the agents found a cardboard with a message.
China Maintains Targets to Reduce Greenhouse Gases
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, a representative of that country at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country had invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
He made it clear, however, that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He noted that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the adoption, last year, of a new Energy Law, which reflects the objectives set in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, several multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, are under way or have already been completed.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for the change of incandescent hotbeds by savers and one for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific advisor to the government of that country on climate change, said that China's efforts have been greater than those generally thought.
For example, he explained, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution in pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years and planning to do so by 2020, abounded.
Legally attached to Espino's expulsion: César Nava
The PAN national leader explained that the former PAN leader has the right to go to the National Order Commission to demand what is in his right.
The PAN national leader, César Nava Vázquez, said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was in line with the law and that the former PAN leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to demand what is in his right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's taking of protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order of Sonora Commission."
"Mr Espino has his right to appeal to the National Council's Order Commission, if any, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the framework of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional will emerge strengthened from the internal election on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The PAN leader said that the PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; the contario "we enjoy it and strengthen us," he said.
He said the council will certainly be able to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence he will hand over the post "to whomever the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, and any of the five would be proud to hand over the party president's office."
He predicted that the upturn the party registered in the last elections on July 4 will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it is not yet time to think in 2012.
"For now it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a subject of observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations."
When questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of the four years of his government, César Nava called on the PRI to reflect on the six-year term of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; that they start defending them; that they leave the closet," he said.
He felt that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no gag or censorship in the country.
Promote Obama on Twitter Law for Undocumented Students
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation," the U.S. president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link with a broader document that asks the public to communicate immediately with the senators, given that the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the fiscal issue had been resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the fiscal issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would ask for a "closing debate vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on as of next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream Law would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have stayed in the country for the last five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, requiring the competition of a handful of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations are actively lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Dream Act supporters therefore need to join several Republicans in case other Democrats choose to turn their back on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's term of office.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have stated that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the wound
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where participants showed the story
"That sex in the tongue I understand but... the finger in the wound? what is expected of me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates Spanish literature and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "puts us in trouble," the Argentine writer waited sweetly to the public, mostly of young people, who met at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "call" is, goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not get answers although she does have clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist he is convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies that sore is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must go very mercilessly.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative entitled Elogio of the invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but is discovered in a moment.
With brush strokes of magical realism, she tells of a famous sorcerer, who touched clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a maiden would have lost, a story that she turned to speak later America, the great novel that her own chroniclers had not missed from the beginning and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
"Cerminators who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that was lacking even modesty."
However, he emphasized "it is the madmen and the liars who imagine best" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that of what is narrated belongs to one side or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
He actually calls it "cervantine tradition."
"By his inheritance we are what is told."
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero narrowed down and applauded the variety of interpretations that gave rise to the invitation of the FIL with its round table The Finger on the Wound.
The Cuban-Puerto-Riqueña pointed hers toward the great scourge of social violence that her country is going through -and she shares Latin America - as a result of the disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
"To be masters of our thinking and to be masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance often means putting the finger on the wound and bothering those people who are much more comfortable thinking of cartoon, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also bothering the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but has managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although until now he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting himself with the medal of the runner-up, has stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist came to his first final as a coach at the 2002 Open Tournament, when he held the reins of the Morelia with which he fell by a total of 4-2 to Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure he also reached the decisive duel and also lost him to a global of 3-1 and went precisely to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again before the Devils, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team ended up tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the batch of penaltis he got in advantage by 3-1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 volterette.
Rubén already lost two endings with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the curse and to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," said the helmman when he questioned him about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very valid has the previous ending, from which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only teaching that we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the previous time, with two penalty throws we were already prepared to run and I think that is a teaching, until the game is finished we can celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shots, something that does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the prison batch, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and one has to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad move fate, sometimes because of the nerves or anxiety to have the title in our hands, but it left us, that left us something for this end that we hope does not reach that instance".
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up technician and to test for the first time the glory given by the titles.
EU changes rules to get visa
People must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASC) before their interview with the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for petition visa cases (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this section less time than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra $26 service fee.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will release tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the one in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA said it will present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures on our side and hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently it is a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and of this ability increases the possibility that similar life might exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "if there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the true extent of the findings at tomorrow's press conference Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), with the prospect that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Opposition 'block' pattern
With reforms to the Congressional Organic Law, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, led by the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrono Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrono Montalvo, 'tronvo' against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it starts the 'bipartisanship', because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by PANista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He explained that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting with a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be attacked again by both parties and that is the end of the opposition coalition.
"So far it has come (the opposition coalition), it is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Pattern, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress after having been monopolistic, now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipathism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that at present Congress became a 'boot' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now it's being split between two."
Patrón Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the Member, to be given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by cupular agreements, let 5 be left out that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, right now the five that see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for the supplier.
It pays Mazatlan City Council another check to the questioned owner of electrical equipment company.
One more check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical material company, amounts to 1 million 200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the State's Superior Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still due and, therefore, how many more checks are still to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you are simply being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, October 15, October 19, October 29, and November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as indicated by the Law when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after that on July 25, Northwest published a review of the cheques issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he cashed cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgen to attend tourist sites
They regret tourist entrepreneurs accident of the foreign tourist due to bad conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Golden Zone Traders Association, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that they take care of the image of the destination and reverse the bad that tourists encounter with new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and turn around the nearby businesses.
"Politics don't know what it's like to close a company one day and have no idea what money is lost, or else they didn't do the works in such a long time and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so by providing preventive maintenance and not just falling into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but also as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Mazatlan Venadito.
"Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"Not enough attention has been given, and this kind of fact reveals something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that it is urgent to rescue tourist sites in Mazatlan, because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that must be put in line with the municipality and be priority to keep the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put on line to make them attractive in order to add them to the inventory that we have to promote the destination."
Ask IP for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CEC, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
A Decent Labor Legislature free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the Mazatlan business sector, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature was installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 deputies from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one from the PVEM, which totals 40 people's representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partyism or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the new 40 state congressional deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies will really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to look after their own interests and become carnival comparsas of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to bring forward the Ruler in turn.
"We see that they come to do a decent job and above all committed to society and to the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow encourage job generation."
As for the tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight that he has within the state budget to strengthen the Secretary of State Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity that generates foreign exchange and investment and that directly competes with the agro industry."
In addition to that it is necessary to label resources to detonating tourism projects and that they help in providing security to the state and in updating the Alcohol Law that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Seeking a Wizard King
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For his parents, next Kings Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Elizabeth, Jesus, Joseph Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, Joseph John and Michael do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and live daily because the father does not have a permanent job.
"Well, sometimes we look tough because my husband has no chamba, but we sell mandarin and dad... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, aspires for a long time to have a 'monster' car and for his brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said 'let's see son', because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children, those in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
11-year-old Maria Guadalupe is size 12; 10-year-old Isaiah is size 10, while 8-year-old Michael uses size eight.
José Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream come true for the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the Search for a Wizard King campaign, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest Reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions took place as part of the dismantling of a Cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of Cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, plotting and stealing services, among others.
These persecutions have followed a long investigation that has lasted for about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to make the arrests," says Mr.Ruel.
This police operation involved about seventy officers from the Quebec Security Estrie investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
It will be possible to combat clandestine migration without problems
The draft law on conservatives, which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of pateras loaded with clandestine migrants, will surely face a great opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that has created the granite you step on," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a vessel identified as transporting clandestine immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also indicated that he could not support the bill because it targeted the wrong target.
"We are against it and, apparently, all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," said Mr Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that her party is not firm enough with clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that measures should be taken against those responsible for clandestine women's kickers, and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35," says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and jails children for a minimum of one year," explains Mrs Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of the position of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they don't tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country like a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," says Minister Kenney.
The Government had not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative told the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request a vote so that each Member who is going to oppose will then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption unit and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Therefore, the announcement on Tuesday has caught more than one by surprise.
It can be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the Quebec party that deals with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of the joker" and as "a last-minute blundering solution."
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest insists on avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the general controller to conduct a poll on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the overall controller," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could give the financial controller the same powers as a commissioner, thus enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent gang is not the only project under way in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to make it better suited to this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this subject.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to biker groups, although the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to the heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, in Maurice.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
Also, an additional 20 to 40 millimetres are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
Sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
As these precipitations add to the snow thaw that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will be overrun.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, 10 residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civilian security unit remains alert and monitors the situation closely, according to Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Centre, for its part, issued Wednesday announcements communicating the strong floods of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partially Blame Dupont
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as for their rude language on radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr.Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inexact information on social assistance, improperly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Council also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two suicide bombers, do not violate broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received a number of complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters should report reliable data rather than misleading them.
In relation to suicide, Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes questioned by Dupont le midi have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any blame has been dropped in this regard.
The last dispute concerned the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had led a media confrontation that had sparked numerous reactions.
The CHOI host stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the use of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio network has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences shall be minimal for the broadcaster, who shall, inter alia, announce decisions once at the hours of the largest hearing within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montereales of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai box, climbs into the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy playing on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of UPS, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) amateur World Championship held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box," he explained.
"I'm currently preparing to take part in the San Shou World Cup in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished among the top four in the world's last championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originally from China in which it is allowed to hit with fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
Clashes are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only maintain a competition in his career, he will certainly attend the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand). "
"It's been an amazing experience."
Zemmal has won his first match, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who has won me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face each other at the end of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Quebec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a tender the most important contract, the one of project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the consortium Énergie gérance obtained the lucrative contract without prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and provoke a rise in prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition."
"That is to say, people, instead of doing it secretly, now do it openly," said the Quebec Party deputy Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can benefit in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was a collusion with this contract.
"I begin to tire," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" way and "with lack of rigor."
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been awarded without competition being involved; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As published last week by Le Devoir, the consortium formula in the technical advice sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's business register allows identifying more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
Regarding the consortium Énergie gérance, Minister Normandeau has emphasized that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular workforce dynamic and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the consortium Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advice contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Énergie gérance contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has implied that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is rather about its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The label "green" does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade marks or ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumption pull, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows down its commitment.
Even if consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of the companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of the consumption responsible of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates bearing so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "correspondable," the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6 per cent of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, the gaps and doubtful nature of the information mean that 46% of consumers discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of the supposed yields of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell to them.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in the shops in their neighborhood and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumer of Quebec loves to occupy the post of the king of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social consciousness seems to be door-to-door (from your car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support bike use and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the cinema complex eXcentris post La Société Angus and El Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back from Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on the Saint-Laurent boulevard and return to him their true cinéfil vocation, have not obtained what they requested.
The Government has agreed to engage in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would, in fact, be lower than initial expectations; this could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a 12.8 million request last spring, but since then the applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report about ten days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have a deadline of 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation should be completely discarded.
Remember that the Association of cinema owners and film complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not fund real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector do call for considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has carried for ten years the burden of author cinema in his premises of the complex, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Council.
The lack of independent film rooms is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to loyalty to its clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are promoting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to screen films in eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen the three halls on February 27, screening the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downside proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted with a complex...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers to be the Canadian complex with respect to Americans, but at the same time reflect the U.S.'s sense of superiority over Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don't think about Canada-United States relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A September 22, 2008, cable, that is, during the full federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This brought great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of almost inherent inferiority to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to speak of."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logically his opinion that the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor on which voters should think when voting."
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, head of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in the federal budget in early February, through which Canada will register a deficit for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40 billion," writes Mr Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition from replacing it or that the opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image of the dramatic series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issuance of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which makes little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable says that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to host some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that he depended "on each case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, "He has delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods have warmed up regarding the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered."
Mike Huckabee is echoed in the United States.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN in Cancún proposed a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by nearly one third of the additional reduction to be carried out to stabilize the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent light bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact light bulbs or, even better, by light bulbs of electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided to enlighten humans.
Lighting accounts for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary vehicle fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, large emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should still be reduced to stabilise, by 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, energy consumption is reduced even twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last for an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above, they don't contain any mercury.
A number of specialists have expressed reservations about fluorcompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers issue instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not fluorcompact light bulbs, but coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted with incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion to build.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," says a spokesman for the head of the UN.
"Call on all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline to pass from Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days since Sunday's scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CIS had told television that the commission "was still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday the world has multiplied the demands that the CIS finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo side is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Ivory Coast, said that the intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's adversaries consider that the highest court in the country is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in the publication of the results to be "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the election commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have set the tone for the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivorian political class that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received publicly the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent on the mainland (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the corrected data with temporary seasonal variations (SVCs) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in continental France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population on the mainland and 9.7% with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and seek employment or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over the age of 50, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with DOMs.
Unemployment has only been stable among people between 25 and 49 years of age, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Since 2006, La Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the framework of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guerini is being investigated for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all questions put to him by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It's easy to chase him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also imprisoned one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done has been to take care of the landfills he has to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the allocation of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to counsel Simon.
In the framework of this file, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the Aubagne urban agglomeration services, has also been investigated for embezzlement and complicity, but has been released on parole and is forbidden to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken account of the explanations and released him," explained his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday to Wednesday, four other people were interrogated and released under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of Marseille Provence Métropole's property (MPM), has been charged with "trafficking in influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "subtraction and embezzlement of public goods by a person engaged in public service" and for "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "cover-up of the abuse of social goods".
Among the people who have faced Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have served to launder the capital of great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several court orders initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the research focuses especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has had the public in France on its mark, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of United States diplomats.
The U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
Describe how the Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "hostages" crisis in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and wanted by U.S. justice for trafficking materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
Eliseo's advisor on strategic issues, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, converse with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continuously release" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more frequently."
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discreet channels have been exhausted, "silence will solve nothing," Iranians are "experts in delaying maneuvers."
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a regular Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day he takes refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros in reward).
In addition, he notes that Eliseo anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "is going to increase."
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the close to 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The American embassy, like numerous observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iranian clandestine nuclear procurement networks, Majid Khakavand's release is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
Eliseo, he says, not only "has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot annul the judicial decision", he says.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
Eliseo's advisor dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elisha spares no effort, uses media-organized communications and "flights" to make it believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role of "mediator."
Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and find that manipulation brings its fruits, as several press articles broadcast the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the reason for this "gratitude" towards Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
"Despite their praiseful statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that have led the Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he says.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been branded premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris tries to "show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The goal is also "to sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confides to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we've thanked him."
"At least this should lead to confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at Eliseo.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirio for having played an "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
From midnight onwards, Korean youth cannot play online
The South Korean government is going to adopt a law called "Cinderella's" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, according to government officials.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to request online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, as indicated by representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, a minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law.
The government also intends to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of the young people so request, added the manager.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free software that allows to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA designates the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints on Thursday the countries organizing the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clear political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Transactions behind the scenes, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the fire on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has exposed three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who have thrown themselves into an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the lead.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had managed to organize the JJOOs in London in 2005.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain England's brilliance before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spanish-Portugal duo also has many strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only succeed in giving points to Russia, turned into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in its candidacy (stations, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against EC members.
"They are bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which had the 1994 experience, seemed to be the most logical favorites.
First world economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new candidates seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the concession of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of TV fees paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had implied he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One mandate in the Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of State will be re-elected in 2012.
However, the evidence does not combine well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, one must always appear to be in doubt.
On one side and on the other.
In 2006, even if they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15th, in earnest tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in autumn 2011".
Therefore, the fact that I deal with MPs on Tuesday night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused a certain stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not at all.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It simply conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he's talked about presidentials, with a jocuso tone, in meetings of this kind.
"In the worst, or better, case, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't ask myself what will come next."
His claims the day before yesterday do not bring him any closer to the candidacy, nor do they bring him any closer.
They raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy on the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone up to the palestra that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
On the contrary, the fact that your candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to demand that the battle be organized ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the issue," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and prudently.
"If he thinks he can lose, he won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations which should end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation in European bond markets today.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in solving the debt crisis of the European States.
He did not want to say whether he considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its government bond buying programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the buying program of State Letters in the secondary market "continue" and that "we will see what we decide" during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to nearly €1.350 billion.
Moreover, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese securities again.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities amounting to €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in direction.
Although lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, it still makes unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial conditions and durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I can't imagine he's going to significantly modify his program."
"If not, he would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, an economist at the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011", anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to intervention in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of such obligations in order to keep the market stable", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a sharp rise in the returns paid by the most fragile states," said an important bond manager yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are skyrocketed, States will have even more trouble reducing their indebtedness, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi’s government weathers the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the fall in the rates of obligations to 10 years.
A recovery from precarious calm.
Upon the departure of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record 210 basis points and the price of the insurance contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing a certain stir in Rome.
On the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is he's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
Italian growth is estimated to reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the government deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour that new budgetary provisions can be implemented after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be adopted," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short term or in the long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, it would open up a period that would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde said this yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already shown on Sunday night and day that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, yesterday's relaxation in the rates of European States' obligations has prompted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower the rating of Portugal's debt, the most frequent target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," says economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the pace of markets."
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries are stepping up discussions to strengthen existing mechanisms for exiting the crisis.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly affected and, in general, with their counterparts in the G-20 are on the right track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin earlier next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began on Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors in the Far East about the new developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly paves the way.
The first issues of EFSF securities are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official representative entrusted Reuters with supporting a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path from that followed by Greece and Ireland.
They both want to avoid at all costs seeking international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms that they consider essential to building confidence in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are considering the options available to speed up the process of normalising the public bond markets.
By the way in Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the €750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently has EUR 60 billion.
A council which could certainly be examined in detail by the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfalls continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the Isle of France.
A layer of snow of between 2 and 5 cm is expected, promptly between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Isle of France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are strong enough to cause difficulties of circulation and affect some economic activities, alert Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited for heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles.
According to the gendarmes, the traffic in the secondary network in Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it should not be driven except in case of need and the movement of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
On Thursday, school transportation in Picardy has been banned.
No specific measures had been envisaged on Wednesday evening to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "calls on all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy Paris airport on Thursday and 10% at Orly due to the planned snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the island of France has reached its peak, billions have rained.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris subway to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To launch this GSP, the State has announced a funding allocation of 4 billion euros.
At the theoretical level, this amount will subsequently allow the GSP to obtain loans on the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The Amending Finance Act of 2010, which was discussed in the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the office tax on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from $4 billion.
"It is necessary that the fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that will be mobilized by the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as explained."
"To be recorded in the budget and used as required".
The GSP estimates that it will begin to receive $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised $4 billion is not included in the credit, can trigger a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avenger hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long given cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret records should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for novelties about the nonexistent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little desire) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, I don't know, editor of the Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the US Embassy of Rome to the State Department was the same as that published by Newsweek the week before.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of States can call themselves by telephone or catch the plane for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have become spy centres.
Any viewer who watches research films knows perfectly well, we just pretend we don't know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, public repetition violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea of anyone being able to consult the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "greens".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in the time of Orwell, he could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as is the case now, that even crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer keep its own secrets endure?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and a lot, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any classified information on the Internet, as it would be like posting it on a billboard in the street.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, you cannot expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State has flown and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is science fiction and, therefore, novel, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly on errands with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at best, hiding some data written on their shoes' heels.
That information is then kept in a single copy in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate's attempted espionage was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the cordless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a telegraph with cables (telephones).
The video tapes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of the editing, while now the CDs (digital) only allow to advance or back from chapter to chapter, that is, to huge proportions.
With the high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the journeys that it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was being secretly plotted in embassies.
At present, it is embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s Shatters in their Financing Pledges
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to consider whether the rapidly unblocked pledges of funding (called fast start or early start) made by developed countries have been honoured.
And the French slugs have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed to providing EUR 7,2 billion over three years and France EUR 1,260 million (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that their commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was an appreciable result and appreciated for what it really is worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2010 €2.2 billion, placing it on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as its reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, France's total amount of aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while respecting its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element is the sharing of donations and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro borrowed is equivalent to a donated euro.
Clearly, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain profitable investments (often emissions reduction projects based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that is to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% grants (36.1 million euros); consult the EU document to see it for your own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France is making a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only €36.1 million, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is relatively short-term in relation to the climate negotiations as a whole.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, however, France could move forward with discussions on the stakes at stake in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional nature" or the method of computing loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move the negotiations forward.
Warning on pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old ingests 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the former movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but they are illustrative of the problem addressed", acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a child of about ten years old usually consumes in four meals and a snack a day.
These model meals, which comply with official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as sweets, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances susceptible to acting as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each chemical are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered as safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that may harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent banned insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the Russian steak, canned tuna and even the bread bar or chewing gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutrient" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk posed by these "pollutant cocktails" to the consumer is "probably underestimated," the study says.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
