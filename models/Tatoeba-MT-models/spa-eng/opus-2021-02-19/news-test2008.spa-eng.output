European inflation slipped into food
Accelerated inflation in the euro area is due first and foremost to rapid growth in the price of foodstuffs.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, recording - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Union Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts only gave as probable 3 percent - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut off the basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "We need to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue at a later stage.
Inflation of 3.3 per cent, recorded in Germany, broke the twelve-year record, while in Spain it rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation skyrocketed in the euro area as a result of galloping food and energy prices.
The end-of-wheat contributions increased by 88 per cent and the soy levy also reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching black gold nearly $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 per cent today to 2.5 per cent, while by 2009 inflation will already fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will continue in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup foresees a government crisis
After a long stalemate, by the beginning of December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its peak since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of safe voters of the parties - due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) compared to support of one-fifth for socialists (20%).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the limit necessary to have any parliamentary scant: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the sure voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison to the previous low point - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
With regard to the next year, the majority of the population was experiencing a deterioration in the situation and only one tenth expected improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of those consulted, a figure higher than any previous Gallup survey, estimated that the President of the Government performed his functions poorly than well.
13 percent of respondents trust or rely heavily on Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán is supported by 38 percent of respondents.
Fifty-four percent of the population doesn't trust the Head of Government at all, and 27 percent don't trust the president of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year, 35 percent thought it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, at present this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33%) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation responded that they would certainly participate and another 20 percent said that they are likely to participate.
By way of comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" it would surely participate only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
Seventy-four per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study fees, 79 per cent of the medical consultation service and 84 per cent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average increase in price levels of 16 percent in the hypermarkets of Budaörs' gold trading triangle was maintained, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the commercial gold triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the newspaper Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth much higher than the thousand HUF.
As prices in food supermarkets had already been "fired" in December last year, this was not the case with a drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price far below the nine thousand HUF, today they cannot do even for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 this basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this shop that the price of the Coca-Cola with redeemable bottle of two liters cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's basket it was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased with 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent of the prices listed in Napi's basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket with that of this year's cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year's cheapest and most expensive basket has been 21 percent this year.
Average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during last year's Christmas in prices the increase in VAT was felt.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade that supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of circulation of a product, he may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of Napi's basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF than the value recorded in 2006, while at the cheapest the difference was only an 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, as the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic increase in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of basic consumer goods grew by more than 30 percent.
(However this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some staple foods, recorded in the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30 percent.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst cases just 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose drastic price increases even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most of the consumers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking by pallets the preserved foods.
On Wednesday morning, in the three stores large queues were formed ahead of the boxes because suddenly the number of customers increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because income falls below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
Several thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals this year, primarily due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions prevailing in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overload of staff do not favour the control of infections - says the doctor-chief of the department of the National Center of Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a MRSA contagion has been diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
One injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, and the same patient soon afterwards had to return to the hospital as a result of MRSA contagion and since then no major surgical intervention has been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the Nosocomialis Surveillance National System - said Karolina Böröcz, department doctor-chief of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents has surely been recorded, and the rest are not reported.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing any disease.
Infections caused by S.A. (e.g. inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is applied exaggeratedly or improperly to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, become highly antibiotic resistant bacteria and quickly contagion under inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicaemia in the first place in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with weakened body, in the elderly, or in people of low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of Hospital János there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistant
"These patients are isolated, they are treated in rubber gloves and mask by nurses and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalised patients are previously screened for MRSA presence in their body, but even so infection cannot be avoided in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of formation and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the sick patients who carry MRSA in their body.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most of the cases come to light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - said the doctor-head of the department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict commitments for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
It is important to ensure that antibiotic therapy is directed, that is, microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of travelling patients or in basic care - Karolina Böröcz said.
Saved with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is spread from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but in this regard, too, there are considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is spread through drop transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favorable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for infection.
In the view of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are taken, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Program Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA contagion is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is fought against in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The program appears to be successful, according to data provided, MRSA infections show a trend of decline in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has as its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of the XXII district.
It can be excluded the possibility that he was driving drunk or in a state stunned since then the resigned commander of the police of the XXII district, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passer-by - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary alcohol control which had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then chief of the XXII district police station, on Tuesday with his private vehicle turning to Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district, ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the area designated for pedestrians.
(This last fact, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when doubling.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police leader resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was greatly moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with the prosecutors responsible for the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian finance minister János Veres and vice president of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed on Friday in Budapest three credit-limit agreements with a total value of 400 million euros to finance infrastructure for education, transport and the environment, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance transport and environmental protection projects in the Hungarian budget, to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund grant, of which the parties had already signed a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The credit agreement of EUR 150 million is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective for Hungary, and the decision on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be taken later when the credit agreement is extended.
The parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million for innovations, which the budget will use mainly for the University of Debrecen's innovation and research project.
During the talks they also covered the topic of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary completes the details of the Metro funding with the EU, they will revisit the issue of whether or not to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this can take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period, with no charge for keeping the credit at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU’s real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country not mentioned above.
What, where and by those who buy in the EU's even cheaper market, which will quickly be expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred objective for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is without a doubt Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments of ski slopes and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches of Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people also search for properties around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Similarly the capital Sofia can be attractive, commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf havens in Europe, thus being a top destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example around Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot developers are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They demand good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important.
The second category consists of buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital estates is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The rise in the price of real estate significantly exceeds wage growth.
Phodor and the six by hundreds Hungarians
As reported by the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, expert-level meetings will be concluded on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration, negotiations at the ministerial level on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world discuss the Bali Road Map, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, until 2012.
There are now lively discussions on this issue between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not wish to negotiate on precise figures at the moment, although it tends to agree that, compared to the situation in 1990, the emission of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020.
Another major theme of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing or unwilling to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be headed by a 16-member steering board, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
The Six by Hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for the Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to retain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed and is willing to commit itself to reducing even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries signatories to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed themselves to decrease by 5.2 per cent, within this the then 15 EU Member States committed themselves to meet an 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce by 6 percent the emission of greenhouse gases with respect to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply with - says the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
Much is at stake in Bali, since the long-term international climate policy agreement will have to be signed in two years' time, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed to after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments made in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, an international scientific association of the UN dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and could not prevent an increase of more than 2°C in the average temperature of the Earth, a fact that scientists believe would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British Army units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: Special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled on Kandahar's general body of operations, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings coming from the air force soldiers who have been charged in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "headquarters defense" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Community of British Nations (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the real objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional television recruitment spots - the BBC has declared defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - instead, inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'être of military actions decided by the government.
The Americans set up a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos appear in the distributor, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fights.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army has only recently taken advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different way to recruit with shooting video games, which can be downloaded free of charge, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty cake at the Christmas party of the ministries
The Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the holiday party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to fire 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so enjoy the power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defence, but not for Ministry workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, and for the Christmas of the Missionaries the relatives of the soldiers who are currently carrying out missions abroad will be invited. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the holidays of the other portfolios
The festival of MET will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred ministry workers the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty is expected.
In the party of the wallet will reign a Christmas atmosphere, will also perform artists and there will be tombola draw.
The Christmas of the ANF cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost a million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than 400 guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party to be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without suit
The CNAJ building hosted not only the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the Lucia Day dance on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the words of the minister's greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to wear a suit or dress at night.
The health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organise a program and a party for its workers in their own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
Instead, Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year work meeting.
There are 180 guests who - as reported by the press department - will have only coffee and salty cake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai, will instead simply toast to his colleagues in the Ministry's classroom for local governments and territorial development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own hall of events with the participation of 436 workers.
The holiday party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - this budget will pay for the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, the workers of the MF all years celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the afternoon hours of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year reception on January 20, at the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple reception standing, to which will be invited only the specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech from the minister and end with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments communicated to [origo].
In the press department of the environment portfolio they were unable to report on the budget for the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than 400 people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will constitute a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the Monday strike that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stoppage will begin.
Surely this action will cause great difficulties in the transport, since the railway traffic will be stopped completely and until 1 pm the workers of the Collective Transport Company of Budapest will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike they will hold together with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
The strike commission of LIGA and the National Trade Union of Machinists will also be set up to coordinate Monday's actions.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday the participating unions will strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike begun.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, trade unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of Monday of the National Assembly it is also possible that only the public health law will be voted on at very late hours of the night, or perhaps near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, significant difficulties will have to be faced in transport: on the railways it will stop working indefinitely, in the morning part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the Volán companies may be stopped.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on minimum services, although, as Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, the Budapest Airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., a four-hour strike will be held by the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical and Thermal Energy Industry, the Education Unions called for a strike of 2 and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) which are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal regarding public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will come into effect next year.
The third is to ensure that, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions, it is possible that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect another proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased from several points of view the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the company's "risk warning" it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They affirmed that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between Gypsies and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country".
They remind us that: from autumn 2006 onwards, the reorganization of the extreme right-wing and radical groups in Hungary received increasing publicity and momentum, and that since summer 2007, numerous organizations have been formed in the country to define themselves as "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, of the army, that is of the state" - they add.
They said: all this takes place in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
For to highlight the civil aspect and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, in many neighboring States they referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighboring countries, want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard functions in the same way as for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of extreme right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the mass riots of the Gypsies that took place in one of the neighbourhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defense."
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has sparked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also the Hungarian Gypsies react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research for Political Capital, said the news agency's question: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence risk change, they inform the public, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the coming anus will be less - work days are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America parties are not uniform.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holidays, State holidays and holidays.
The festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical events.
We celebrate the New Year as well: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, a day commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th we celebrated the founding of the State, on May 1st the feast of work, November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased family and friends.
In addition, there are two-day feasts in our country: Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for the weekends so long, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
He is the minister of labor who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal rule is binding on all employers and their employees, as well as on employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory, however, for companies and service institutions which, because of their role, work uninterruptedly even during the holidays.
This year the work order can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from the 24th of December practically stops life in the country, since according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our parties will coincide with mid or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be changed around the work party so that, for four successive days, workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2nd will be a festive day.
The other change relates to the feast of October 23rd: on Saturday October 18th, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the anus that comes during the holiday of the end of the year will be able to rest, since from 24 December it will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to embitter your colleagues' lives
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing: they are all part of our Folklore" daily at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to small discomfort or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Tips.
Sorry, I forgot to let you know you were wanted from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to fix the matter, maybe he calls the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message to you (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time, the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before you proceed to embarrassing explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can embitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
You borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to get a document, an office helper or your phone and you can't find them.
Do you remember you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but by this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your pen lost at the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, 'cause they're right to be mad at you for stealing their stuff.
Do not take envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and run out of time.
You gossip about your colleagues' private lives?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's confidence when he shares with you his most intimate secrets!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and don't gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know the things about him.
You're leaving on sick leave unreasonably?
When you phone the office and say that you are sick and your head aches unbearably, you feel bad or well, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think of others doing your job, your unstoppable tasks, your work by term.
Don't screw up your buddy!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you will have to stay home, tell them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront your absence the next day.
Tarreos, giggles, phone calls
You're into your job, but you're abruptly getting rid of your colleagues' giggles?
Have you inadvertently heard a telephone conversation that would have been better not to listen to it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarareos, chants, conversations out loud (less when you do them above their head), kicking, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontents out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not delving into a project at this time (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Don't allude to the chaos eventually prevailing in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable room for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don't see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be messy, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car progresses slowly in the usual morning jam.
A strange compass sounds on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
Turn up the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
Channel mr2 plays Zagar's song Wings of Love.
National music life didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam seems totally different when you're listening to Zagar's new album.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from underground [b2]digital [b3]national gradually change the image and even though garage style rock is back in fashion, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he began his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience learned about the set that initially performed only in small clubs when the wan2 magazine selected its first album released in 2002 from among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend builder, able to be sold also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his group are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they gladly wear this label.
The set reacted as it should react: it prepared a new album and even better.
The recently released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the original years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
It is okay to refer to the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy music, now appeared - according to the spirit and tendency of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The album includes a true success of the channel mr2 Petõfi that recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought to the ears of the radios the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
For everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of a select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty attend concerts, but also the oldest.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are and how many are the people who listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good seeing more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We don't write music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the public's expectations, you lose your interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don't follow their path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, trust in each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our works with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: On mr2 hit list Petõfi Wings of Love is in first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't intend to write big hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it at the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the album and the heavier songs.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of good-voiced soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women - that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Jude Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you exactly understand the song or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted the song.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas too.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the album it seems as if the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, they sing all together and no louder than music, so the music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on stage are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
On the other hand, we did not consciously want to distribute solo roles.
The song is also about it, about us forgetting for a while our ego, who from where it has come and where it goes, so let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted others to feel the euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you dedicate more work to?
Zs.B.: In musical composition to none, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I am playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to run the groove and then, little by little everything got to its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already released the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Trade Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather like Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and certainly with good skills.
He sensed long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's responses according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, reveal is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
It was precisely in the summer that he managed to win 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity already saw her coming at the beginning of the year.
In February some news began to be heard about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't buy it and bet it right.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded €1.6 billion.
"When I already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to report it," Kerviel confesses, adding that he hasn't left anything for himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not forthcoming.
He even tricked the bosses, even though the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
The risk became a benefit
Were you afraid he'd find out?
More like, no.
"I thought I had won 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much willpower to take such a risk?
In my position, we had to work gradually.
He went to work at Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing studying in Lyon.
His annual salary was managed in the range of $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I'd never win as much as anyone else.
"In my first interview in 2005 I already noticed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a starting mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll leave you.
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew all this or that they suspected it.
"As I made money, they closed their eyes."
Only then the blow came at the beginning of this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in the middle of January he wanted to erase all traces.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost €5 billion because of it.
And how did they get a hold of him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of getting 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroner).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Out of seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion kroner will come out for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion kroner.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the newly-incorporated countries that use them least.
Twenty-year Penalty for the Former President of Nicaragua, Court Ordered
On Thursday, Nicaragua's Court of Appeals ordered the sentence of 20 years for the country's former president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 for the embezzlement of 100 billion dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
In spite of this, a while later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest on his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, he will rather depend on prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they bring him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how Alemán constantly transferred money from the government to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, in fact, to his closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund Alemán created to fund his campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how we got our budget approved.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, calmly passed the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget item, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The state budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three flaws that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as expenses of the presidents that are not only pensions but also the social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit in public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budgets.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, often issued, meaningless obligations to which they disproportionately owed their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy actions and other development networks they received from the state and from privatization.
They do not currently have this remedy.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, which ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put the state's finances in order.
Instead, however, the state continued to be in debt.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such countries as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have economyd much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why massive social programmes are not necessary, which, unfortunately, in recent years have in vain swelled with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist expenses approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform do not change then it will be the real end of any policy in this country and, govern who governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
We can say a little bit that the politicians who govern will be transformed into civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the presidents' expenses.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, had the last government not wasted in the last ten years what they could.
We would not want politicians who govern to become civil servants alone, so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and fees, the peace of mind for the preparation of other law reforms.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks Want to Solve Crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
In the Monetary Marking, more than one hundred billion dollars will be received by means of tenders.
In these tenders banks auction interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send to tender forty billion dollars, and then another twenty-four billion dollars will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting company Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to customers.
"This coordinated action by the central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what awaits them when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro's leading economist, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really wrong," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems with access to loans and will therefore have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they did not manage to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, London interbank rate that is used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," he told Reuters agency, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks helps to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Environmentalists' debates are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
"There the debates are hardly structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this topic is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "many times I only encounter the caricature of my ideas."
Stakeholders can now find out about their varying opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is academic, capable of following and judging a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent potential disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present he repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke of the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the date and thus failed to change their old driver's license, whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for change so that officials will give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without the valid licence.
According to traffic, the license hasn't changed it mainly by those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of cards, the offices of the metropolis are full of requests and the interest for the new card has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 customers a day.
The queues are waiting for half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet taken out their new licence.
The issue of a new card lasts for twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who are required to change their license and do not reach until the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid license will risk a fine starting in January.
The offender will pay a maximum of 2,000 kroner.
The police can arrange the violation with a reprimand.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine shall be SEK 2,500.
According to the above information, a fine could be given to a person who does not go anywhere.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to moderately enter fines of up to 1,000 kroner.
According to the member of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the thousand-kronor fines do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should hand over the driver's license.
Simply bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driver's license.
Persons with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplice detectives.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych are going to spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided on the final expiry of the sentence, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives in the department of Prague against organized crime were going to fall, initially, between 14 and 12.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also on trial in this case, but he is awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance in the first place.
Despite this, in other proceedings he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation in the robbery of 19 persons and the High Court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants ' allegations were rejected by the investigation on the grounds that they were fabricated.
According to the Senate of Central Bohemia, members of the police according to Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped members of the criminal group avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The charge relates to criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
In terms of theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts, but they are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without a permit for weapons.
On the house search, the police found pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser guide and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to Berdych's case are still testifying from other trials, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pđt and Maroš Šulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change a few children: 12 million
For changing some children in the Maternity House the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million kroons of compensation plus the expenses of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, disagrees in principle with Veleba's proposal.
"We do not approve such a demand, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the specialist report that the counterpart sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescissionary value.
We remain of the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for all," said Dostál.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň's family wanted, for every month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at the hospital of the faculty of Motol in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was best endured by the men although they fought with recriminations for the change of the girls.
“Women carry it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what is happening today,” Veleba said.
Veronica and Nicola were traded for nurses at the maternity home in Třebič last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The Governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered to each family at the end of October 100,000 kroner as compensation for the error committed in the Třebič hospital administered by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and they can exceptionally ask the administrator for help.
The court until today recognized them a proportionally low compensation, the amounts that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the Provincial Court of Ostrava he was the first to use the brand Reino de Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tomš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr.Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone comes the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us for about ten years.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is money.
"After years I realized that the project is successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live like parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the brand Reino de Wallachia was first used by Polívka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not a question of orienting him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later Harabiš had the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comic origin it turned out to be a profitable business and business activity from which Harabiš later created the company Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature on passports and even offered his holders discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for his own business profit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project there is Harabiš and his team who dedicated themselves completely to it.
The collaboration, between today's broken parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment there began to be conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the forever elected".
The leading role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, was played by singer Jarmila Šuláková, as mother queen.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his company, which until today has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of it.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We're in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka can present himself," added Harabiš.
Peugeot Test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
To tell you the truth, I never liked Peugeot 206 too much.
Its running features were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But his successor, Peugeot 207, now exists on the market, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little bit more advanced, and to me, all I have to do is think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the head space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I pass through the interior quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the invention of design even though the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained of short seats and backrests.
Also unlike model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And the space, and here you can feel how the measurements of the body have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned shortage of space in the header disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is his trunk.
This one I must value as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear gate) and a well distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that represent an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison to the vehicle of the same type best sold in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot lags behind with its 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child's stroller its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the flat that is quite flat after cutting down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 who despised the family's five doors.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the škoda then it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with 1400 injection ignition for 329,900 crowns, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we'd still have airbags on the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 kroner.
It's a lot, but count on the team's complements in the Fabia and it will reach a fairly similar number.
Now it is only left to decide which of the two marks.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
English schools are attended by children from Eastern European countries and therefore locals fear further changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans so far brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between migrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak migrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bronches among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said that the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls teased him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began to spit at us.
When I told him to leave, he made us the gesture of throwing apples and pears at us, and then he pulled his pants down and showed us his ass," he described another nasty incident for The Times, the Slovak student's mother.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with migrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools is beginning to be quite tense.
In Britain there are registered 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, provided you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the whole covered with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island does it find even more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the Spanish era, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place that human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of loading for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He was ordered to build one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the United States (and therefore forbidden) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings emerged in Havana, along wide avenues running the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita abánense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those already cult cars of the 1950s, until today they continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rusted between these humid and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating markedly, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments around it as there.
Other places are transformed into beauty, for example, Trinity.
Because tourism brings so much needed money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugarcane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow channels in steam or electric machines.
Their garages for tens of years were not discovered and are now there, machines that work and whose sister models in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And for that reason, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that there is a museum in Hemingway's hacienda that for those who are lovers of the writer, they should not stop visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing in limestone lands.
Mogotes, limestone pylons and rocks of high steep in the falls of the valley, and in its caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rock formations that hide dense vegetation are formed.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
By visiting one of the cigar factories in Havana you can find your final product.
Someone might find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was shot there.
Trinidad
City of old abolengo that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by French settlers who arrived later, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountains of Escambray, is such a remote place that still in the 50s of the last century there was no road that united it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, because each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as the Playa de Ancon or the valley of the sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which encourages with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small city in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that view is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, could fill many pages of all this.
However, as they say, you'd better see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, say Americans
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment are influencing the march of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defense Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working out as thought, the representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week, through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to become more active, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable, but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development on their own," Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to data from the American army is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew by 27 percent compared to last year, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, one quarter of whom are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of unit organization and equipment.
They exactly ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I am not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries in attendance in recent months there is a controversy as to whether all allies do their utmost in Afghanistan.
For liabilities it was criticized, for example, Germany.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist Sun newspaper called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan rebels discover that the Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach trillion in 2009
For each Czech the State owes 84,000 kroner.
The total debt amounted in September to 842,700 million kroner.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kroner.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic's state debt grew at the end of September to 842,700 million kroner.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
Since June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
Thus today, the Ministry of the Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the state of early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 kroner.
Over the past year, the State owed more than 111 million kroner.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year we could pass the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 900 billion and the billion kroner" said to the server iHNed.cz, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, Next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora also sees it: "We could spend the billion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political scene were seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don't see such a change," he added.
Doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
State debt is paid through treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The foreign debt for the time being has grown from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion zronor since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarter created by 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the strategy of payments and debt management of the state for the year 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend 159,200 million kroner.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroner due to improved state budget developments.
The amount is mainly made up of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million kroner instead of the planned 91.3 billion kroner.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about Kr 13,3 billion, the reserve of Kr 10 billion for the payment of pensions, Kr 43 billion for the financing of the state's obligations and Kr 1,8 billion in payments of the European Investment Bank's loans.
I was comparing Khartoum in front of a court today to give a name to a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan to insult Islam has been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British was accused of having let pupils aged 6 to 7 give the name of Mahomet to a stuffed bear when all representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was suffering from a pain of lashes.
This 54-year-old British school teacher based at the Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan has been arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with an attack on Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back in fact to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the bear photo with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear he - himself bore no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting towards a religious faith, "I'm sorry only that he asked the children to vote for a name ", it's just an "innocent mistake" according to him.
Opinion divided by many pupils of the school teacher who describe her as " very attentive to her pupils " and " never speaks of religion in class " .
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the most commonly given middle name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have ended on Wednesday morning to Baden, in Austria, a sixth and final discussion session without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status ", said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period ", he added, noting that " obvious tensions exist " .
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, regrouping the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated by 90% Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council, by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was charged with a new mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, the Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his regrets.
But he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
" For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible. "
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a right of veto.
" The Parliament of Kosovo shall have the last word "
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia ", had declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must be completed as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be " in concert " with the Westerners.
Bush Begins Agreement Between Israelis and Palestinians · Global Voices
President George Bush announced, during the opening of his own international peace conference to Annapolis in Maryland on Tuesday, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in view of finding a definitive regulation of the 60-year-old disputed point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must stop its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides' obligations regarding the path to peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main pitfalls of the disputed Israeli-Palestinian point: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and deepened" and refer in all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things."
Going up to his return in the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what the upcoming negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set at the end of 2008 the end of the implementation of his co-existing Palestinian and Israeli " vision of two States " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made an effort in this direction on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects ", says Prince Saoud in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just as every time in these kinds of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17:00, Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but on patrol, and I was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating lighthouse," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorized to run on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " to all gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the transfer to the right," the police said.
The alcohol control carried out on the occupants of the vehicle was shown to be negative.
The state of the car (the outcast front, cracked windshield, bumper starts) attests to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " acts of manslaughter and denial of help " to the IGPN, co-opted with the departmental public security directorate of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor states that the IGPN investigation, at this stadium, dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on its left. "
Yesterday, a type of groove, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the shoes on the floor, showed that both vehicles had been locked in time for the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be the subject of a technical survey.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated by Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen would have left the site very quickly, not thus providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious misconduct " at this point.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more research, about which we need to be very cautious ", a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness to these moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that looks precisely at the scene.
"We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to revive them, says this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw " a completely unsavory cop, limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the room was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that the people present of the unexpected situation of the youth, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
According to this witness, the reliefs arrived "about twenty minutes after the police march."
They also performed heart massages, in vain.
" I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not bring assistance to the youth.
These young people have been helped.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," stressed the prosecutor.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore in the east of the country, nearly 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where cops loaded and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, resulting in a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president "encouraged the population to send flowers to the judges who pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and the waste to those who took oath in front of Musharraf ".
" Musharraf's promise no longer fulfills "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly concerned with the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to rule in the next few days on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf to the presidential elections on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
" Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the judgments of the Supreme Court ", the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf ' s promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president " no longer values " after the establishment of the state of emergency, Tariq Azeem told the Assistant Minister of Information on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Information Minister also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of armies.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unanticipated
This estimate takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as ill-planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one pregnancy in three (36%) is not foreseen, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This estimate takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as ill-planned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for better "fertility control", according to the institute that notes that the pill utilization rate among women aged 20 to 44 is increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated about a month for a couple in five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of work in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew members at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "fallen" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday then that the astronauts had released from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a cylindrical thick piece that was soon to host the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see frame).
This module is a type of landing platform for laboratory modules.
But we must be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a module of electricity production with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After having moved it, the crew began the reorganization of the module solar panels that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, has been damaged in about a metre by a wire that jammed.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snailing at the end of the 30 meters length of the teledirected arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalker in Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician has been in charge of "operation" the solar panel "injured".
After inspecting precisely the damage, he severed the fallible cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been assisted by the second " spacewalker " that had remained near the airlock and, inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey cane wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "fallen" by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a midday break before today, seven astronauts returned from the Discovery shuttle for the planned return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently clearly down to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros to the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operational outcome for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport plane, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the mother house of the European builder EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without any more encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the EADS operational result failed at 86% in 2006, mainly because of burdens linked to delays in another programme, that of the very heavy carrier A380.
Initially, the group anticipated a first handover of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the ballot box: the Russians are going to opt massively for the party of President Poutine, united Russia.
Confirming his aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message about public channels, which are already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with handing over a new charge against the West accused of interference - his topic of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and open elections, elections without incident ", he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign marred by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there is "never had such dirty elections, even in the time of Eltsin."
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, former world champion of check Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Poutine to the presidency?
The official newspaper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that elected the government and the president?
Whatever it is, at the legislative as well as the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel they own their destiny ", says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Historian Nikolaï Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine re-established the model of a paternalistic State, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic release ", says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " willingly renounce the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly given evidence after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What's the point of reflecting?"
The phenomenon touches all social strata, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: " Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far accessible only in a "humanitarian" end, that is, individually and nominated, at the request of an old victim or his successors.
The eleven states responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to search engines and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow searches "particularly on the displacements of prisoners, the camp population and the state of health of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, opposed the opening of these nominative documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deportees or those subjected to compulsory labour and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India's first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
Last April the European Union's Foreign Ministers had given their approval to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade now reached about EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trade partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free trade pact will dople both economies a great deal " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans ", justified Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants change annually to "€47 billion of goods" and to "€10 billion of services", declared this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential." L'European Union and India are on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering £10 billion in five weeks
The bank of England on Thursday was concerned to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion to the base index of 5.75 percent in five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
" To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight by the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , states in a statement.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on December 6 at 12h 15 GMT, the base index and until January 10.
This is the first time it seems that the Bank England BoE puts liquids on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that " it is prepared to take other measures to keep the interbank lending indexes " up-to-date in line with its base index.
The daily interbank index was 5.829 % on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6,6 %, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the change in the pound relative to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny examination of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the proposal for a socialist law on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (meeting for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the increase of 50% of the bonus for employment, the re-establishment of the floating TIPP (internal rate per oil products), a check-transport or restrictions on rents.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the examination of the articles (180 voices against 115), the session has been adjourned at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition to some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn's Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more or less, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the lead of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival at the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organization of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as " the most inspiring event " she has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that her company and Melvin Benn's work parallels to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with perseverance with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we stagnate in low-level policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones pursues.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that, lately, will take place in Philadelphia. "
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after being unmarked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M$ and $11.3M$ in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
" Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours are rather in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both a country festival impression to the European and urban way in the American way. "
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but affirms " that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life. "
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", as an example of that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been launched to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will have the flavor of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His colleagues from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal Faces Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood movie dishes into Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This mission of seduction is part of the function of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governator?
"Be cautious, it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If he finds that conditions in Montreal are favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that will judge the best," he says.
The race to festivals
For the time being, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskars is started.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them courage and make sure the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Age had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the board for Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors already rub their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from the statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term".
Although they are not in favour of having the stock market pick up wagons in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, ready to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect of flight towards quality values both in long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, head of sales of BIS in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
"The thing is not for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since the peaks marked on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year by close to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at this time.
However, the expert notes that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, values that we are close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the United States regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be in charge of bringing the Ibex to new heights.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it is up to great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Inversis Bank assures that the increases will come from the banks and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, if any.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow their path," explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a bass month.
The real end-of-year rally was held in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded an upturn of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 hours to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular's experience will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that supports the schedules of the shops.
This is precisely the objective that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture the private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, self-employed and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, says that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although a greater hiring of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per local to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, that even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises of PopularMax will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff to the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We've made it.'
With that phrase he expressed yesterday his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the close of the market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: 'It is what hurts me, it is not because we have grown more but because we have gone down less', he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That profit puts its loss at 15.66% what we've been doing for the year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and invested by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, who yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (Five Day Publisher) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we rent it in terms of audience'.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television network to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
If this announced data became real, the television station would record this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antena 3's net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million) while net television revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution in Bolsa de Telecinco is the high pay out that has maintained so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría shared 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile claims that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to leave our shareholders happy, to which we have already given value with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing a certain fatigue at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It is due, they explain, to the fact that it has cut projected income growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena's profit forecast of 3.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecuritys: recommends buying both securities based mainly on their high profitability per dividend and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: better sees Telecinco (accumulate) than Antena 3 (maintain) for the 'attractive multiples' and rise of the business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends underweight in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).

In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will be developed by the new law, with the aim that both will enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activities of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and encouraging cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial advisory services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial service firms (FSS), financial advisory companies (FIAs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with existing stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they perform, in order to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Economics Commission, several modifications were incorporated, among which it emphasizes that securitized debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of US high risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the directive was transposed to legally define the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can perform 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of the royal decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work as an employee, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting clients to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonised CPI increases by five tenths in November, to 4.1 per cent
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the one used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advance indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and minister of economy, Pedro Solbes, has said that the increase of 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has augurs that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of the Congress that "even if the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with the monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He has also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4%", acknowledged the Minister of Economy regarding the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock €42 billion in three years
The deposits of Northern Rock have fallen more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time, it had accumulated record deposits of over 25 billion pounds, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months because of the distrust of its clients and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of that money offered by the Government and which will continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with its Virgin Money financial brand, needs to capture about a quarter of the revenue in British banks that will be deposited over the next three years to achieve the remaining £18 billion to reach the target of £30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for his eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as its preferred to rescue it from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) earlier this morning for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the council and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, the current popular deputy, and until then the municipal councillor, who according to sources of the research consulted by Cadena SER, could be the 'leader' of this plot.
The officers continue to search the municipal units and the Department of Urban Planning and no further arrests are ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As reported yesterday by Cadena SER, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore avowed, was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to head PSOE's candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
Former defense minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the president of the government and secretary general of the socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of Congress in the event that the socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE Secretary of Organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that he held this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "it does seem" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, who made public on 15 November his decision not to run for the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to devote himself to combating climate change at university level.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has kept insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he has pointed out that, like citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or cry" and make it "more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk calmly and calmly is Congress, the president of the government was once interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good doing" and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his post so as not to fall into what, he said, his adversaries could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to merciless persecution by both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement that is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach obliges him to explain why his government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leading role in the EU's non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the breach, in which sectors it has occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires him to explain to the Spanish with the utmost clarity what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to make, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been, nor will there be, such explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to account businesses and individuals.
Even the cent of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he has hastened to deny it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is merely a virtual contracting party and does not pretend to move by bicycle or cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the chief of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hostel businessman for possible urban crimes, have reported sources of the investigation today.
The edil was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose offices he is currently with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Council of Urbanism and the municipal company for the management of the Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable so that the Galician company Nuaria would build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the case file, which is heard by Court No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have been brought before the courts today.
According to sources, the former Totana councillor and now the PP's autonomous parliament, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been imputed, as has the current bride of the former governor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes were allegedly carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crime Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Guardia Civil, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would mean doubling the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the car parks of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by the way, head of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the very day on which the criticism of Blackburn's book appeared, curiously:
"The content of the symbol of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and said that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in institutes".

A colleague passes information on the introduction of Internet download offences into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal from the store discs worth less than 400 euros, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros from the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than that imposed on unloading (art. 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than the one for unloading (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Taking part in a tumultuous quarrel has a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without authorization of the authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone is losing their hand, a very long hand.

My family doctor took one of his articles on rare research titled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depend on what the comrades gain.
The study has been conducted using tomographic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if when both were right they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecution office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on that list from which the documentary by Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not released in Spain) takes its title, which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the criminals who have fled and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What kind of insurance do I have?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the card, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of it, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This undertaking is embodied in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed upon in exchange for liability for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of an accident.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the card, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the more likely they are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
It is for this reason that both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower accident rate due to their prudence.
Also, drawing on the accounts, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of mishap.
By increasing the frequency, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well in order to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 find it difficult to hire insurance at an affordable price, such as the low driving experience and seniority of the card.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is insurance at all risks, there are other more economical options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a free-of-charge risk, so that they get insurance coverage at all risks but at a more feasible price.
Such an agreement would require the customer to pay part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer contributes will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", specifies Luis Noguera, the highest responsible in Spain of First Europa, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A word of advice.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be careful and avoid casualties as much as possible, as this will impact on the bonus, being able to reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base fee.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
After the 25-year-olds, drivers have it easier to hire insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended thing is to hire a whole risk with franchise.
"Young people are usually unable to make use of the experience they have previously acquired when using an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children it is preferable that he negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as his financial situation allows him, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with a franchise (this could be 300 euros), or, where a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchise," Luis Noguera says.
For retirees it is advisable to have insurance at all risk with a franchise (with this being 150 euros), or one to third parties extended when you have a high level of bonus.
It has to be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
Celtic seeks in Milan a point worth the eighths
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the league of the 'Champions', since the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified in the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that receives the Benfica, who has four, does not advance him.
These two Group D games will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in semifinals in search of a place for the end of the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing in eighths.
Gordon Strachan's set could even serve a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar does not win, but it cannot be trusted because at nine point equals the pass is for Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to embitter the night to the Scots, who trust to enter eighths for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round the last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the one-way.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the triumph, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get into eighths and to stay in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, before some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "bright".
Around 20,000 people ran out of tickets to witness the concert, which included a video telling the story of the group that raged at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that captures its main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five Spice Girls came on stage wearing bracelets given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the crowds that crowded the GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had forbidden him days earlier.
In the run-up to the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star "has not seen our wardrobe at all, so I'm nervous about what you're going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other very much".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last performed together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
Between the five, there are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), in San Jose (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
In Madrid they will perform on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia's export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopolistic owner of gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine was supposed to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge Ukraine more, as it has pledged to pay 50% extra in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not be linked to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which rapidly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "Should Test Foreign Workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal records of employees outside Europe, a vigilante said.
Auditor General Robert Black's recommendation came after it was found that a foreign doctor was involved in the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the amount of foreign personnel it has.
However, his report pointed out other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor general checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area, following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused in connection with the alleged car bombings in the United Kingdom.
NHS expects to conduct pre-employment checks on candidates to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although Scotland's health board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal record checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The auditor-general's report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign personnel."
The president of BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because the boards have problems identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being extensively complied with.
This includes passport checks, work permit checks and qualifications checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the pre-employment policy and guide for foreigners in the NHS.
The secretary of health, Nicola Sturgeon, states: "I was very interested in this work being carried out following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates in film awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division's late vocalist, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophies were also given to star Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, to director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress by thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were given at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control continues Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - featuring soundtracks by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only £3,000.
But the winner was also the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of the album Joshua Tree of U2, awarded two awards- for best director and best debutante director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor Award was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a head of the Russian mafia in London, in David Cronenberg's film Promesas del Este.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris award for his contribution to British cinema.
The five-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones' sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, he's really an honor."
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants formed by foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world's largest oil plant, following a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert," who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Twenty-two other detainees were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda militants in fighting allied forces and supporting the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heretic by the more extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants—recruited by calls from Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the country's pro-occidental government—had as their targets residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, since five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 others accused of providing support and financial support to militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, they declared scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago."
Police seize "uranium enriched"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare to be enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, where ordinary voters record questions on video and send them for dissemination to candidates.
None of the questions put on the afternoon of Wednesday, November 28 were more ridiculous than the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican party on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party in view of next year's elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates for candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest debate on a single issue, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to raise the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the emitters noticed peaks of approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest word exchanges of the night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation as he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and give them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
None have the word to be nominated, but both remain in the race perhaps because both alerted on the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance towards illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of China’s toxic toys and other external concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first of all in Iowa's most recent poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, coinciding with Liberal Ron Paul's fundraising campaigns, and his heated statements from Wednesday's debate.
The two have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labor pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it still emerges.
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, nor are these exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor sucked off extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour ruling party of over £650,000 (US$1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided calling an election, foolishly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, as Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated the regulatory weakness and poverty of judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative corruption.
A trio of retired generals began a mutiny in the House of Lords, protesting against the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the labor secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably on his way out.
Governments can reach a turning point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes over.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister can't improve things, that it doesn't take much longer, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press seek bad news; and the government gets defensive and doesn't focus.
In one part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that it is new.
Although he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to Brown's decisions as chancellor of the treasury.
And even though it's not directly involved in Blairish's setbacks - or "partner cash," researching the funding of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor been conned directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for big political taxpayers are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that he was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraiser who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these proceedings, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but he dilutes in decision-making over a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - largely led by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Public Life Standards Commission, because he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for genuine reform of party funding.
This will require hard labor co-operative work with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the trade unions—close measures for a partisan like Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural for dorsal fins to swim excitedly around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis subprime spreads other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days late, respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million in its American consumer finance business, partly due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Lateness and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter's crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American bankruptcy law (2005) resulted in a sharp fall in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a huge loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore late payments) would be growing again, or conditions for borrowers may have worsened.
Industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exists: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than at active securities, so falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrower lending capacity.
They can even work to overtake the emitters.
Incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decrease if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the credit card debt goes up on the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions for mortgage lenders, by changing interest rates or by altering credit balances.
That should, in theory, reduce the risk of rapid asset retention.
"We're not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, head of finance at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit crunch push America into recession, industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
Keep watching those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for the frauds with Enron's former head of financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. District, each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a well-known case in Britain for the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the weak end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were of having alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's fall.
The accusation against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, which helped his spiral of bankruptcy fall.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interest at zero, but the three British knew it would be on the rise.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest at $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest on the company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million were left in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers collected 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted on two counts of conspiracy at Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that they required to live in the United States while the trial was taking place.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses look successful.
The collapse resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension schemes.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay, and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were commissioned in the past years for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of over 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it is for private family flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract the new wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany crafted yachts to the 50-cent diamond-encrusted car grills.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche at his neighbor stand."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and broth compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
"We lived the same thing in 1890, when wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think-thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccablely prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in evening suits, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," Yumatova said, reeled off the design suit he wore as a veteran carpet network dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum pen cutters, Mövenpick ice creams, tables for swimming pools on request, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr.Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand of Delft Royal Dutch Porcelains, in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
In fact, the sellers said that the wealthiest Russians with the most track record (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from eye-catching logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, CEO of King Koil Beds, said he sold two $70,000 each mattress systems, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grilles, for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with inlaid rays of Swarovski colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, will not necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr.Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian Millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it isn't in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone booths (British style) filled with stacks of $1 million counterfeit bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karryev says.
Shampoo surgery could cause death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A little healthier" and watched an ambulance climb up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a car from the police patrol showed up.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the ambulance come up," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the home of 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities still don't determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicology test, although the results won't be available until a few weeks. This will help solve the mysterious death she has in the upper ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, who left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the County Union prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said the house arrived around 3 P.M.
On November 21st, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have said little about his investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a withered rosebush is located at the front of the house, and a dálmata barks at the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainylline ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was located at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the NYPD department, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
"She would say, "You have to watch with this or that," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's embarrassing."
Federal reserve is expected to cut rates to lift the stock market
The shares jumped to both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm down credit conditions with interest rates cuts, which were increased with reassuring comments from the vice president of the US central bank.
The stock exchanges were loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continuing tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was "in part reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October."
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
Observations also helped to calm Wall Street amid bad news for the US economy, such as house sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at the close of 13,289.40, while the large S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at the close to 6.306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of Britain's top companies.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
In the past, the re-emergence of the stress of credit in the markets was highlighted after a strong demand at a three-month fund auction of the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the actions of the federal reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained the credit and the three-month lending rates "Libor" among the British banks, meant the biggest increase since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England takes the lawsuits of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara with trial
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England at Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection that is on loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because Hugh Morris' desk, director of England, is beginning to fill in offers to become a national selector, and if not, a part time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than capacity.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult, because it requires judgments that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the chance to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so do they have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to grasp the captain's eye at the same time as taking a "wicket" and a batter to get chances to change the order if he wants to impact as a player someday.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for "fit and bowls" as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 top-class wickets in 33 runs each to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of these.
The games of Shah or Bopara in the Asgiriya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each race and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became a major player, and despite scoring a hundred times double against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion at today's Asgiriya Stadium session, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greater experience of young Bopara's exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah's favor is his brilliant and valuable early 88's debut test in Bombay, 32 hundred first class versus only 6 Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent record against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two turns in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, seemed to have taken from his "beating" something of élan that in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team has the joy of living in swords.
He gets on for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he flipped his vehicle into an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was to pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked away, to tell him with excitement, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, including his slippery pass to have effects on his moves that seem to satisfy him, batting with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles who ran out of cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni physician.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and which is safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shi'ite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to cease for a moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime did not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped get Al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been led from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after which he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my comrades."
"That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were drawn to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops consolidated groups of "concerned citizens," armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many claimed to have returned because of the denial of visas and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shi'ite Prime Minister, called on the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian gangs of death.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them back to Iraq," said the Sunni.
"I can't believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shia areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will re-emerge sectarian tensions and begin the struggle.
Little Saar, good manners.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sarland people lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftyth time to a non-Sardish man who we are not French" - that was the ironic bike about themselves of the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Saarland education system which in a study by the German Institute of Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" held fifth place.
In this way, colleges by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students from Saarland is higher than the average in higher schools, many of whom do not have a bacillerato.
"The Saarland takes advantage of the system of vocational education," says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than every five young people do their baccalaureate at the Professional School. So, it turns out that Saarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for vocational and academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, relative to the population number, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences dropped by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced higher schools to advertise more for engineering science specialties.
"After PISA's first study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model imitates the other federal states as well.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of backward pupils in school development fell from 29 to 20 per cent.
But in general, the Saar did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, even if they could achieve good results in this area.
Although the Sarlandians were not French, the language of the neighbours was a compulsory subject in secondary schools.
Chávez changes the time.
There will soon be another time zone different from the rest of the world in Venezuela.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez let the schedule change in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Chávez is currently becoming a comedian in Spain.
As the Venezuelan State Official Gazette has reported, according to the new law, the time will pass to less than four GMT hours.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would in his day impose the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would have no relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative Álvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
This reform could greatly expand its power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas concerning the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chávez said he was critical that Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also much talk about Chávez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes a feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was annoyed by the continued interruptions by the left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decline in the real wage threatens German employees despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real salary account in 2007 than the previous year.
"The fault for that is the weak wage evolution, the increase in value added tax and the spread of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research told the newspaper "Bild" of economic cycles.
New charges for unemployment insurance may also be borne by employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% by passing from year to year is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the labour office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for loans and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, prices are rising by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, something that had not been raised until now. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, researchers had suspected that lightning could exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays are silent at a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles tells the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have provoked reactions in the ocean that, on the other hand, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it is not like that: if there was ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface temperatures of 500°C reign, oscillating in such a way that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Possibly, Venus is a "diabolic" twin from Earth, but it is still a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the mission "Venus Express" is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth because of its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there had been no special missions since the 1990s, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to the opinion of the researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more characteristics common to Earth than we had supposed," reports ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by the fastest spinning clouds.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high atmospheric terrestrial layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost so large.
This planet also called dawn star or evening star orbiting the Sun nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its 92 bar atmospheric pressure does not resemble the Earth much, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets water had been agglomerated that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it was dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties over the reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the September rally.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, cares about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the grand coalition end that fight for Dalai Lama's reception.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Democratic Christian Union) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received in carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly expressed his disgust at the reception of Dalai Lama and because of this he was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the religious leader of Tibetans in their official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move into the streets.
They made barricades, the vandals shot the police with rifles: after serious riots involving young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Partido de la Unión Democratracristiana) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We must also look at the fact that the social problems of our country do not take the violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all young people are engaged in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states, and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
That refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits."
It's still early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The youth engaged in serious riots on the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolouse.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany, demanded greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, the proceedings are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age is above the average.
It is necessary to ensure that there are more vocational training posts.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
It is necessary to "provide young people with the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training more quickly".
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel went peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses flew over the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take rigorous measures until necessary.
Around 80 policemen were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel on Monday-Tuesday night.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the youth was not the fault of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The action far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that nothing more must be expected of it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate action, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As to the reproach that was made for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that this would be a provincial way and thus he showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House it was very clearly stated to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
There could be no slightest interest or feeling in the country ' s problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
An example: the prevention of climate change: it praised itself greatly for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but it says nothing about how these climate goals should be realized here.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years the head of the Party of the Democratic Christian Union has not been able to afford so much modesty.
Well, he insists on expressions to get a boost to people.
And in this way it damages their public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke inner problems are appearances of little value.
Children's poverty and concerns for low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about that subject using subordinate sentences.
It's amazing how many times you're wrong to talk when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it came to more concrete information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of YouTube Republican presidential pre-candidates and now must fear only one candidate from the outside.
Tensions between candidates have already been noticed from the outset.
Mitt Romney reproached his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into "a haven for illegal immigrants."
He, for his part, responded with serious reproach: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani replies to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as the Republican group so far has no clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were sent to Youtube, also have not much content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," that was John McCain's reproach on his opponent Ron Paul, the only one in the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives a lot of criticism from Vietnam war veterans, when he refuses to recognize "Waterboarding" as torture, a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown, they simulate his death.
The reactions of the audience in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised the conservation values and denied the rise in taxes.
So you can see better where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At that time I was wrong," Romney explains, "and apologizes to the people and the television audience for having been an advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president made himself sworn in as president.
This is how the eight years of military rule in Pakistan end.
On Thursday Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, took oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidante Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he took power with an incruent military coup, the former general rules the state for the first time as a civilian chief.
With his resignation from the post of head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main status of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state's attorney general, after the Musharraf oath will soon annul the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court there were many pro-Musharraf jurists. Last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watirist region, five soldiers were killed and four others injured.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the Afghan border.
Krautrock's founders are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continues its activity: three members of "Harmony" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a rerun, a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written at the band's best time.
In those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has before him his little box, his wires and especially his buttons.
In the middle is sit Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with his sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's fans was the fact that the band Harmonia made music again.
What needs to be rebelled here is the following: the precise questions have shown that the band's name resounded in people's minds, but it wasn't something so special that after 32 years the public would miss her so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the seventies?
Especially because the equivocal Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to the members of the band Can 2003 in Cologne for their life work, in the room you could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths with amazement.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times I did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
A while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and they had a name, Cluster, which promised great fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at the time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, they say, an Ottenstein Harmonia song association banner appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on esoteric themes and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and since that time has been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to thank Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set itself as a goal to cultivate this German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius's work, the band Neu! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade, is also present there.
In this way, all of Krautrock's influences to the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, to it belongs the future".
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in the black and white photo projections, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and the battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects apparatus they had built with their own hands.
Electronic music is now as it had to be.
Three people who dig deeper into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere she coughs, whispers and at a good time of emphasis she sings "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock was already a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia remains calm.
On the stage we think very well about what is already evident.
Where does it start and where does it end?
That can break one's nerves or give away a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to war in the Balkans.
But the two of them weren't very convinced.
Either the concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkan mountain, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
Finally we had lost sight of the handsomest man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in women's films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument for perhaps watching the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles today have to be so long and crazy?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the eye: deep down, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decadence so far retained most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Morederischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Morederischer Frieden" can be narrated in a nutshell: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads to her falling in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we welcome the fact that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another script author (Richard Shepard on two counts), the story about American reporters in the war going to detect a war criminal Serb called "bitch," could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now."
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and every time it turns out to be a trip in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first we are introduced to Simon Hunt, whom they do not let be simply a cynical with heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Muslim Bosniac who are going to kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters of the world could not accomplish for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to avenge them fairly.
It's so bad, they make you want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against kinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in reality, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and stresses that the Americans and the French are not really concerned to pursue them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show that it's hard to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blooding Diamantes" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It has to be at least decades before Hollywood makes a good movie about the Holocaust, taking as an example the film "The List of Schindler".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the Vietnam War plays "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because scriptwriters don't have the slightest qualm (which is necessary to be able to) in narrating good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" turned out so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look at an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied, "That's only because some things never change."
Big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives negative criticism of the Olympic Games in response.
The mayor of Hamburg received a lot of criticism of politics and economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that we must be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday this resignation as "not good for the economic location".
In the last time no other project in the big city promoted as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, the political, sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympic Games would not take place until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but is decided by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's application for the Winter Olympics in 2028.
"This preference means to us that in this period of time, which we thought we would have until 2028, from the realistic point of view we will have no chance."
“Despite everything, this dream did not end forever,” von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity go away, if at this point the plans are ruined," said Wednesday Günter Ploß, HSB's director.
A waiver of the request contradicts the statement of the head of the Senate made at a reception at the general meeting of the German Public Sports Federation of higher schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for 2015 Universities not as a "substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sports Federation of High Schools named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgersschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate for not taking such valuable time to build houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed the development of the small district of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated Olympic planning for the small Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever links the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow weighing on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" gloss-boxes on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" cast doubt on the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm carried out internal research and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén museum gave to the Moderna Museet Museum, are false, and almost a hundred others of "Stockholm type", which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brick-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that had "Brick" soap dust cartons.
According to Warhol, in the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Museum Moderna Musseet were exhibited hundreds of Bright-boxes of cardboard. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillis".
These were not works of art, but copies (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed the production in Sweden of wooden Shine-boxes, but they were not exhibited in the Museum Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Stockhol-type" "Brick-Boxes" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost one hundred wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Museum Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First, their tight silvers were printed and embossed and then painted in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silvers. Moreover, it is not about oil painting, but rather about acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official Shine-Box list," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Moderna Museet Museum, adding that if the New York Authentication Commission "Andy Warhol Art" will not reach any conclusion, the Moderna Museet Museum will classify these six boxes as the copies/objects of exhibition."
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in which these are soap dust boxes.
But from that moment there everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
The ringleader Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been barricaded in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had a Thursday trial for having attempted a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so he could suddenly deposit with some 30 sympathizers.
Evidently the military police officers who were to watch him had passed into their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security adviser, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
"People are fed up," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to move into our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who formerly led the elite Scout Reangers troops, said that the other military troops wanted to follow the march shortly.
Big government critics called a big demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months his government has been reproached for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be Versatel's largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the telecommunication company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for a share is 14, 46 euros.
You have only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There were many speculations about the absorption of the company.
There are also options to further increase the financial share at Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entering the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its share of the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution maintains the equity securities for a third party.
United Internet already in the day before had participated with almost 10 percent to the telecommunication company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the measure of capital increase placed 17,4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106,4 million euros.
The United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros from them.
In addition, the companies started negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperations.
"We strengthen our collaboration," the United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies founded a company together MSP, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday the United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent share of Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, they involve 18.49 percent of Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all options, especially the participation of the public limited liability company Freenet.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
By the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of the share in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch will achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
