Incidence accumulated in rapid increase of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparedness for a wave of patients with COVID-19 who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent was a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2.
Since then, disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, i.e. an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and that the majority recovers.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compared them with those of the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK countries with that of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, the COVID-19 continued to spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world now follow that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were recorded in France on 24 January 2020, in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA and UK (UK) countries, with 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date inclusive, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative amount and cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the reported COVID-19 case counts in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of 14-day truncated COVID-19 cases; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day truncated COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries generally followed that of Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased considerably around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries exhibited similar upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK countries, compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8:00 a.m., another 15 EU/EEA and UK countries had already recorded a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is the case despite different stages in countries, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different country case definitions and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data are not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to supplement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios in relation to saturation of medical care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a >90 % overcapacity risk of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since clusters of cases have so far been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional target population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as that taking place in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if it is not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the deaths of 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere around the world, causing a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will address the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unheard-of and indelible memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country and to nearly 50 more countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3000 patients deceased.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize progress in research on this rapidly developing new subject.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some crucial questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have met twice with highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused an outbreak in China in 2003, and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third per coronavirus recorded in human history.
As shown in fig. fig. 1.1, pneumonia conglomerates of unknown origin were first reported on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transports suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the source of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and nearly 50 more countries around the world (fig. (fig. 2).2).
Since the situation is evolving rapidly, the final size and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people between 30 and 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected people were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20, and only 14 people were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men more (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 expanded into conglomerates mostly in and around Hubei.
On average, 5 days (from 2 to 9) elapsed between the onset and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2 days).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, wrapped viruses that contain a single-sensing chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses are those that infect humans.
The ear glycoprotein (S) of the shell binds to its cell receptors, the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with the envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motive.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the electronic cryomicroscopy structure of the complete length human ACE2 in resolution 2.9 Å, in complex with the B0AT1 transporter amino acid.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats and were transmitted to humans by civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bat was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96 % identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and the route of transmission remains to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of bat viruses to humans, which implied homologous recombination within protein S.
According to one study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins (long snout mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference propagated by the totality of two genomes remains a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective at deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
So far, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Therefore, we can only use previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4).4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophagic phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response adds to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
Cooperating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, coronaviruses may inhibit T-cell functions by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by emergence in conglomerates, most likely affects elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt effective quarantine time to the most accurate incubation period; this way, asymptomatic infected people will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally be quarantined for 14 days.
The quarantine should be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or by other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnoea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory care, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the higher lethality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with SRM.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100 %), dry cough (29%-75 %), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25 %) and sore throat (13%-25 %) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory care was needed in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For the SRM, according to a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high and rose to 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 95 % from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, like a cruiser.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital may re-enter the virus, an alarm signal that quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at an early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocytic sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer level, a product of the degradation of fibrin in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities are detected in the chest X-rays of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadows or opacity in bilateral grinding glass in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (APRS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid build-up, and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst findings on chest X-rays are often in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of a hyaline membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes into the interstice, and multinucleated syncycial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which coincides with the pathology of a viral infection and SDRA, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MRS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of a history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre sample) using a graduated rod in less than an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if checked in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can mostly provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These therapies include treatments currently in use or potential with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as those of the digestive system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
As a result, respiratory assistance is critical for alleviating symptoms and saving lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storm is known to be the result of an exaggerated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MRS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release an enormous amount of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antireceptor antibody of IL6, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF block; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; a cytokine signaling pathway 4 suppressor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, the prudent use of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses for a short period of time has been recommended for patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the date of this analysis, the efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19 has been demonstrated.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other viruses with monocatenary RNA, such as MRS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct a couple of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
Interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
The removal of blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting the disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was removed from the blood from a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and 10 severely ill patients were injected.
His symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and better oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, this needs to be verified and clarified to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, possibly leading to fatal toxicity.
The level of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to MCT theories.
Most effective components remain unknown or imprecise, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used MCT in only about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (MO) treatment with the combined treatment of MO and MCT alone.
They discovered that the time needed to recover body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly shorter in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
More strikingly, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% vs 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% vs 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of MCT are still waiting for more well-controlled trials on larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and to determine the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 are generally very afraid of highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbiditys were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
The tracking of mandatory contacts and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, can make people more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons with suspicion and persons in contact with them, as well as to the general public who needs it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the transmission chain of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein S-based vaccines to generate potent, long-lasting neutralising antibodies or immunity to protect against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated virus vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older people and models of lethal stimulation and their protection against infection by viruses of zoonotic origin still need to be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is probably due to SARS being extinguished 17 years ago and no new cases have been recorded since then.
On the other hand, there are still sporadic cases and conglomerates of MERS in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) required for the development of a vaccine and dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
Since it is a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MRS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the prognosis of SARS, which is also right for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people between 30 and 65 years of age and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 years of age in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care most likely had underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably greater than those who did not (mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and Complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care most likely suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to positive ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunctions in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the patient's evolution.
These enzymes are expressed intensely in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they constitute traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunctions.
Main clinical symptoms: Chest X-ray and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for the prediction of clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period of time in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have experienced extraordinary stress, as in general, they endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and attended the deaths of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide long-term psychotherapy and support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from those of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower airways, SARS-CoV-2 can be efficiently replicated in the upper airways and causes mild symptoms or does not cause symptoms in the early stage of infection, as with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients at an early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while transmission was largely not at an early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have caused significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be over by March and the downward phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical flu-like episode.
However, there have been promising signs in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been managed.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually become extinct or a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MRS is provided below (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the feces, which raises a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases had possibly been caused by infections in nosocomials, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passers-by in contact with infected patients or persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with respirator N95 (series number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the fluid drips of a potentially infected person from being transmitted through the air or attached to surfaces, from which they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (series number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear tailor-made isolation dressing gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected himself with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his swollen eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear protective masks or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered a suitable distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused great alertness in China due to its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and containing the disease.
This message greatly relaxed the public's alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment was wasted to contain the disease on a minimum scale in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious in making public announcements, since each word matters to citizens and can cause them to change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic at its early stage, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective simulations to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve society's response system periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the sensation of reappearance of SARS.
However, there are some noticeable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and the severity and mortality are also higher in older persons than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even if they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which creates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can be positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in the research of COVID-19, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, it is not possible to stop the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can reemerge at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve while transmitted among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it become extinct as SARS, or will it periodically re-emerge as the flu?
While it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these questions and many others.
However, whatever it takes, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Human coronavirus zoonotic origin
The mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses and its guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild diseases, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put coronaviruses in the spotlight again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses have their origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of disease in humans.
Researching interactions between coronaviruses and guests in animals could also shed important information on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven coronaviruses of humans, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and transmission between species.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different coronaviruses of humans from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of positive monocatenary RNA virus with wrapper.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among the RNA viruses, were called "coronaviruses" due to their morphology, because of the crown shape they have under an electron microscope.
As for their structure, coronaviruses have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), shell (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of accessory proteins specific to each lineage are also encoded by different coronavirus lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the betacoronavirus genus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Philogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes for most alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir of gammachoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five beta-coronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MRS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe infection of the lower airways in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (APRS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients with a common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through in-depth studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in today's history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude lethality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), later called SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but present great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force, and species-to-species jump restriction factors.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and the intermediate animal hosts and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for the prevention of future spread.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that parent viruses of human coronaviruses are usually not pathogens in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also examine the trend of evolution of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility often results in decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analysed in this context.
The coronaviruses of animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first isolated from the nasal discharge of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discoveries of human coronaviruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tracts of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, such as headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10~20 % of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serialization in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed around the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a period of disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia," caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from superpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the onset of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and shortness of breath as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and elevated level of creatine kinase are abnormal results common in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30 % of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower airways, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, liver, and kidney, can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-pit lung biopsy of a family member of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to the investigation of human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 isolated itself from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was found to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Coriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 isolated itself from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown causes, as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to have caused severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and maintain continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogen.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the confirmed laboratory cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases have been recorded with occasional contagion to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of SRM resemble those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MRS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MRS among diseases caused by human coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases were recorded in the laboratory, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid to late December 2019, conglomerates of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, who retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and, in addition, called the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude lethality of 3.4%.
Notably, the lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV, which occurs as fever, cough, and dyspnoea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread around the world.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and course duration of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronavirus acquired in the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has features that are most commonly seen in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including the occurrence of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronavirus acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passes between humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still be elucidated in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with human coronavirus acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human passes, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Coronaviruses have been eliminated from humans that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that developed severe diseases from human coronaviruses.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people are infected, the more likely it will be to adapt completely to humans.
If well adapted, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have been circulating in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and highly pathogenic MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission among humans is unsustainable.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as human coronavirus acquired in the community, at least for the moment.
However, it is more pathogenic than human coronaviruses acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful for us to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and human coronavirus amps.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it houses a closely related ancestor who shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogen in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts a human coronavirus continuously and in the long term.
In both cases, guests become infected naturally and are the natural guests of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as it was introduced into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogen.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and perform the function of host amplifier by allowing the virus to be transiently replicated and then transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial SARS case had had contact with game animals.
Further research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to that of the general population.
Civets of masked palms (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were recorded after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that the civets of wild masked palms or farms without exposure to live animal markets were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that the civets of masked palms would only act as an intermediate host amplifier, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals on Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals also act as intermediate hosts amplified by SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
They all appear to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called the Rhinolophus bat co-V HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat coronaviruses share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats harbor emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was shown that WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of bats uses ACE2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter cells.
Surprisingly, serums of patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorized into the same group as the bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The polymerase RNA sequences RNA-dependent MERS-CoV phylogenetically approach their counterparts of beta-coronavirus of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, you can't find a live MERS-CoV on wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are HIV-positive in specific neutralising antibodies to MERS-CoV, as well as camels originating from the Middle East in several African countries.
A living MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans isolated itself from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, which further supports that camels act as hosts of bona fide reservoir of the MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus was observed in infected camels for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread viruses not only by respiratory means, but also by faecal-oral means, which is also the main route of spreading bat viruses.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species hosting MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the future almost identical bat coronavirus.
Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral SARS-CoV-2-related beta-coronaviruses.
The genomes of this new pangolin coronavirus share an 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the RaTG13, with an identity of around 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like sublineages in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4 %.
In stark contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigos in lung samples, which turn out to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of manual assembly and healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin betacoronaviruses.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even lower than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin betacoronaviruses.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin betacoronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 is due to convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterproposal defends a recombination between the beta-coronavirus of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animal.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Coronavirus of the Appalachian Mountains) detected in a North American tricolor bat had a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the knowledge so far of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Philogenetic analysis has provided evidence of events of transmission of human coronaviruses among species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from livestock animals in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of transmission between species of HCoV-229E is not so accurate.
Bat alphacoronavirus has been found closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alphacoronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alpacas.
Second, bat alphacoronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring human HCoV-229E-related alphacoronavirus cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogens in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronaviruses act as a genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, particularly in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is evident that bats contribute, with a profuse collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, narrow social interaction and great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate host, to being a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of the MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolin betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host of SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses, as are civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for transmission between SARS-CoV-2 species from animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through killing or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the intermediate hosts in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody study is needed in domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned earlier, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronaviruses to cross species barriers.
First, their mutation rates relatively high in RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the coronavirus could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the adaptation phase of the coronavirus to new guests.
Coronaviruses have an exorribonuclease reading check, the elimination of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the remdesivir nucleotid analogue is known to suppress the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of mutation of coronaviruses are about a million times higher than those of its guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate appears to be lower, suggesting a higher level of human adaptation.
It is to be hoped that he has already adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the long coronavirus RNA genome exerts additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which leads to the emergence of new coronaviruses when the appropriate conditions are met.
This is backed up by the uniquely copious open reading frames and the functions of the encoded proteins towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses change randomly and frequently from templates during RNA replication using a single "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a host acting as a mixing vehicle, chain change occurs frequently during the RNA transcription of the coronavirus.
RNA of full length and highly homogenous subgenomics could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-guest interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing the transmission between species.
In the present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in transmission events between species.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolated strains of human SARS-CoV and civets, SARS-CoV is believed to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, in particular with mutations in protein S RBD.
In general, the S-RBD of a coronavirus protein interacts with the cell receptor and is highly selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in fragment S1, which binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human viruses and civets in RBD and 4 of them were found in the reason for binding to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental to the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the binding affinity of protein S with human ACE2 could have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study points to the 10-20 times greater affinity of this binding compared to that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-receptor may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, the HCoV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, after transmission between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of transmission between species of human coronaviruses is also determined by other factors of dependence and restriction of the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to transmission between species.
Human coronaviruses must usurp host-dependent factors and subvert host-restriction factors to make cross-species transmission successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-guest interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A complete objective genome investigation of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could be beneficial.
Appearance of new human coronaviruses: start from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses offers numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic pool of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encoding genes have the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered to be important in adapting to humans, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was determined that they code divergent ORF8 proteins.
An elimination of 29 characteristic nucleotides of SARS-CoV was found in isolated strains at the onset of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes guest change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gamma-coronavirus lineages, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Recombinations locations were also identified in the nsp9, most of the nsp10 and parts of the nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses are recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which most likely results from freeing viruses from selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses could be observed, alpaca alphacoronavirus has an insertion of a single nucleotide, leading to a change of frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new human coronaviruses is also driven by selection pressure in its reservoir guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronaviruses, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Apparently, bats are well adapted to anatomical and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the natural killer cell inhibitory receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the elevated metabolic activity of bats could suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the reading test of exorribonuclease, which provides the screening pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They are strongly replicated without causing a strong immune response from the host.
In this lie the secrets of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of decoupling from the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammation in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat beta-coronavirus has been found that shares a 95 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals on the market have been found to contain viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-coronavirus have been found to be notably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-coronaviruses could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have regained prominence due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Vast evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several lineages of beta-coronavirus of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be elucidated in future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the SRM, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could appear that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is great potential for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on poor experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, the opportunities for humans to contact bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing from the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin puzzle.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, a pangolin, or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent viruses are expected to identify in its natural hosts in the future.
Continuous research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid guideline of advice for the diagnosis and treatment of infection with the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and constitutes a good reference to fight this pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO called COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid advisory directive that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People ' s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support his important work and express our appreciation.
However, his work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case, it is necessary to combine any point of epidemiological background characteristics with two points of clinical manifestations to make a thorough analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations must be fulfilled if there is no clear epidemiological background:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed case groups (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as the house, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in images of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing a normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the early start stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some pathogenic or serological test characteristic as follows: (1) positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the complete viral genome showing a high homogeneity to the recognized new coronaviruses; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a specific IgG antibody change against negative to positive SARS-CoV-2, or titre increase ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood or airway samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens from blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological tests were added to the seventh edition.

In addition, more and more evidence reminds us that we must be cautious about asymptomatic and symptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated, as the person without clinical symptoms was classified as "low risk".
The score system should also be verified in other studies and clinical practices.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case", we recommend looking for and complying with the newer guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the largest in a day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in one day yesterday.
It is the largest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported that the number of registered cases of infection included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were staying in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being served at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video ad, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transportation would be suspended for longer than originally planned, until this coming Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, with two men returning from Italy and one of their women.
As of 19 March, these three had already recovered.
More than a million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infections SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea stated, as of Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 000 cases of coronavirus were reported, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Throughout the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that the Russians would continue to earn their wages without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, curfew was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their sanitary paper purchase limits to two and a package per transaction at all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were posted as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Consumers were reportedly supplying themselves for fear of COVID-19 if people had to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to a package per order.
These changes were made after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the application of the four-pack restriction, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within an hour of delivery," and said the lawsuit "was unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected."
Sales went up with a "strong rise" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a special offer on Wednesday planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local city council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It foresees an increase in production costs, as suppliers attempt to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, following the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer on Wednesday.
In a report at News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets stock every night.
He stressed that toilet paper is a voluminous article, which causes a low amount of stock in numbers, and, when exhausted, leaves ample empty space on the shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there were a large amount of the item on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [buy] and there were large amounts, panic would probably be minimized, Russell Zimmerman said for ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they ran out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, said they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain supply, according to the report at News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were made because buyers had free time on the long weekend of Labor Day.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page letter designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets initially were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report of 3 March, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of toilet paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares pandemic the COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Although the word "pandemy" refers only to the magnitude of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
We are very concerned, both at alarming levels of spread and severity, and at alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
In statements published by CNN in February, he said, "besides influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been traced from the onset to continuous global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time before," he added.
The new pandemic condition emerged following the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it will get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The coronavirus pandemic 2019–20 is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international importance on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and around 97,000 deaths were reported as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The case fatality rate was estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide it ranges from 13.04 % in Algeria to 0.08 % in New Zealand.
Frequent symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others, and control and self-isolation of people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and closures.
The pandemic caused serious global socio-economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-induced purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus was disseminated online, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant cases of viruses.
Owing to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases, for the most part, were related to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan, therefore, it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person who was known to show symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last group on the wet market.
From the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two thirds had a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified South China Morning Post report suggested that, a case dating back to November 17, 2019, of a 55-year-old person in Hubei Province, could have been the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded, for the first time, the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of uninformed cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As at 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases relate to the number of people tested for COVID-19, who obtained a positive result confirmed according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had conducted tests on more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to perform tests on people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection in 79% of registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the amounts of infections in Italy were considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States found that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time elapsed from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most frequent 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97 000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, around 80% of deaths were due to people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who died who tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The number of actual deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who died without testing, for example, in their homes, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of deaths from VOCID by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States admitted "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is an understatement," a statement corroborated by the anecdotal reports of subcounting in the United States. This underestimation is common in pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As at 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of evidence, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death toll on cases is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths on cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other indicators include the case fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died from a disease, and the rate of lethality from infections, which reflects the percentage of those infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a disease.
These statistics do not have a fixed time frame and consider a specific population from infection to resolution of the case.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the mortality rate for pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the case fatality rate estimates.
WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, usually stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But, at this point, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen."
China's government's chief medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "it could end in June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating, possibly for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more) is available."
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, since it is so easily transmitted, will disappear completely" and "could become a seasonal disease, which will reappear every year."
The virulence of reappearance would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum production in the airways (phlegm), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people get seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, pressure or persistent chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and bluish colour on the face or lips; upon the manifestation of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended. The further advance of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, not present clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm the infection, therefore, the researchers advised to monitor and carefully examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; more often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during close contact and through the small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; narrow contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, when coughing without covering the mouth the droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by speaking. Respiratory droplets may also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although the virus is usually not transmitted by air.
Droplets may enter the mouth or nose of people near or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore aerial spread.
It can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through the stool, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may be possible before symptoms manifest and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People obtained positive results in the disease tests up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracing investigations.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that while it is not completely clear how easily the disease spreads, usually one person infects two or three others. The virus survives from hours to days on the surfaces.
Specifically, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have touched infected people.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which first isolated three people with pneumonia linked to the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the associated coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which dissolves its protective wrapper. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (linage B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the complete genome level, it is 96 % identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between pangolins viruses and those of humans.
To date, the comparison of the entire genome indicated that pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share at most 92% of genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it is ultimately confirmed through the reverse transcriptase polymerase (rRT-PCR) chain reaction of infected secretions or by computed tomography imaging.
According to a study in Wuhan comparing polymerase chain reaction with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended "do not use computed tomography as a method of detection or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually done with a nasopharyngeal swab, although a swab can also be used for the throat. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be precise enough for their widespread use to be approved.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features in CT and X-ray images of symptomatic people include asymmetrical peripheral glass opacity and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed imaging by polymerase chain reaction has limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A comprehensive study conducted in China compared the results of chest computed tomography with those of polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect characteristics of the virus in the images, both with X-rays and with computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with your hands without having washed them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission; many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members do not know where or how they became infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for someone who might be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions, and use eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misplaced ideas about how to prevent infection are circulating; for example, nosewashing and gargles with mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the bath or when they have visibly dirty hands; before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands without having washed them before.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 % ethanol, 50–100 % isopropanol, 0.1 % sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 % hydrogen peroxide and 0.2–7,5 % iodized povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with their elbow bent or with a disposable handkerchief to cough or sneeze, and that they discard the handkerchief immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance traveled by respiratory droplets that disperse when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Using a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene." It has also been recommended to use masks in people who care for someone who might have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., CDC recommends using non-medical fabric masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or be in crowded places.
Thailand's health officials recommend people to make cloth masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited going out into public spaces without wearing a mask or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask by being in public spaces to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured ten million masks per day since mid-March, on April 1, demanded the use of masks by passengers on intercity trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while it also recommends the manufacture of masks made at home from those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to curb the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can implement methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding busy areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact and physically distance themselves from others.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by government agencies and U.S. health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at increased risk of serious illnesses and complications, and CDC recommends that they stay at home as much as possible in areas of the community affected by the outbreak. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distance" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in touch with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations to just have sex with a person you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Detailed instructions on proper self-isolation have been issued by health agencies and many governments have required or recommended the self-quarantine of entire populations in affected areas.
Stricter self-quarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to do autoquarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies to control an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected persons, as well as introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be adopted at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling mass attendance events; community commitment to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and surface cleaning. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its severity became evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection assessments and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to infected persons who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for health care by two thirds and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but it should be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), otherwise transmission is reactivated quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing medicines.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
Steroid use can make the results worse.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a key response measure to the outbreak.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating positive patients in COVID-19 and increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are several theories as to where the first case (the so-called patient zero) might have originated.
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of cases of coronaviruses in Hubei increased gradually.
These were mainly linked to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, that it has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a number of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause were observed which Dr. Zhang Jixian was in charge of at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus."
The police admonished eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
By early January, enough cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and a major rail crossing.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that, as of January 20, 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364 000 have been recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as housekeeping orders, shelter orders at the place or confinement) and curfews. As at 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in some form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
As at 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of confinement, increasing to 2.6 billion people two days later, about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on November 17.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause, and her hospital reported to the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed on the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan for "disseminating rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially stated that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission among humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "people's war," to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of mankind," on 23 January a cordon of sanitation was announced that banned travel inside and outside Wuhan, this extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled (25 January) in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented more measures to contain the outbreak of the COVID-19, which included the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of the Spring Holiday.
Universities and schools throughout the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau implemented a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote working measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was changed and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Control of the public movement was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor exits. Following the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. As of March 23, only one case had been transmitted nationally in mainland China in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of nationally transmitted cases was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, two months after the imposition of confinement. On March 26, 2020, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the entry of visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details of when this policy will end.
Those wishing to enter China should apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese Government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for the firms. The Council of State declared a day of mourning that will begin with a three-minute national silence on 4 April at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online to comply with physical distancing in order to avoid the resurgence of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, attributed mainly to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, out of 9336 followers of the church, 1261 or about 13% reported symptoms.On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the maximum alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after evidence confirmed that three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airlines' schedules were also affected, and therefore modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best organized program for testing the virus in the population and isolating infected people, as well as identifying and quarantined those who came into contact with them.
The methods of detection included the mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newcomers from other countries through a mobile app, drive-thru centers to perform virus screening with results available the next day and increasing diagnostic capacity to be tested by up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities. South Korea’s society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the removal of Moon for what they considered to be a mishandling of the outbreak by the Government, or to commend its response.
On 23 March, South Korea was reported to have the total number of cases in a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad will have to be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance in testing the virus from 121 different countries.
On February 19, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran spent five billion rials to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans to limit city-to-city travel were announced, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Year Persian Nowruz continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a center for spreading the virus after China.
Amidst allegations of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than 10 countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, and on 3 March, 23 of its 290 members reported positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As at 17 March, at least 12 former Iranian politicians or politicians in office had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times as many reported cases in Iran.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the alleviation of economic sanctions for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases were detected, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak, which included quarantineing more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "You will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events in these areas has already been ordered."On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the interruption of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics on triage protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China as the country with the largest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3405 deaths from the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, there were 128 948 confirmed cases, 15 887 deaths and 21 815 recoveries in Italy, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that Italy's combination of a large elderly population and inability to test all people with the virus to date could contribute to the high lethality rate.
The UK response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK government did not impose any social isolation or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he discouraged social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes whenever possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distance measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two people and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those deemed strictly necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, the police could demand compliance with these restrictions by imposing fines and dispersal of meetings.
Most companies were ordered to close, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government's leading public health institute, announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in testing, which hid the true magnitude of the outbreak at that time.
The testing was tarnished by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the federal government's failure to approve non-governmental test kits (from academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test until early March (a medical order was then required).
As at 27 February, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of 13 March, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, Associated Press reported: "Many people who have symptoms and a medical order have waited hours or days for a test."After the first death in the United States was reported on February 29 in Washington State, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, a measure soon followed by other states.

On March 25, the governor said that social distancing seemed to be working, as estimates of duplication of cases went from 2 days to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, there were 32 308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people had died from the virus. On March 26, it was reported that the United States had more confirmed coronavirus infections than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, 400 335 cases had been confirmed in the United States and 12 841 people had died.
According to media reports on March 30, U.S. President Trump decided to extend the social distancing guidelines until April 30.
On the same day, the USNS Comfort, a hospital boat with about 1,000 beds, anchored in New York City.
On April 3, the U.S. had a record of 884 deaths in a 24-hour period due to the coronavirus.
On April 3, in the state of New York, cases exceeded 100,000 people.

The general approval of the handling of the Trump crisis has been polarized between partisan lines.
U.S. officials and commentators criticized U.S. dependence on the import of critical materials, including special medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of travel patterns was used to identify and predict propagation patterns and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.

Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for people traveling from Wuhan.
Bali was reportedly the least capable city among the 20 most popular destination cities in terms of preparedness, while Australia's cities considered themselves most capable. On 7 February, Australia published its New Coronavirus Emergency Response Plan (COVID-19).
He announced that much remained to be discovered about COVID-19, and that Australia would emphasize border control and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.

Medical tests were performed prior to takeoff, and four South Africans with signs of coronavirus had to stay to mitigate the risk.
Only South Africans who tested negative were repatriated.
The results of the test allowed all South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers participating in the humanitarian mission, who, as a preventive measure, remained under observation and quarantine for a period of 14 days at The Ranch Resort.

For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 kronavirus test kits manufactured in China with a precision rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands withdrew 600,000 defective Chinese masks.
Belgium removed 100,000 unusable masks, which were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China's aid was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in controlling and containing the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided regular updates to avoid panic at Lunar New Year holidays."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that, while "it was definitely not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "it was unprecedented in the history of public health." On 30 January, following the confirmation of transmission among humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance (ESPII), the sixth ESPII since the first call for action during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that ESPII was due to "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without solid health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement."
On February 5, WHO turned to the world community for a $675 million contribution to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries "that do not have systems to detect people who contracted the virus, if any."
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future." On 11 February, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, had agreed to provide the "power of the entire United Nations system in the response."
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, enabling the coordination of the United Nations-wide response, which, according to WHO, will enable them to "focus on the health response while other agencies can provide their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development implications of the outbreak."
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team with China was activated to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in national management and to assess “the severity and transmissibility of the disease” through the organization of workshops and meetings with key institutions at the national level and to conduct field visits to assess the “impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including urban and rural environments.” On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic”, and noted that, although it was still too early to call it a pandemic, countries should nevertheless be “in a preparedness phase”.
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global assessment of the coronavirus threat would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a reality check for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and we must be prepared," insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also said current data did not guarantee that public health officials would declare a global pandemic, and noted that such a statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "very concerned, both about alarming levels of spread and severity, and about alarming levels of inaction." WHO has received significant criticism for what is considered inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733 000 people on April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized that the rights of all people were respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, persons in detention, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the crisis by COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes one policy tracker per country, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom, Michael Gove, and the son of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for their management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) were fired because of their handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political system's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger over the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier recognition of the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The U.S. Donald Trump administration has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus," and stated that the "Censorship of China overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic," which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distraction" of its administration's failure to contain the disease.
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government describing a stratagem of communications apparently originating in the National Security Council, and citing the strategy as "Everything about China."
We have been told to try to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of propaganda to gain global influence.
European Union foreign policy representative Josep Borrell warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the policy of generosity."
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called for the U.S. to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, United States sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries to their own country.
And there have been reported disputes related to masks among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which was affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" which claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of launching a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
Lombardy's President, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a medically assisted cargo plane to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to match if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted on a small scale.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defense 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the different European countries involved, but also of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government was greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of parliament infected, as well as fifteen other current and previous political figures.
On March 14, 2020, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, and said his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak boosted the demand for the U.S. to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea will be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized with respect to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the removal of Moon for what they considered a poor management of the outbreak by the Government, or to commend its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow Governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to govern by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament and elections and sanction those believed to have disseminated false information about the virus and the government's management of the crisis.
Several cases of shortage of supplies were blamed for the outbreak of coronavirus, as a result of increased global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions in logistics and factory operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases left the shelves empty of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, resulting in a shortage of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in the delivery of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical items.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas were affected by acute food shortages.
Measures by China and Italy against the accumulation and illicit trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding an acute food shortage anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to representatives of the sector.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released stocks of pork to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to maintain stocks for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a March 16 newspaper report, China's economy was greatly affected in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been considered a threat of considerable destabilization to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges of the potential consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could outweigh those of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on world supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have been "retorted" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
On 24 February, world stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average published their most pronounced falls since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the biggest drop in a day since the financial crisis of 2007–08.
All three indices ended the week with casualties of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH asserted China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of fears for the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many consider that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, the closure of public places including travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise companies sector reached a level never before seen.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important travel season related to Chinese New Year holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year festivals, while private companies also independently closed their tourist shops and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year tourist events and attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China ' s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year holiday until 10 February, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in hours of care or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a drop of 50% to 60%.
This also caused a fall from 33 to 43 % in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
The operators of commercial centres around the world imposed additional measures, such as improved hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in a situation of extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been left in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the Wuhan epidemic, around 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers were stranded in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government help.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Luis. Confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some form of unemployment. About 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the beginning of confinement in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany have implemented government-subsidized short-term work schemes, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German scheme of short-term labour compensation has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which had an impact on the operations of organizations and on people, both employed and independent, throughout the world.
Culture and arts organizations sought to carry out their mission (often publicly funded) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists where possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, entertainment venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly increasing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the season of Christian penance in Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of taking part in Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services via radio, live Internet broadcasting or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious organizations also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and Gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then the sanctuaries were closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019–20, the 2019-20 Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak interrupted plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled for a post-2020 date but not after the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gambling venues around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to turn to the Internet, many online gambling sites reported significant increases in their new enrollment rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as those on Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live concert broadcasts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous Internet memes were spread about coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction amidst uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people from areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still limited to China) have documented racist sentiments in various groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered a fair reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiments.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and beyond.
Following the advance of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first European country to have experienced a severe outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed calls for a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus," a term many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, were harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata party's state unity in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta later condemned the comments and said that they were "irronous." In China, xenophobia and racism increased towards non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign waste" and destined for "waste."
Many newspapers with payment walls removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus 2019 respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to inform them or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be highly overestimated in some countries.
Through the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be done in respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test performed with pharyngeal hisopates is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people who are tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by suction catheter, or the material that is expelled from the cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was conducted in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of January 23, 2020, the UK had also developed a test. On January 28, 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the chain reaction of clinical grade polymerase (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It looks for the "E" gene shared by all betacoronaviruses and the specific SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the emergency use approval of the National Medical Products Administration of China for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel for the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kits generated unfinished results due to defective reagents, and a jamming in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples were successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only thereafter were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorisation. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of tests for COVID-19 based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, on 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made available tests for COVID-19 at the national level.
No quantity limits were announced; specimen collection and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Medical Care Surveillance. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received the same FDA emergency authorisation for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses the isothermal amplification technology of nucleic acids instead of polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test using a monoclonal antibody is being developed that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, in the hope that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid test for influenza.
As of March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that "chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while results of CT [computerized tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms appear."
Typical characteristics in CT include bilateral multilobar opacities in stained glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, paving pattern and consolidation develop.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, which compared polymerase chain reaction with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended "not to use computed tomography as a method of detection or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, CDC has recommended polymerase chain reaction as an initial examination.
Part of the immune system's reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to monitor the population. Tests can be done in central laboratories or by testing at the point of attention.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analyses in central laboratories, a single peripheral blood specimen is generally used, although serial specimens may be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by a puncture in the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, there is no need for an extraction step before the analysis. On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and can therefore now distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to perform tests is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the start of the infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it purchased were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspicious patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a specimen tube", the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result soon enough. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient will infect others if they go to the hospital or need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In the trials in drive-through centers for COVID-19 suspicious cases, a health professional takes samples with the right precautions.
The drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10 700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160 000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, tests were offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only the positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that by the calendar week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analyzed, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for analysing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, consisting of grouping samples and only doing more analysis if the combined sample is positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI opened a 2000-square-meter improvised emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: "Small" or "Fire Eye" in English), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to cope with quarantine would have doubled without this capacity for testing.
After Wuhan's laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed designs provided by origami analysis were implemented to evaluate up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for liquid handling robots.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols involving heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more coronavirus per person screening in its population than any other country, and was on track to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at the population level of Group 42 and BGI (which was based on its emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of polymerase chain reaction tests with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude to operate outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was not available until 28 January, which delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on testing.
On the contrary, experts say South Korea’s high availability of evidence helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its testing capacity, mainly in private sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to reduce the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of hisopates and chemical reagents were depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to incorrect collection of samples or incorrect use of kits.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the kits that produced incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China that proved to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use." The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but, in early April 2020, announced that they were useless.
The testing, complemented by quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of those with whom they had had contact who tested positive in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death by COVID-19 occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests in the entire population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days apart.
Approximately half of those who obtained positive results did not have symptoms, and all cases detected were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic 2020 in Singapore progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began to recommend residents to stay in their homes, but the schools reopened in time after the holiday of March 23.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantines, but with less stringent confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have performed more tests, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who have only mild symptoms or who do not have symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as % of evidence" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people who enter hospitals will have a higher number of positives as % of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
The constant washing of hands with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, e.g. diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via fecal-oral.
People can also get infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If no soap or water is available, the hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause a disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease from the hands.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate at home births.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in hand washing practices can lead to small improvements in height growth for children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about one third, and this is similar to providing safe drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of under-five mortality, and an estimated 1.8 million children are killed each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning soapy handwashing before eating and after using the bathroom into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea to almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections to one quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent performance can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and causes the skin to become scaly known as eczema of the hands or dermatitis of the hands, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments during the day in which hand washing with soap is important to reduce the oral-feal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (orine, defecate), after cleaning a child's tail (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions when a correct hand washing technique should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or ringing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that on average 38.7% of families practiced hand washing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97%; the United States was about half with 77%; and China had the lowest rate with 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for behaviour change, to increase the adoption of the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times. Group hand washing of children at school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate hand washing into the behavior of children.
The “essential health care programme” implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a tailor-made action to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, in addition to washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin improves by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective in cleaning the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired from previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer is unlikely, as bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Even so, CDC states that "liquid soap is preferable with dispensing controls that do not involve using hands."
Antibacterial soaps have been promoted intensively for a health conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that using recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserve antibiotic-resistant organisms by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic resistant strains, they may not be as effective as promoted.
In addition to the surfactant agent that protects the skin, sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, vegetable extracts).A thorough analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer containing triclosan to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Nice hot water to wash your hands is not enough to eliminate bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to remove natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using lukewarm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is an agent without water for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the 21st century, agents for the hygiene of hands without water and with alcohol to rub (also known as alcohol-based solution for rubbing hands, antiseptic solution for rubbing hands or hand sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the dryness effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants to rub remove bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Flushing alcohol disinfectants containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-based hand solution should be used to rub, as to moisten or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dry.
Finger tips should also be washed well, rubbing them on both palms. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend hand washing before hand sanitizers to rub, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
Increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid micro-organism removal activity; however, they should not be used as a replacement for adequate hand washing unless no soap or water is available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants may dry the skin unless emollients or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The dry effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing emollients caused skin irritation and dryness considerably lower than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based hand solutions for rubbing are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis was attractive compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect it.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends to a large extent on the ingredients and the formula, moreover, historically, has been much less than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions for rubbing.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ashes or land.
Ashes or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that, if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to make no difference.
Rub your hands to foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when they use soap than when they use water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Rinse in a container may contaminate your hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated. The most frequently forgotten parts are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can host microorganisms.
Wetting lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate hand washing when no running water or soap is available, such as pouring water from a hanging can or pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home taps" and other economic options.
A home tap is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jug of a rope and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over your hands and a bar soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective drying form in public baths.
More and more research has shown that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towel industry association, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and the most modern air-jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was detected that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, by 194 % in the fingertips and by 254 % in the palms.
Drying with the air-jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total amount of bacteria of 42% in the fingertips and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying their hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the fingertips and by 77% in the palms. Scientists also carried out tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other bath users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air-jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds, reportedly at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the micro-organisms of the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other bath users and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count were observed after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Washing hands with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel, when no soap or water is available.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectant should contain at least 60 % alcohol.
The hand washing of doctors became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
Washing the hands of doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of soap and water or gel to form foam and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed together by interlacing the fingers.
If there are traces under the fingernails, a bristles brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can stay in water in your hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from becoming contaminated again by those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that correct hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing standard hand washing and hand rubbing in health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization’s hand hygiene guide can also be found on your website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if proof of compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap ( "medical" or "antibacterial" soaps) confers the possibility of elimination to the hand washing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush to scrub and another sterilized instrument to clean under your nails.
All the jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsed, water from the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical robe is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after caring for sick people.
To control staph infections in hospitals, it has been shown that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
Washing with common soap results in more than three times the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that rubbing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective in reducing the influenza A H1N1 virus and the hands-difficult Clostridium spores than alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centers may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and written and oral reminders to staff.
Further research is needed on which of these interventions are most effective in different health-care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is seen as an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good food.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing behaviour.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few hand-washing taps near public or private toilets, although there are economic options to build hand-washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be the result of entrenched habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behaviour change in the population.
For this to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and cost-effective measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce illness and infant mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that seeks to bring about behavioural change. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020, UNICEF promoted the creation of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called myasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-care-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters were posted with "right hand washing techniques" next to the toilets in the public toilets and bathrooms in office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing your hands" is a statement that you don't want to take charge of something or share the complicity of something.
It originates from the Bible passage in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a much broader phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represents her conscience of guilt about the crimes she had committed and which she had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been proven that after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value more the elements for hand washing.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to be involved in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual hand washing in many religions, such as Baha'ism, Hinduism, Tevilah and Netilat Yadayim in Judaism, washing in Christianity and Wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend hand washing hygiene, particularly after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force them to wash their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam force them to wash their hands before and after each meal.
Workplace Risk Controls to COVID-19
Workplace Risk Controls for COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational health and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and workwork and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower risk of exposure have minimal working contact with the public and co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand washing, recommendation to workers to stay home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards, and maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Work at risk of medium exposure includes work in which frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected by current community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to measures to prevent basic infections, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and personal protective equipment available in the event of a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care and funeral workers, exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19, are at high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or handle samples from these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
Outbreaks of COVID-19 can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work by getting sick, by having to take care of others, or by fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which goods are demanded and in terms of the means of acquiring such goods (such as buying in non-high hours, by means of home or car-side delivery services).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted; a plan for preparing for and responding to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Plans for preparedness and response to infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff members, protecting people at increased risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used occupational health and safety framework for classifying risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to worker behavior and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected on the basis of hazard to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. respirators), used properly and systematically, frequently reviewed, maintained, replaced if necessary and disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly so as not to contaminate.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower risk of exposure have minimal employment contact with the public and co-workers.
Measures to prevent basic infections that are recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, recommendation to workers to stay home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene rules that include covering coughing and sneezing, provision of paper handkerchiefs and containers for waste, preparation for telework or staggered shifts if necessary, dissuade workers from using other workers' tools and equipment, and maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member; and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at risk of medium exposure include those that require frequent or close contact at less than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retailing environments. Engineering controls for this group and risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective covers and the placement of a service window so that the customer can order from the car. Administrative controls for this group and risk groups include recommending sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting up staggered shifts, suspending non-essential travel to places with existing COVID-19 outbreaks, developing emergency communications plans that include a forum to respond to workers' concerns, providing up-to-date training and training to workers on risk factors and preventive behaviour in relation to COVID-19, training workers who have to wear clothing and protective equipment on how to use car, providing resources and a working environment that promotes personal hygiene, requiring frequent hand-washing and safe-to-use facilities.
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a member of the crew to attend to the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to touch potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, perhaps, personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected subsequently. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruise ships and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include postponing sick travel, self-isolation and immediately informing the medical centre on board if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical monitoring should be done in the cabin of the isolated person. In the case of schools and childcare centres, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass gatherings, such as physical or choir education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between desks, staggering entry and exit times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, it may be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For police personnel carrying out routine daily activities, CDC considers the immediate risk to health to be low.
Police officers are advised to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 who follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning swabs before re-use and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers are in high or very high risk of exposure categories.
High-risk exposure work includes those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicions of COVID-19.
These become very high-risk exposure jobs if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicions of COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples from these patients.
Some aerosol generating procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests, or invasive sampling.
High-risk-of-exposure mortuary work includes work in which workers are involved in the preparation of the corpses of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected to have it at the time of death; they become very high-risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19, even when they are undergoing aerosol-generating procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some medical care settings and morgues.
Samples should be handled using Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who are admitted should be separated into different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those who perform aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators with filter masks approved by NIOSH or higher should be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of incoming patients.
For those who take respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19, give them attention or transport them without performing aerosol generating procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical mask, glasses or facial protector, gown and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by a respirator N95 or FFP2.
Because the provision of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting a patient's permission to enter the room with COVID-19 only to those persons involved in their direct care, the use of the same mask without removing it while providing care to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protective equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

CASE: [Covid-19] Lighten the burden and prepare for the future
DATE/ENDING TIME: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, coordinated universal time
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that make up the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we have seen among all our colleagues in email messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we are lucky to work with.
I could not feel greater gratitude and pride that all of you are my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation he felt for our work.
I was reminded how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Your work makes this possible, either by keeping the sites running, helping our colleagues get paid or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and timetables
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an adequate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be very useful for the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, shop or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
Although it shouldn't have to be said, we say it.
You don't need to apply for sick leave or paid time off; just inform your manager and help your team review schedules and timelines to make sure the key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, let Bryan of T&C Operations know so that T&C can help with support and make sure management is aware of your situation.)
People who work per hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our hourly contractors and staff colleagues.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it's about your personal care.
What we are asking is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt correctly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and change our approach in order to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We did not plan to "double the hours to catch up" when the pandemic ended.
He will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to set new targets and deadlines where appropriate.
What about PPP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our Annual Planning 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care for loved ones while adapting to the needs of those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning burdens and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will communicate the next steps to delegates and teams as soon as we have a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own care duty protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our office in DC is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in the DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our New York City colleagues already know, we have also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely since before know that this modality requires adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings at intervals of not more than one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over the course of several days.
Set the meeting clearly with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Take video usage by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes in a collaborative way).
Send an email message to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the welfare refund for snacks.
Join the channel #remoties in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work
The HR Operations team is analyzing guidelines on ergonomics based on webinars to support the increase in work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This past week we asked all beneficiaries of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as edits, until the WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We informed you that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to comply with your share of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidelines at Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The overall feeling of the community at the global level appears to be, in part, sadness at the interruption and, in part, relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
From now on, CRT will be working to set up a Meta-Wiki page to provide a space for the community to monitor impact and follow our communications with them.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19 matters
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 2:00 p.m., coordinated universal time/07:00 p.m., Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're available to help out the way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information from this email message and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are being heavily affected today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, any coverage issues, or anything you may need help with, don't hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If you have sensitive or confidential issues, send an email to Bryan Juden, Director of Global International Operations, HR.
None of these changes should be considered abandoning our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that, at this time, our work and our obligations should probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures that we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will remain there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of yourselves and take care of your families so that you can find yourself in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) related by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as a point of entry to cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is usually called hECA2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metalloenzyme that contains zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of peptide M2 and a C-terminal domain of colectrin amino acids.
ACE2 is a type I unipasus membrane protein, with its enzymeally active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is splintered from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane of type II alveolar cells in the lungs, enterocytes in the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial cells in the smooth muscle of most organs.
The expression of mRNA of ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striated body, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of the ECA2 is to counter the ECA.
ACE slices angiotensin I hormone and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, the ACE2 separates the carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also scind several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the traffic of membranes of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 protein with the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomas within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of S protein by host serine protease TMPRSS2, inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing levels of ACE2 in cells could help fight infection.
However, various professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing ACE and standard BRA inhibitor therapy .
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had an increased risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in mortality related to pneumonia, although the results were not as solid for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promising medicine for those who are intolerant to classic renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated. RhECA2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who might have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular with regard to systems based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. An app called TraceTogether is being used in Singapore.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be handed over to the government. In Northern Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a rapid response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned to be used in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geo-perimetre application for patients living in Moscow who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, exposed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a statement demanding limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance would have to be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the expansions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have sunset clauses;
the use of the data would have to be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of this protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined by law;
protections against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to such abuse should be implemented;
The significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter provided Grenzen, RSF) of Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from your operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see next section).
In South Korea, an application-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected persons.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, which is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
The tracking of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large number of published researches dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN) and mobile contact tracking protocols and mechanisms for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never leave the device and all pairing occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy-protective techniques when collecting and using location or intersectional route data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Out of Control Applications: How to Keep Personal Privacy During an Epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly consistent protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect for broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced a networking initiative that they claimed would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, it is intended to implement the system in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent surveillance issues by first distributing the system through OS updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulated proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites with ligand.
The analysis of these binding sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, are protease similar to papain, RNA polymerase directed by RNA, helicase, protein S and ribophosphatase ADP.
Hussein A.A. et al. studied several medically relevant compounds that were then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidaridad clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an urgent use authorization (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under an U.S.A. only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "there's no other choice."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical Faculty is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was "clearly effective."
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who try to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by joining protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticisms have emerged about the allocation of resources to the readaptation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international trial Solidarity.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple phyloviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in more severe disease and transmission.
Early studies prior to the trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two run by Cleveland University hospitals; one for people with moderate disease; and the other for those with more severe disease.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are ongoing for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin's Alvesco (cyclosonide), an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is ongoing and 200 serious patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing lung inflammation and complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women who breastfeed or do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On 14 April, a multicenter study with 300 patients was announced in Italy to investigate the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying close attention to the re-adaptation of antiviral drugs that were developed for earlier outbreaks of the SROM, SRAG and Western Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that were identified for possible rehabilitations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investments and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the targets of the main platforms that went on to phase I security studies are the following:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 possible vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumed to be being planned or developed).
A phase I or II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, placebo-controlled and performed at several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials often involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet being evaluated in humans (following "preclinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was researching the potential of a molecularly subject vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan's International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human testing to begin in 2021.
Projects for vaccine development were announced at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emerson BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for vaccine development.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in treatment with neoantigenic cancer vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that the tests were beginning.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emerson Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, while it is moving fast, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicaid, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The potential vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and testing in humans is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine," to which the German government complained.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The potential mRNA-based vaccine BNT162, is currently in preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of the preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human testing of the possible final vaccine could begin in autumn.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research alliance for a vaccine against COVID-19 that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other partners of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists started testing animals for six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College of London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine with self-replication against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine developed within 14 days of receiving the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced CAD 275 million funding for 96 medical action research projects to counter COVID-19, including a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and Saskatchewan University initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced the evidence of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that "SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines administered by MNA obtained potent responses from antigen-specific antibodies (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal sprayer.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within human bacteria and produce virus-like harmless particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4170 health workers.
Vaccines that are developing may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlights the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccinations against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SRAG was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When the SROM became widespread, it was believed that existing SRAG research could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one vaccine against SROM (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were ongoing, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two of adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one of MVA vectors (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory according to which the virus causing COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the SRAG coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectiouscontagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
While these droplets occur when exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread is also possible before the symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect that they have the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend not to use them, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking, and bluish face or lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
Symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, runny nose, and sore throat, are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to spreading the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is unknown at the moment and is being studied. Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking aloud releases more droplets than when speaking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth by coughing can make the droplets travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside people's dormitories tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can lead to aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, aerial transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spreading through the stool, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that although it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, one person usually infects two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way. Soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and deactivate it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of testing.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses of a related nature.
Outside the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, as it bursts its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells using the angiotensin I converting enzyme type 2 (ECA2), which abounds more in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicle" (peplomer) to connect to the ACE2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, an acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in severe illness.
Cardiovascular symptom rates are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 receivers have a high expression in the heart and participate in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in patients in the ICU with infections of the VOCID-19 virus and may be related to a poor prognosis. In autopsies of people who died from VOCID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes were detected in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by epithelial cells that express ACE2 of the airways, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that pathogen GM-CSF secretor T lymphocytes correlate with the recruitment of IL-6 secretor monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done in samples of the airways obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, samples of nasal swabs or sputum may also be used.
Results are usually available between a few hours or two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but two blood samples should be taken two weeks apart and the results are of very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCRs) to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
Experience in China with the tests has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular grinding glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain may appear, disorderly ground pattern (septal lobulillar entrosation with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (APRS) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without washing your hands.
CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and, if you do not have handkerchiefs, using the inside of your elbow.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
CDCs have recommended the use of fabric lids in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling mass public meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people should keep a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. Since there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, as soon as possible, a key part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "flattening the curve."
CDC also recommends washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when your hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available in a timely manner. For areas where hand sanitizers are not easy to obtain, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for the antisepsis of the hands".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are given supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy, and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they have the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments may be helpful for those with mild symptoms in the early stage of infection. WHO and the China National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paretamol (acetaminophen), rather than ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health-care settings when procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation, are performed.
CDC recommends that health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 place the patient in an airway infection isolation zone (AIIR), as well as use standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to prevent aerial transmission. CDC highlights guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is EPP coat, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, respirators (instead of masks) are preferred.
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use by means of an emergency use authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but they do not guarantee effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications.
When masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for persons hospitalized with respiratory failure related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure in the airways.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provides the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases occur mainly in adults older than 60 years of age and, in particular, those older than 80 years of age.
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, which limits the ability of the health system to handle the sudden increase in severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory distress syndrome (APRS) and oxygenation is becoming more and more difficult.
Respirators with different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take until 2021, several drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe illness.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. FDA granted temporary authorisation to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
You have not undergone the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate whether you are safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-confining, but also alerts local health officials. Analyses of large data on cellular information, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they were in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of persons suspected of having coronaviruses.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared summary phone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breaches.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators have informed him that "in any case, 40% of people are still moving."
The German government carried out a 48-hour weekend hack with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a worldwide request for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel distress over quarantine, travel restrictions, and side effects of treatment, or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety for health, stress, and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may follow a mild evolution with few or no symptoms, so it will look like other diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk for serious infection with the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SRAG virus and SROM, but data from COVID-19 are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In more severe cases, COVID-19 may progress rapidly to water respiratory distress syndrome (SPRS) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, impaired coagulation, and cardiac, renal, and hepatic damage.
Coagulation impairment, specifically the increase in protombine time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; whereas renal impairment is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20% to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average time of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In an incipient case study, the average time from the manifestation of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among males was 2.8% and among females was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (APRS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalized had a pre-existing condition, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of disease mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequate counting of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is understated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. The long-term sequelae of this disease are of concern.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung images suggest organ damage.
This can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been reported and subsequently tested positive in coronavirus.
These cases are thought to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a re-infection.
This virus is considered natural and of animal origin, by means of an interspecific infection.
The real origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to transmission between humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as of December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 to laboratory confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 infection to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lethality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall lethality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the fatality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die of a disease, and the lethality rate in infected people, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die of a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, their presence may provide information on how many people have become infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the youngest, resulting in relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths from COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overrun.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among males in studies in China and Italy.
The highest risk for males is for those in their 50s, and the gap between males and females narrows only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 for men and 1.7 for women.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immune differences based on sex, the lower number of women who smoke and the fact that males have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in males.
In Europe, 57% of people infected were men and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track information on sex in infections with the COVID-19 virus.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAG, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nurses, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to viruses, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations on designation to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
It is common for "coronavirus" to be used to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common for the virus and disease to be referred to as "coronavirus" and " Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials, such as nasal swabs and breathing parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not deliver it within the required time, a local emerging company performed reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves needed during the night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, theories of conspiracy, false information, and misinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease that quickly spread over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Governmental organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Test" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are looking to develop a full virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus get into the ACE2 receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Readapted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, including nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries that are due to report by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and potential drugs against COVID-19 was under way. A number of antiviral medicinal products for the treatment of COVID-19 are evaluated, including: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the USA, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. Results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for the investigation.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it points out that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an authorisation for urgent use for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial s-protein cebade performed by type 2 transmembrane serine-protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the receptor ACE2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine release may be a complication of the last stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. China’s National Health Commission included tocilizumab in treatment guidelines after completion of a small study.
It is found in a national non-randomised phase II test in Italy after seeing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, counters these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, T-CAR T lymphocytes treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no unrandomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a passive immunization method without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
