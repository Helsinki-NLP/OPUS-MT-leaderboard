Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American president of history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded, among other things, for the exceptional effort to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, he visited the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he met the five members of the committee who, in October, elected him between 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then plans a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive him, although the third to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will speak of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the cheque of 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to donate them to charitable purposes, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and another 250 guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
The police of Litomyce accused of blackmail the president of the civic association Společnost ochráncđ přírody Litomyčice (Society of nature defenders Litomyčice).
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and in order to withdraw appeals he demanded money from investors for his own benefit, said the spokesman for the Litomoice Alena Romová police.
The president of the Society of Nature Advocates Litomyce is Lubomir Studnička.
He is currently detained and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate the trash.
In Prague, the citizens can separate the packaging of drinks and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that in Brno the garbage doesn't separate at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a bottle of PET into the right container?
It is almost impossible, above all it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in the square Moravské náměstí, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but that seems too little to me.
Needless to mention, it is also not easy elsewhere to separate the garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
For vagrancy
The thing is, the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several bottles of glass and plastic.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing with the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the Socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy from the city the extraliga of hockey, which shames us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a little bit, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM society, Brno is truly the worst in the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
The budget of "Paroubek" took money from income and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government's opinion, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sickness benefits or building savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they trusted that the government would subsequently ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, rents or sickness subsidies. "That only means postponing problems for the future, is laying mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to pay back the money.
The state doesn't have a lot of options to get money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or State operating expenses, it has to increase taxes.
To everyone who added the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later on, so are your children.
People don't have to worry about rents or sickness benefits, they'll get them. 1.8 billion of these accounts disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year there will be no shortage of only 163 billion in the treasury, but more.
Despite the effort of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to rise alongside interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity allowances, as the government did in its package against the deficit.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion left to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed, nor can their price be reduced.
The best that can be done is to keep them, which is not free either.
This means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a salomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless sack.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Every year the dividends are settled ecological damage, serve to complete the account for the rents or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
Moreover, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to award various compensations to the victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, even in building savings.
It was unclear whether the State would need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Then, the minister will have to save money inside the spring or, at worst, take advantage of the government budget reserve.
A hundred million is also missing for the project Státní pokladna (State Box), which is worth two billion and has already been launched. It must allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will arrive, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to run on two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
Just by pressing a key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the aim of the US company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They will be able to change between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully shown journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware cooperates with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries the hoteliers
Not only do the ski maintainers in Krkonoše worry about snow-free slopes.
Lack of snow causes people not to book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, Krkonoše still offers free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they ask immediately about our opinion, whether this Christmas will be snow or mud," said the maintainer of the news portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in Špindlerđv Mlýn according to their expectations should no longer hesitate to book their stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers in Špindlerđv Mlýn offer mainly weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they'll continue to offer them, but they'll soon give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered remain open.
That is why we have already prepared some last minute Christmas stays," said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí's travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
They are sold very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is affected by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks remain snowy during the week, Christmas dates will also run out," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Snakou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well," reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are already occupied also at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise to us, as we are about sixty percent of the capacity to occupy.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, the interest for stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
For the moment, however, it seems that the hoteliers in Krkonoše will pass the desire for snow waiting.
On Thursday temperatures must fall and, if there is precipitation, in the mountains it should snow.
But then again the temperatures will rise, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom · Global Voices
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent pupil repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it proved to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only does the same text use "as in Iraq" speech several times, but it also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for his own statement: "A New Way Forward."
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today there is no talk of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively he left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The field captains again asked for an increase in the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the indecisive riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't think of anything better, so at least he cheated on the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his goal, to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this procedure in three years. Obama’s entire doctrine generated more questions than he offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is being implemented.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the chief every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, though formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. Patriarchal tribal relations will remain behind him.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated because of confused relationships, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "actionable," a minimal target of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is collided with his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions do not have any effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek answers just when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, such a solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years to go before the presidential elections, and that is why there is still a lot of time to find another strategy, if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers Will Not Receive Cash Bonuses Again
The top executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The agency announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within at least five years.
In addition, shares may be withdrawn if they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite Wall Street bonuses with long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longer road to take, mentioned former investor banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after having set aside nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of the bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters agency, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, the 20 billion dollars.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at one time, with a tax of fifty percent, bank bonuses that exceed 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record figure, today received in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prize this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, among the winners was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This amount in each category is up to SEK 10 million (approximately CZK 25 million).
In case there are several winners in each category, the prize is shared among each other.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Prize winner, the Peace Prize, was received today in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In order to defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential for achieving peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government, as he disagrees with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the House of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also Janota's tenure in the cabinet, is supposed to be the subject of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
President Radim Ochvat's spokesman reported on the meeting.
On his tenure, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The House of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the left's proposals for transfers of funds and increased the money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer’s bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the SDG, ČSSD and the Green Party, are becoming controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of saving measures, imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he stated during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians have long neglected "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
SDG leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
SDG Vice-President Petr Nečas said to ČTK that the bureaucratic cabinet concept with the support of ČSSD, SDGs and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words as "strong sentiments".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by former Topolánek government. It will exceed 200 billion kroner.
Wednesday ČSSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular people were happy too.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by the American actor who won an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91, asked him to play in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama about the world of boxing Milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the abolition of slavery movement, who ended up being a slave, of the fictitious president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to join the rugby players, who belong to outsiders worldwide.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandela's story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
“I discovered that by tightening his hand, I receive his energy, it is transmitted and had the feeling of knowing how you feel,” he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his house.
I remember knocking at the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look much taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety Todd McCarthy's film critic summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well done movie."
In movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The Secret of Splendour Over Norway Solved: Russians Tested a Missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence finally acknowledged yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, previously designated to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimír Putin.
Even their repeated presence in missile testing has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the thirteenth test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems with the device.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not hesitate from the very beginning that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by saying that one cannot simply speak of failure.
The first two stages of the missile survived and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines broke down immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely error-free, according to the Ministry of Defence, only six of the thirteen were failed.
The success of almost fifty percent filled with optimism to the generals and therefore continue to claim that "Bulava" one day will fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with Moscow’s CSKA at age 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will be presenting himself again at the age of 51 for a professional hockey match.
Former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will assist his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play on Friday in KHL's duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another human rights defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and is committed to helping the team.
We just need to settle some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the Moscow club coach.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest professional player in Russian hockey.
The legendary striker Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canadian Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hall of Glory hockey.
Hyundai met the union requirements. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the automobile factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, the unions declared Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai auto factory.
The management, however, wants this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, because it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, 19 December, i.e. we will work in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend the Christmas holidays in one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees of Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the additional work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon decided immediately to cancel all the additional work for the month of December, Vaněk mentioned.
The employees of the auto factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and trade unionists should be held on Monday morning.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday, that if they committed themselves to meeting the requirements and signing the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the auto factory worsened last week, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent additional work.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management was of the view that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The trade unionists in their declaration of Monday's strike emergency also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, trade unions require the company to minimize it.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 kroner for this work.
The automobile factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial manufacturing started last November.
Until last September it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'street' HIV virus
Czech and German scientists test new compounds to moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some already accessible medicines.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be significantly prolonged by a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the virus replication is not completely suppressed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, medicines no longer work.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metallocarrans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarrans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way different from all the medicines used today, and so they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
Metalocarrans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no division of the HIV virus and no mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protesis, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protesis was carried out in a test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metallocarrans are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlina ☆☆☆☆☆ezáčová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics in the Academy of Sciences.
S.D.S. attacked Fischer, he defends himself.
The head of SDG Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for next year is "frightening" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think of its future existence.
SDG statements were pointed out by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say you leave time for the analysis.
SDG Vice President Petr Nečas said that the bureaucratic cabinet concept with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he wants to rely on the minority in the House of Representatives, who tries to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and the social democración towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the modifications proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion kroner.
The House of Deputies increased the money for state officials' salaries, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the SDG proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
SDG before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the government's wish, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota asked for a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out that he is thinking of staying in the function.
The reason is his disappointment with the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government they have nothing to do with the nominees for the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, if the House passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to sickness subsidies, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the SDG are not to blame
This is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers nominated by the SDG have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled, that in several ministries in lieutenant positions there are people who belong to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, to lean on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I have not thought about that, when the time is right, I will take care of it, told the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of SDGs.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
SDG gave way at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed, that SDGs on Wednesday in the House of Deputies would probably vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask SDG Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he reacted to the question, if SDG does not worry about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from the term, he knew that in the following months it was mainly a question of the Bolshevisation of the House of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new train schedule of ČD will circulate fewer trains for almost the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Railways) as of 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will reinforce some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will win for example the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, Drahy for this line will add a pendolin road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not return to Bratislava.
On the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line there will be fewer fast trains, direct links will be restricted Prague - Letohrad.
In the regions, the largest reduction in drahy-planned transport is in the region of Hradec Králové, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding areas.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tabor - České Budějovice route and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced only to a few days of week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the surroundings of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague station Hlavní nádraží.
ČD will introduce more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
As of December 13, travelers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino again.
This year’s regional railways account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive a total of four billion kroner next year, just like this year. Local trains are ordered by the regions, next year they will pay a total of eight billion kroner, and the state will help them almost three billion kroner.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast trains and local Drahy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always a year.
Drahy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why the prices of a large majority of the tickets did not rise.
Changes will take place only on one-day tickets - ČD Net and on cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card the ČD Net price will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was the unique price of 160 kroner for trips between any two regional cities.
Filipino Armados Continue to Detain More Than 50 Persons, Children Released
The armed forces have today abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including a number of primary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in Southern Agusan province.
They say that approximately 19 armed men use the hostages as a living shield in flight to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to hand over the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed men belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the kidnappers were previously persecuted by the police because of the violence, which caused the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of local families.
In southern Philippines in Maguindanao Province it was because of the recent killing, in which 57 people were killed, that martial law was imposed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre, related to the governor's election, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre they arrested the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuan.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, they renewed peace dialogues with the Philippine government.
RSA's story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený) is released in American cinemas, which captures part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose for the leading role years ago.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Its full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. It was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize together with that of Klerk.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa preparations for the world championship in football are culminating. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman however says, he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well for it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as they say - collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the holiday premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. Retracts South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also wears the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA won the world cup back then.
By entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great cheers, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people join and form a nation, said Rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany, said in an interview with LN.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire has caught in the morning a transformer of the Čeps company in a switch box near the village of Vğkov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the spokeswoman of the company, the breakdown does not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatová it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps’ activity nothing similar happened, faults of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman of the ČEZ society for the northern Chequia, the supplies of the electric current were not cut off, and the fire of the electrical substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps pđsobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the electrical conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy of the transmission system to the distributor system, also maintains the electric conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a libel complaint against three ČSSD hetmans
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will file a slander complaint with three social democratic hetmans.
It is Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and the hetman of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in 20 minutes on Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the company's effort, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the cake raisins", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České Dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České Dráhy, which were fixed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
“It’s because of the slander towards Student Agency society,” he said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time having the evidence from all the regions, which he said did not take necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and appeal to the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose, on this occasion too, it will be clearly demonstrated that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and lying arguments, Hašek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million kroner in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would disrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České Dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the commission of approximately 150 billion kroner did not call a store.
According to Jančura similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a Member of ČSSD due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't stop, we'll be able to lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of ČSSD, I know, which one is it, I am not going to say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
Pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the compulsory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute for Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts are also clear about this in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccinations for children born in August
From January onwards, children born on 2 August last year will be able to receive the pneumococal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or before, have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine has to be received between the third and fifth months of age of the child.
Last year, one quarter of families voluntarily let their children vaccinate against pneumococci.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand kroner per year on vaccines.
However, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state spent approximately 500,000 annually on all vaccinations for children.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
From pneumococal infections in our country every year 28 children not over 10 years of age die according to research in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumococal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However at the same time opinions appear, that this vaccine could be mandatory in future.
As of January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Its association has been spreading pneumococal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand we are happy, to achieve at least this.
I believe that this is the path that we now have to take, Kalovský mentioned.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we do not think about it at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the paediatrician society Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékağ Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, one can reason about reducing the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect, that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents let their babies vaccinate against pneumococci.
The pneumococal vaccine is also a big change because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save on treatment later, explains Cabrnochová.
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members were afraid, however, that insurance companies could "take out the money from health insurance".
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid for by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million US dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police claim that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while carrying 90 frames in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the region of the Pocono Mountains.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute may have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52 years old, told the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta father denied granting such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increases in the Budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, against criticism from opposition, business and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "lost" an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have regretted that low-wage workers are punished by a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems."
The increase in social security spending, which will grow by about £3 billion a year, has enraged the business community, which claims that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PREVIOUS BUDGET REPORT
Social security with an additional 0.5 % increase from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50 % tax on bankers' bonds
The rise of 1 point of corporation tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax relief for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance, a person earning £30,000 will lose £90 per year and whoever wins £40,000 will lose £190, while a person earning £10,000 per year will earn £110.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the higher wages.
The Finance Minister, Stephen Timms, denied that tax hikes and delineated spending cuts were a "sand grain in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures. It will allow us to cut the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Finance Minister was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably contract by 4.75 % this year, much worse than the 3.5% decrease predicted in April, while the loan order would be £3 billion above previously estimated.
"Waste opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday, warning about the Labour Party's "debt crisis," said the loan application projection for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, adding, "cynically avoiding" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election, win whoever wins."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction of the deficit in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sandcastles."
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that the timing chosen for the announcements, such as the rise in inflation of some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to accusations of election maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided most in need and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish expenditure data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the Finance Minister's figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"This is really postponing the pain to later," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, win whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget. Markets realize this."
FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy of Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, eastern Punjab province.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, USA, last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If you are American citizens, of course we are going to be very interested in the charges for which you have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances you are being held back," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," the spokesman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said that the house was already in the sights of the local police and that charges had not yet been brought against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported; but said the U.S. had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International Condemns Iranian "Abuses" · Global Voices
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been just as poor, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights record.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad provoked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the story of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face" according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, my neck, my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed to have been held in a container together with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the unrest of post-election and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee's inquiries had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
He made a ski track in the city park
Over 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a racetrack.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-meter long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was pretty scary.
You can see it under a beautiful view of the lights of the city twinkling.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent," he added.
The awards were given for the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will melt.
Still them and us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and when there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American scholar, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Veils" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and troubled the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France with what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane questions, he contends, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of whom are renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They fail to spread this argument fully.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with their Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
He questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
He suggested that Muslims should probably be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who had also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives "a fit of values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most desolate panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Cognizant of the complicated history and policy of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave proof of courage by confronting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, caught as they swam following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation at the beginning of the 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth of the area of a wild adult. The climate is hardly ever suitable: a polar bear resident in Singapore became green by algae growing within the hairless areas of his fur.

Ellis resorts to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Eskimo Indians on snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to knock down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and an amazing look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not like scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
It's not for lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering journeys at the end of the 19th and early 20th century gave signs for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
The cold war submarines then drew a map of the moving ice cords circulating under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted on icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals encamped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system inside the Arctic ice, formed by squirts of saline water that compresses while it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice is removed, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us.
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington's tombs
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay homage to men and women who once stood in their boots.
“In a few months, from where we are being embarked, this could be us,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns in the tombs of veterans in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
As long as her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers went to older graves in World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don't receive as many visits as new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands, while carrying the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the grim atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud names carved on the stones, while others bowed to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped the tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
"A lot after my death I want someone to remember."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobiles and laptops in the country, state officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything that is considered "of danger."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including minor protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an emerging blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor can probably cause tensions between the Castro brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow-paced" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing mobile phones for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba itself," a reference to the location of Raúl Castro as the country's leader, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, stating that they hope the case can help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who run the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube website.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been informed about the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not immuted and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps, when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who they are.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people into al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting pass those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment of the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said that al Qaeda analyzes aspirant American recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they represent a huge appeal, due to their potential to have access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years over those who admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
“If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model how many have already followed?” Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate "action"
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here in the streets demanding that negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center, bolder actions for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated the amount to be closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish stating, "The Earth says "Enough is enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips Peru, her mother's home country, made me aware of the distressing issues that the country must deal with due to the impacts of the climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
The police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified as being involved in the climate talks, activists wearing black masks and outfits planted several explosives near the main Copenhagen channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares, but they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on the climate.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is great, I cannot hear what is going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of each to define whether the march was being detrimental or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence data reveal persistent racial differences
Last week's federal grade book on math performance was very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the best performing systems in the country, the grade book showed that fourth- and eighth-grade students ran faster over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
Average scores for fourth grade white students in the D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
The yield gap actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the gap has only narrowed to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by attending to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization advocating educational equity in the District.
I am not leaping with joy at a two- or three-point difference, said the D.C. Council member, Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elementary Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee’s management style, said the test scores message is that the city’s high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what is worrying is that we are not devoting the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students from the upper grades of primary and middle school, who did not master the basics of early reading in their school years and are considerably behind their peers.
Daily mathematics, a resume of mathematics from kindergarten to sixth grade, emphasizing real-life games and experiences, which was introduced in the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here is some kind of rough dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate political repercussions that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, are confident that their children will have access to excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element in ending the performance gap is to lengthen the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, which she considers as an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next agreement.
Making higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resound.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders of the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
“This is where I will be!” exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Geez, really?, he said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low teacher-student ratio of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh one the children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is which one.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education that they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduate from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexican and Central American, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's workforce.
Those who analyze those with higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Noting low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to implement university readiness programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with over 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, maimed by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away having bid on only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of the U.S. oil giants at the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It'll be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military retreats, probably prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world's third largest oil reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have strengthened ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and secured large investments in contracts for two main fields.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman for the Assam Jihad Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each field.
Al Qaeda’s main planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed an al-Qaeda chief operative this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan's illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading for the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official from Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the "completely shattered bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as an al Qaeda high-ranking military planner who led the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiring around the world, said a senior official, speaking from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guidance from al Qaeda's top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had quickly ascended into the ranks of al-Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a name known to some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led drone attacks has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a report by The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decrease is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site said.
U.N. top envoy in Kabul about to resign
The top United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's UN-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure occurs when the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months will push other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who are collaborating with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Registrar.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
“What I have said is that you better start looking for a successor,” Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, "surely hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also boosted the leadership of the UN to allow its successor to recruit more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, claiming that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermine his ability to attract talent.
So the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, for its failure to engage in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, underestimated the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me down is that, if we've learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates pointed out that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives," "to persuade the Iranian government that they would be really less safe with nuclear weapons," because "their people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and agree to leave a substantial part of his stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have distanced itself from the tentative agreements, in part, the experts claim, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of committing itself to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that were actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including continuing with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devasive sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday "unsubstantiated and baseless accusations," by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue discussions with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and partnership.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that, when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy just for one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of a single child in China, creating two generations of notoriously gruesome children, single children spoiled, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy became effective, according to the Division
UN demographics, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population by 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aged population and alleviate future labour shortages."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labor discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have performed abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 reduced many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University's Institute of Demographic Research, said central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost in the morning, the posters ordering families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although rural city officials outside Shanghai argue that they observed a moderate increase in applications from couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu municipality's family planning committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want more children.
They want to give their first child their best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only the inadequate health and life insurance provided to them by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant from the couple's first child.
Yeah, we're being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said he wants an only child because she too was: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained this more forcefully.
For parents with two careers, middle class, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it's about having enough success to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents' struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of parental time, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic one "must have a curriculum prepared for the best day care centers when the child is 9 months old."
“Most of his friends are willing to face this once,” Chen said, but not twice.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by defiant positions and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying on their shoulders most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not speak of how much money rich countries would give the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what the limit of the global temperature rise political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would cut their emissions during the same period by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50-95% by 2050.
The European Union also stimulated talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday was presented the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the conversations last week.
US Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, with regard to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without the major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that America's top climate negotiator lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" because he said earlier this week that the United States would not help China economically to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the bravest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are discussing who should pay for spending to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change advisor for Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, even though most of the key participants would say that the talks would produce at most a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, prepared a preliminary 24-page treaty proposal early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government come to close a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, descended from the planes and ran to the corridors of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, so that they could delimit the claims that will be arbitrated during the coming week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center every day, activists playing the guitar present night shows mocking the countries that they say are selling, and preliminary proposals are passed from hand to hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for the global policy of Conservation International.
Heavyweights are coming in.
Britain’s first 225 km/h train redefines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13 on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train exit marking a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas Station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the switch from aircraft and cars to the railway would reduce national coal emissions, as well as ease congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still slow Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn up within a radius of 25 metres of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The favored option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another heading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said one member of the railway.
Once finished, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over one hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support 400 mt long trains, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the space constraints of the capital, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to fit the high-speed network.
Experts in the railway industry argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offer this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes that the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made until after a general election.
Even if it starts the work, the network would have to be built into sections.
Trains would initially be forced to leave the fast lines along the existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face mortgage for an orange grove of £75,000 from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built in his constituency home.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "on rations," increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension in his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the extra interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said that the requests "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
The houses nearby have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange".
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of Pound271,406 from his London property to his constituency house, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately £1,400 a month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, which is now in place.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to apply for £1,250 per month in May.
Duncan lost his job as president of the House's opposition in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying that MPs had to survive "rations" after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't."
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was questioned first about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the sterling symbol on Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, revealing that he applied for £4,000 for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr Duncan said, "It was for primordial improvements, approved both by the wage office and later by Legg."
He added: "It's not about circumventing and offending or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within limits, according to the rules, authorized and all.
It could not in any way be clearer or simpler."
Let those who have faith come, to see the calendar of the Advent of the palapa of the beach of Brighton
Brighton's palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each day of December, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. every day, with stuffed pastries and punch served for free.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid clergyman from the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said, "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the Palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in demand of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched through the frozen Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday at the latest. It would enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization for climate around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to making "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the demonstration began in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with cobblestones and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, they are especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinction," stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized in the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold."
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, home of the negotiations.
Protesters stopped approximately 500 metres from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by coach and train from large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial rain showers responded by forming a first concentration in Copenhagen in the morning to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" for "justice and climate".
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot keep saying: there is time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, streams that you can walk through like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, an anti-globalisation figure, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together many islands very vulnerable to warming, kicked off demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters were formed who claimed to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Abkhazian separatist elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17 h GMT.
According to those responsible for the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced Saturday to Sunday night.
The five running candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergueï Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting scrutiny.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili "deplores that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After his separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia attempts to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, she told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The subject of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Big boards show Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian leaders who came to control the development of scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and most particularly the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
“I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations,” replied Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives control of the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus a vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organised two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that will have to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
Protesters stopped approximately 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu led a candlelight vigil.
A few moments after the demonstration began, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near a busy house during incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to the police.
We did not take our eyes off extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the demonstrators, who arrived by coach and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial rain showers responded by forming a first concentration in Copenhagen in the morning to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" for "justice and climate".
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

Oxfam together with former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was to head the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together many islands very vulnerable to warming, kicked off demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated in red and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters were formed to claim action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday's Informative (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would emerge "fortified" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all students in the first high school will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "suffer hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The branches General and Literary Teaching cannot be subramas of the C, he goes on to emphasize even: "nor did I hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged by having eliminated history and geography in second grade in technological schools".
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in second grade C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "no talk" about eliminating philosophy from the C baccalaureate second degree program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will perform an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
In addition, they will practice in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as intern teachers.
If you do all the practices proposed before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose “the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education”.
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Higher Normal School, the experts will have 15 minutes to explain convincingly the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) accepted on Saturday morning, invited by the Ulm Street Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, opened the conference conference "Ernest", a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute presentations by experts, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that would appeal to people and give them the desire to know more, he explained in the framework of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this so-called day as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts of his discipline and selected them on his charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, told AFP, but with the help of graphics in front of some fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he said, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos filmed during these lectures will be online on the school's website as of December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: distaste among prison guards, action is planned
The prison guard unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year holidays, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd Guards Union) asked the out-of-service staff to join the demonstration Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block" them in order to denounce the theft of their assets.
The penitentiary CGT (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "meeting in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", since it calls "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "extra hours, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury".
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all hours were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellery reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I requested the Directorate of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for management staff who benefit from the famous job and objective premiums, and who "always blame budget demands," deplored the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said indignantly the interregional union FO of Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when tasks and missions are increasing without taking on more personnel, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the CGT prison in Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the same is not true in all regions, as some are more fortunate than others.
But in any case, the result is not the one expected, said Ufap's secretary general, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television host Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion as to the gifts: "I make better gifts than I get."
During a special interview that ABC will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end of the year holidays in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to the extracts of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, last year I made you nice gifts," she said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering with humor pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled his favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
“I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball,” the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the home, however, I adored that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in an induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again intervened in Los Angeles because of important "injury" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his close associates, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where some doctors verified "injury resulting from the operation" of the disc hernia performed in Paris on 26 November, pointed out his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "need a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey calmness by claiming that the situation was "under control," and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pains and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more certain about his condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" it would not have been introduced any cannula after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection resulting from Delajoux's intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but said that there was no "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before traveling to L.A., and I told him it was silly to make a plane twelve hours after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, tried to reassure him by saying that Johnny Hallyday, "satisfactoryly reacted to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had had a conversation with Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems multiplied since July when he was interned for nine days following a drop in his yacht.
Two months later, to a general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed having been operated on by a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overstated. Fans and journalists noticed the musician’s difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short swimming pool: first Bousquet title in your favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 Long Pool World Championships, won an international title on Thursday at a distance where he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimsuits were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when in reality many more were expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian relay 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, brand that possesses in long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman was imposed with 20'53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a first internationally.
Bousquet moved ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Festikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my grasp, I was going to try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits which from 1 January will be banned.
These swimsuits, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of swimsuits did not help German Paul Biedermann, world double champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark by 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he prevailed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself in depth in this race.
I knew I wasn't going to be able to beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola sold in USD 1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to the French writer Emile Zola sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art dealer.
This panel 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century after Christ, and its price had been estimated at between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four dionysiac scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunk women, is an unusual piece, since in the world there are only four or five", he explained Tuesday to the AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bided by buyers, without a doubt, told the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Only a few days ago, marble was discovered to be an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya’s departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe conduct by the coup government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya back to its place of origin, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
To grant him a safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to arrive in Mexico as the guest head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my position (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya said on Thursday to Globo radio, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on for five months in the country of Central America.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing chords the deposed president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted a request for safe conduct to us, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, Oscar Raúl Matute, Minister of the Interior of the coup government, told HRN on Wednesday.
“I will not seek asylum from any country,” Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are located in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military, on Wednesday.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
That reflects the marginality of this government against international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, when he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will be held accountable to the Justice for the crime of "high treason," according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial vote, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term of office ended on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, US trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the definitive figures at the closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7,13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies trading with the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
In return, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The return of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% on the eve.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power boo the "Ladies in White" · Global Voices
This Thursday hundreds of supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which about ten dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of those detainees, said an AFP journalist.
The Yankees die!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raúl!" the militants of power chanted the dissidents with their fists up.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "protect them."
On the eve, a similar demonstration broke out against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday on international human rights day, was arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, reported an AFP journalist.
The agents forcibly pushed the dissidents who were booed by government supporters into the vehicles, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners," some 200 according to dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, purges a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities label opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" on the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
Made very rare in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of government militants against the "counterrevolutionaries."
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alienated man kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves five wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) on Thursday at the time of the largest influx in the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant was said to have beaten with two knives and, for reasons not yet determined, an old man at or in front of the pharmacy at No. 85 Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a member of the Alliance Police Union.
Then at or in front of the pharmacy, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, got in the way and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
The pregnant woman then fainted and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," a police source reported.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped through the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: a thirty - year - old man, and a forty - year - old man.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he had crossed his back, explained at the scene a union leader from the Alliance in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to control the alienated person, according to the testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, bartender at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at 61, two municipal officers, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were punched, according to police testimonies.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are numerous shops.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. “As I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in the abdomen,” Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person of approximately 35 years of age arrived, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office submitted the investigation to the Departmental Service of the Altos del Sena Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his pretrial detention, he has not spoken a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of placing him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "everyone disturbed of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again asks for the case dismissed
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski demanded again this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, be dismissed for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of "The Pianist," reported serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977 before three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second District of California.
Hummel stated: “I demand that the charges be dropped at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, “resulted chilling.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before sentencing, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared in late September "to have lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel demanded a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, i.e. that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a girl under the age of 13.
Since then, he has never stepped on the United States again.
L.A. Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to present himself at the hearing."
“With this cause, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing?” Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "asks for a favor from the court, even though it despises its authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce their sentence, also highlighted "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one asking to dismiss the Roman Polanski case.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He argues that his client no longer supports being harassed every time the Polanski case resurgents, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to home imprisonment in his cottage in Gstaad, pending eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down by the dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange ended this Friday aimlessly, in a market that is debated between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points reaching 10,471,50 points, while the Nasdaq, of technological component, lost 0.55 points to reach 2,190,31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of trade is becoming smaller and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve market opinion as to the strength of the economic reactivation", Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, American consumer confidence recovered visibly in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed down by a further advance of the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which "leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The return of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492% on the eve.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's tour of South Africa, the 112 Miss World title candidates are in the final stretch to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Sportist or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
“I saw so many things and lived countless experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone astonished.
This contest, held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast on Saturday live from Midrand, to the North of Johannesburg, starting at 5 pm (15 h GMT).
I can't imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take their breath away".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, Miss World candidates concentrate on the contest.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, in swimsuits.
Chinese host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss World committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World contest.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will certainly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I tried people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," said his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1pm local (21 h GMT).
The singer's son, relaxed, said he would move "as soon as possible" to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection from the disc herniation operation last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection, after a disc herniation operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to attend a school event, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he would travel Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on 26 November at the private international clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem making the trip, as I was operated on twice as a disc hernia, he added.
Shortly before on the RTL station, he said that the singer had apparently "gone without a cannula, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed from a cerebral hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, sentenced by the courts on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "a man without scruples" sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
The latter indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause hemorrhage and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems very risky to me, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former gyscardist party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, on pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, considering that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after laying his hand on the left.
In addition, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his management, he received the help of deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue an injunction to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer to them the property rights of the brand, subject to a judicial complaint.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it right to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the home page of their site, the signatories of the letter maintain.
As you already know, you have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that demands that the NC withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of all support, as well as of (its) Internet site".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) mark to the rightful successors."
If not, justice will be called upon to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Center does not, according to them, have any right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office charged with defending the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It takes advantage in a scandalous and fraudulent way of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to make it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the strategy of the NC: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make its own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that is not entitled to".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday the Court of Nanterre decided to bring to trial the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the weakness of the octogenarian to plunder part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum penalty of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga over one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are disputed the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from a state of weakness and during what periods.
I think he'll take it.
“I will speak to her,” Ms. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said upon leaving the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years now, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter started criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of having used his mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers to be a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the origin of the action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleadings resulted, on some occasions, in a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that his client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said he distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since his wedding, I was never able to talk to Françoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office once again considered that the complainant was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardianship judge had refused, in recent days, to grant her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to be brought to justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule after the trial on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of the big companies towards their employees recalls the position of the companies with regard to the consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of the collaborators adhering to "values" determined from above as before was to impose on the consumers products thought by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to the strategies of conquest of the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no relation to the factors of preference of the customers is repeated regularly.
A demobilisation of employees may result in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R & D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive conduct and a forward-looking vision"; it needs a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we called for a management revolution, which would be to put collaborators at the heart of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, incite the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
Second, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behavioral theory that American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent research of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management posture, unsuitable to today's world.
Identifying and measuring mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies means adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating into any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make part of their dreams, ambitions and projects a reality.
Nowadays, only the studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of the motivations of the employees.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring mobilisation factors, business managers can monitor, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resources management "in place".
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: Obama receives praise from the right wing for the "just war"
This Friday, the American right wing, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech Obama had delivered on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited the Obama award on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Mrs.Palin, a leading figure in the right wing of the Republican party to the USA Today newspaper, and added that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
“The terrorists must be stopped,” he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives was happy, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider as a possible candidate for the Republican investiture for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a leftist president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama made "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world," as "always does," "he spoke as an American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the unconvinced few on the right, a Bush-era hawk, the former UN ambassador, John Bolton, called the speech "monotone, pretentious and lacking in inspiration" on the National Review Online website.
On the President's left, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama "pronounced the necessary speech," the New York Times said, judging it "at the same time as gloomy and upbuilding."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the trade unions of the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon at an agreement that puts an end to the strike slogan and the threat that falls on the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "joyed" by the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators said goodbye at the dawn of Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text in agreement at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by slamming the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "was feared that it would disturb the end-of-year holidays," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for lower wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9 per cent for higher wages (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros for low wages.
“It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage,” Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there should be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centres.
But there may always be some dissenting rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects wage earners, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will enable the issue of extraordinary pay and the modernization of the collective agreement to be addressed in particular.
Bussereau recalled that "a drop of 100 million euros in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment in the draft rectification finance law for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "on the same terms."
TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply, first, to companies affiliated to this organisation and, secondly, to the entire profession, should the Minister of Labour extend it.
It will be done "as soon as possible," said Bussereau.
Opposition from employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "naive business", since the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, the Unostra lamented.
For OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday's meeting, 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP management, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their request for a premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday there will be only trains between 10am and 8pm, at the rate of one train every two on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "RATP strives to provide service to big stores."
RER A crosses the Parisian city from West to East.
The RATP stretch runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in two trains ran at peak hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less crowded than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on schedule."
Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, SNCF said, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement officers.
The RER A operating SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that was held with the management on Friday afternoon will be analyzed.
The RER director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all respects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers who claim a premium that is owed to them want, according to Thierry Garon (Sudan).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, commented the CGT outraged, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of exercise of the profession," said RATP.
Which also led the unions to say that the company "didn't care about weekend users."
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could extend to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Indépendants have given notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has a million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of bonuses, for schedules with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the prokurdo party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-eastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The party of the Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," Court President Hasim Kiliç told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to obtain dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament ( 550).
Its leaders warned prior to the verdict that the MPs would leave Parliament before they were parliamentary without party labels.
The decision arose from a procedure launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, accusing the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims that it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes at a time when the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus put an end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders stated that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in South-East Anatolian, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the South-East populated mostly by Kurds.
The forces of the Order threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of the justice system was to "deepen discouragement."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
Thus nothing is resolved, declared Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfalls may start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is not at all something with which I wish to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter FES
But with this your employees can learn to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
Maybe on the weekend the meteorologists announced it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case the FES acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A stages with large vehicles with salt come out, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, major arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the accesses for the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and sections with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts around three in the morning.
Approximately 1,040 kilometres should be covered, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That's why the FES starts around 3 a.m., "with it the tracks are free until the rush hour traffic begins."
The hard part is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which also the Rat-Beil-Straße belongs.
The last priority is the side and side streets.
That's where the troubles are generated, Brauburger tastes good.
Around five o'clock in the morning the FES infantry is set in motion, mainly the dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
Usually the FES could not handle all bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 am to 4:30 pm does not lose sight mainly of bridges, says Brauburger.
As these quickly become slippery, the vehicle with salt is set in motion as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa fienae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high that ran over the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa fienae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, this is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a member of the Utah Museum of Natural History team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they collected in total the remains of five specimens.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "The dinosaur fossils of the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and also birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivoros (saurs with bird pelvis), to which belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa findae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa’s skull, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those of the descendants of the theropods, birds.
Thanks to air bags, bird breathing is more efficient than mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the theropod with the oldest and most primitive air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the posterior giant sauropods also possessed air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers deduce that the saurians first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages separated at the beginning and spread from South America throughout all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a unique land mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa finds the remains of two other theropods not closely related.
All three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Naturally, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, comments Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line from reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct at the limit of the Triassic towards the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a massive extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slows the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had led to a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction from the busy Goethe University casino in Frankfurt had an impact worldwide.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, sympathize with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police commando".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and diverted attention from the content.
The board of directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial complaint.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi trade union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also sympathize with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, comments Verdi's national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, nevertheless defended the performance of the university rector and the police.
We're grateful to the rector of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, commented in an issue of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Parliament of Wiesbaden province.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, provincial parliament delegate for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left) said.
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of Moscow's ten districts, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg Science Centre in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Various mutual visits took place and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "close collaboration protocol".
The Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrad Anatoly Smirnov headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt he signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises from the natural science research centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the major Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist City of Planning" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") was named after the landscape of forested mountains, where research facilities were established.
Brakes from Stuttgart
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not high enough at all.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, rather than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate to the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end in the middle of the city, were considered at that time fossils of engineering of the nineteenth century, which acted as brakes of a modern railway traffic, since formerly a huge amount of time was needed to hook the locomotives from the back forward.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a station of passage, which is approximately half the way of the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be initiated, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost unpayable to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course also do not have more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new section built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have so arranged.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the great individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the computer-generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road haulage.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing in other crossings and narrow passages on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails across the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 the route has been built at a slow pace.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the sentence about the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the Wiesbaden Autonomous Parliament, if it will file an appeal against the decision on the night flight ban of the Hesse administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts to investigate the more than 400-page sentence of the VGH, according to Economics Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had stated in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the planned north-west airstrip at Frankfurt airport, the Land would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as foreseen by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, whether to file an appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal to the National Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It's quite difficult, if you're allowed to keep your word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federative government would be attempting by misrepresentation of the law and tricks still get their night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite some time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "fast first impression".
“We need a legally blameless decision,” Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been the claims of his group about the nocturnal air traffic ban.
U.S. banks repay the aid provided.
The big American banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state bonds.
The Bank of America returned at one time the aid provided to it by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report by the United States CNBC.
With this, the institutes aim to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had obtained approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had quite a lot of means, among others for the sale of items.
Bank Director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the investment bank's absorption effort at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to raise money in the capital market in order to be able to release its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported from well-known circles, that the US bank could now announce by Thursday the increase in its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the Citi group did not wish to comment.
By June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Quick Choice
In the end everything went faster than you thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative board of the ZDF (German television channel) pressed the editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night the union wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, director of the main studio of the ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely it also influenced the failure to harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter further, if this proposal would not be approved by the administrative board either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender’s dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union on the administrative board already weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the President of the Hesse government, Mr.Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, which under the direction of Brender the ZDF news would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which he flogged political influence over the ZDF.
In the end, 35 specialists in public law, who described Koch's course as unconstitutional, had interfered with the debate.
But it didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked on the station "Südwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed for the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and driver of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The Green political party announced a constitutional demand after the dismissal of Brender, who was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Koch's opponent in the administrative council, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federated states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A retreat of politicians who supported the ZDF control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's probable successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative board with a clever move: he strongly criticized the guild for the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as the administrative board was able to vote, without falling under the suspicion of giving the position to a henchman.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is awarded anyway to the liberals of the left.
University careers clear
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave way. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in undergraduate and master's cases.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the exam burden: basically each module of the race should end with a single exam.
In addition, the aim is to examine the workload of students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination results between universities in and outside Germany.
The Länder undertake to make the structural rules for Bachelor and Master's degree courses in a more flexible manner.
Regulations of the federated states which diverge from this must no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities continually talk about the improvement of being able to carry out and successfully conclude a career (studyability).
Now for the first time there was talk of specific content.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam", is said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
The "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studentability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in the future "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to unnecessary student restrictions in the choice of..
The courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative."
These rules would be useful for new races, but also for the examination of existing races.
These must be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country-wide level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is set up by the federated states.
The Ministers of Education and Culture urged the Länder in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some Länder, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Platinada ensured that additional means were provided for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement mentoring and student counseling programs, as well as strengthen examination and overseas offices.
The Länder and universities intend to have EUR 10 million available for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring a novel of university law to parliament.
According to her, a single exam should be enough for the completion of a career model.
Career configuration should be made more flexible, as well as ensuring recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitating access to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all races about their "studyability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of study in the federated state.
Besides the praises there were also criticisms about the decisions.
On the federal board of directors of the Juso (young socialists) university groups, it was demanded that the configuration of education policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
No later than after the education strikes, students as the main players should now be able to express their opinion as well.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the students' experience," she said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union demands a legal right for each student with the Bachelor's degree to access a subsequent Master's degree.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough study places for Master with the best possible study conditions. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Mr Andreas Keller.
The Länder have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Education Ministers did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"To enter and leave Germany becomes virtually unchecked" says the first line of a poem by the lyrical Werner Söllner in unbalanced language fragments, in which he themes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a professor of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was given several literary awards, in 1993 he gave memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said to talk a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German Literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian Secret Service Securitate in front of German-ruman writers colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Prize.
Attempts to recruit had begun slowly in early 1971.
"I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against attempts to provoke fear from the Securitate," Söllner concluded.
The lyrical Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and her literary controversy unmatched with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that shows the abysses and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, from what is known so far, not only the perpetrator, but also the victim.
In his record of Securitate IM Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of the IM Walter.
“I had excused or defended him at all the difficult points for him,” Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissenter and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, does not surprise so much.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller as early as July in the weekly "Zeit", having read her own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of the Securitate control files is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the handing over of the files since then is rather a drag.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of records.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite great. In this interview a former head of the Securitate de Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the decorated one.
"She has psychosis," in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown round and round in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so many times when there are silent blames.
Why just now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession leaves it to be hoped that the continuation of this story will be more guided by the cravings for knowledge and not so much by the adjudication of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, it is more than just a footnote.
Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart’s VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team’s supplier, boarded a Class C Mercedes taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it seemed that an elegantly dressed outside service member was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer would have distributed samples.
The man with the bald property had hired a driver, because he still did not know the city.
Otherwise, he could also have driven the car himself: at the end of the day, there was no alcohol at stake, nor was the 55-year-old man drunk with joy.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I'd start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the eighth of the finals", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league will have to be repeated in Mainz.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing
The eighth finals of the Champions League (one-way matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return matches 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So joy was kept limited by Babbel's fulminating entrance to his successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who in a short time had inspired the bewildered profis of Stuttgart confidence in themselves, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to concentrate on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the soul repairer Gross his recipe of success that so simple sounds, but that with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a pause of several weeks due to an injury immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the perceived "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what was missing, evidently, when Babbel was there.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator also refrained from overestimating the victory against a defense weakened by lack of relays and totally overtaken by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0.4 the sad awakening had arrived, Khidira thought.
And director Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been reached, the other was still far away.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt did not feel like celebrating on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were re-updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, given by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, faced Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached the leadership for weakness to the board of directors, who had decided to change their coach because of pressure from teenage fanatics.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann called it a sign of a lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the runner.
They probably won't be friends forever anymore, the two of them.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without previous efforts with the coach's team replaced, it would not have been possible to show great strength of play and battle.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important participation in success," said Heldt and Lehmann in unison; and the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Fiery duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC partnership version won Friday to Saturday night in Bern to American Kevin Johnson by unanimous point decision (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform the knockout that everyone had expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
Before about 17000 spectators in the Berne Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was over and over avoiding the World Champion's strokes, so Klitschko could not decisively take his dangerous right hand to his target.
Overall, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely hit the world champion.
However, he is now the second fighter, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," who "does not know how to do anything."
Upon weighing, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so that he could see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a pause of almost four years, he defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained "his" belt from the WBC, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he later beat Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba in his defenses of the title and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I only received one hit, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles into his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company promoting it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the leader of the Green group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, a liar due to false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about Kunduz's air strike, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), for knowingly cheating.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast on TV channel ARD, Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin said the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, which Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it had been announced that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air strike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of Afghanistan's policy of the federal government, and whether the chancellery, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the green Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellery did not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry's presentation on the grounds for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it was clear that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report by a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the daily "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far it has not received a reply, it was said.
The ministry did not speak out on Saturday about the reproaches being made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the committee of inquiry of the Federal Parliament, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Oniric Worlds
In a waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts do the boundaries between imagination and reality fade away.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unfetteredly surrender ourselves to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience sleep-like states during the vigil, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are considered most of the time in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniac.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drugged.
Our imagination blames it: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality to blur.
The states of alertness modified dreamly can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and the psychoses and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts often appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived the hallucinations as a form of waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the dispurposes, mad formations, and mirages of it".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two dimensions and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it's floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, demon figures with wings, with red faces like blood, deformed, gnashing teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him into the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Shrill and evil voices echo from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires out of the stereo, ties them to form a hanger's knot, and fixes them on a hook on the ceiling.
It goes up in a horn and puts the knot around the neck.
Jump.
The rope is loose.
Let it be a lesson to you!The voices shout in a chorus that blows his eardrums, "Go to the clinic and have them heal you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one two years ago, the first one almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, plus he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he has been married.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecution mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning aimed at him.
At the same time it enters into a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is."
The paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For the researchers still a little unknown why our brain makes cabriolas.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality on a temporary basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determinants.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain's neuronal maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it is still unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a prior disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the transmitting system of the brain.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive medicines to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten, from Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
These include, together with psychic disorders such as personality-limit disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and head injury .
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or poorly inhibited; when our brain is hot, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, love sickness or other states of emergency.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a high school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren't for those images and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long dark hair addresses the word to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and goes and hears that boy, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bank next door.
You can feel even their presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he visibly and audibly explains the mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to come, which often comes late and is scarce, he does not know whether he is awake or dreaming, if the images he sees, the grimaces or the girl with bleeding cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
She hasn't told her parents and friends anything, they'd think she was crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations have been gone for a year.
Ever since she's contacted psychologist Kasten over the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffering from a stimulus restriction, it is very likely that after a while he or she will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and takes care of it for entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was in little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he has used reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish between visions and reality. "Each experience," says Kasten, "it takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
Situation borderline between sleep and hallucination
In this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences are usually pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a harsh and painful illness but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
The dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers to be real and that later cannot tell from being awake.
The dream conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis being fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a world of its own and imaginary that is decoupled from reality.
A form of situation border between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an inexhaustible situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on journeys of several days after an operation of heart valves with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he was prostrate in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot was watching for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with top snow and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, describes your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of the outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
The children will take charge of the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they're qualified for it.
One cannot put their children in front of 7,500 workers, if they are not sufficiently qualified to do so.
That would end the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from the presidency of the board of directors and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took over the treasury and with it came responsibility for the company’s assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took charge of direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the top of the editorial.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old. Her son Felix, currently 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a look at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are not safe from decline either: "This has always affected families who get infected by the pursuit of capital, who have misjudged and thought that they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had delusions of greatness, Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything you can wish for -in the matter of beauty and well-being - at your fingertips.
This is what seems to have been proposed El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the commercial center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and pampering of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which is in charge of laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gymnasium, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where teapots stand out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to ride your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and having a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxion.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts by inserting your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And if, after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Variety necklines
Christmas is coming and it is never too much to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party costumes.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
There's a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The Endesa electric company, together with the Barcelona City Council, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the implementation of the electric car in the city and achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, the aim is to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Cataluña.
This is intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has active a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor industry
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector in the country.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has put in place throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of closing some of our main production plants," said the president of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and to the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to developing new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" of registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Salon will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you be able to find classic motorcycles and cars, but ClassicAuto Madrid will find items of all kinds related to the motor world.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the classic engine world that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be Classic Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restaurant; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and restoration; or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Skill tests on the outside
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be complemented by parallel activities: holding of rallies, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on an enabled circuit outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sports
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system -baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved in its whole.
Finishes, vehicle completion, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we see that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
Likewise, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the box of instruments and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
We can therefore say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this Japanese compact features more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to this, there is a large trunk with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre, 150-horsepower petrol engine and six-speed manual change.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its small rumor, for its performance and for achieving content consumptions.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers per year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high driving comfort, and for its contained consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is called Sportive, that is to say the one that incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
Of the standard equipment stands out especially the Rail Change Assistant (RVM) that eliminates dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy rims.
In addition, if it were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenon headlights and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for their behaviour and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the gasoline 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only incovenient of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
Luxury 'Première'
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality from the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexy' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark lady.
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see a certain type of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing him on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has released two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price of around 12 euros per month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Smartphone travelers already know what it's like to give up data when you cross the border or desperately look for a café with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and would long have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a Ph.D. in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated ear jerks to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have hardly had a perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a little something like FonPeek (it is not without curiosity that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this kind of rates means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It is a connected device and is paid for when you buy it, not month by month.
And that's what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a lifetime-access option like the one Peek already has in the US.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is, without a doubt, the American First Lady's preferred tone.
If he has already come to the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him at, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - greenish yellow with bright reflections - the two times the outfit was made up of three pieces - dressed, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat Vestaurio.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was about a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with print.
The complements have also varied: half-heeled green shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a picked up this time, mane looses the previous one.
75 per cent of working mothers have had problems working because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women from younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and career path of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of the couple's cohabitation and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, first start living together, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and motherhood, and have less offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting the cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time of their life trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on motherhood, although less on the timing of the pairing," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they are married and when they have the first stem.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age at which they marry and the age at which they have the first child.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at an average of 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"Another division is also established among women according to their level of education.
While those with elementary education marry and have their first child before they get a steady job, those with middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado explains.
Diane Kruger's worth it, too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to her envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, singing the universal motto 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris signs, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (a companion of Evangeline in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, from yesterday and today - met at the annual awards ceremony, held in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent poker
Manuel Vicent gives in 'Póquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty X-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical appearance, life and work), but rather looking for something similar to the creative character's core of ignition.
The journey has its excitements and Vicent does not save scares or illuminations.
In addition to exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to readings and rereadings.
Here are some snapshots.
About Albert Camus: "In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same one that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against fate, blameless morality and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, senseless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he conjuredled the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed on the north wall, from which the best mountain climbers take off again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
On his own, he sometimes said he was heir to a county landowner and on his own that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane cry thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to take his echo to the bottom of the evening of the 20th century under his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day he got down on his knees and prayed: 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the life full pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband normally accepted that she told him that Edward VII spied on her among the Azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct the fame of that man to serve him as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly assault
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking in our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed by her and our dog, a mestizo breed, rescued from the kennel and weighing no more than six kilos and, without a word, gave her two kicks that left the dog injured.
Our indignation is capitalistic because we did not find the fun in a gratuitous aggression against a small and defenceless animal, which, by the way, was tied up.
To this must be added the suffocation that provoked a lady walking quietly and that, when she rebuked these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energetic who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elder or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o'clock on any Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt would do much good and not create suspicions, just to clarify that the murderous cowards were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among the young so that they consider it fun to mistreat a helpless animal that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Festival together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among the youngest riders, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, as it is the only protection element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and said that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main aims is to develop increasingly safe products.
Sales of light commercials up
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to the employers' figures of the manufacturers Anfac and of the sellers Ganvam.
The good data, however, should be quarantined, since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase of the last month, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold together with all the vehicles that make up the tailor drawer of light commercials: passenger cars, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Likewise, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, since although they are also acquired by individuals, the majority of purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
So to the restrictions of the closed tap of bank loans, other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation must be added.
In view of this situation and unlike passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to private individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who are to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre can benefit from them, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they again recalled the need to devote special attention on the part of the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrial ones (trucks and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a decrease in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As was the case with ABS anti-lock braking and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency braking support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they already are in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of lack is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, by its way of work, it can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency braking assistant does what it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the stomp given by the driver.
But this one doesn't always hold that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, demands the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided annually.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four casualties would be avoided with damage to people - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system becomes popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via a radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimise damage.
General Motors delays the Opel plan until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably on the 8th - according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will take more time to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, claims, is that each of the points of the plan has previously been agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
To this it is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining strength.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets from Saab to the Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as their base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, leaving the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, in the first place, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of the canvas with manual drive, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'falls' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they gained 7 kilos more; mounting sports bacquets another 12 and with the light wheels of 19 inches, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system provided another six kilograms and changing the door handles for some fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the PDK double clutch switch, the test was performed on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on secondary roads in California, on mountain stretches with really reverted paths
Their behavior can only be described as blameless.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not step on the asphalt with aplomb.
On the contrary, we have not been testing a model so small and light that, at the same time, it transmits so much safety in the curve passage, even at high speeds.
He's a small athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short run for as long as necessary, until we order him to spray, brake, recover and re-squeeze his engine...
Whatever we ask of you. Thanks to your address, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the option 'sport' and through a system that modifies the engine's roar, already premiered previously in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from the ground up or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was pretty grounded, but the car well digested the bumps.
The electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that which in one of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, already well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, of the most fun to drive that one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate of Karl lagerfeld, an image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlette of the 'maison' parades, the singer prodigies her malota face with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
The Baskonia is given a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant win by 82-91 in his visit to the complicated court of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous casualties with which Dusko Ivanovic's team counted, and in this way he is placed in the lead of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 of valuation).
The Victorian team was able to supply the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great hit from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do with the final win.
The match began face to face for the blueberries, which were put from the beginning ahead on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already foreshadowed that they had jumped to the Israeli court with hot wrists..
Español and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with whistles and applause at the return to their home, to continue expanding their advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'minus six' of valuation already foreshadowed that this was not going to be the best night in Brazil.
But the party, despite being on the road to rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court they did not win anyone, and with 'the hand of Elijah' pressing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellows' turning the light (50-49).
More inconveniences
Ivanovic's, wounded but far from dead, needed to spin a couple of good moves to catch air, and in those came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the scoreboard to a reassuring rent (54-67), which managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaveses left to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match already had owner and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injuries prevent the Unicaja from battling
The Unicaja lost his head in Greece to the Olympiacos and gave him the lead of the Euroleague group B, in a match marked by the losses of the cajistas, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship, nor by the entity of the rival, perhaps of the most powerful in Europe and with a great budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the inner game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, at which time an action, fight match, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek group began to function showing its superiority within both areas, where the loss due to injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez were hurting the cajistas.
Between the insiders and the Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible comeback
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, showed itself superior and even managed to match the difference of the contested encounter in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group totter the leadership.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last discharge of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja by Cook's leadership and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, 31st minute.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacs when they pressed and given their superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to go back to the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went out, giving the lead to the Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application by Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140.000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application has been in operation, the search engine has found that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly remunerated," explained in a statement the leader of Trovit's product, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from his search engines in the UK and France, the Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges €45,226 per year and a French one, €31,059, compared with €24,000 for a Spanish one.
Similarly, a driver charges €34,247 net annually in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by dependent, with 14,725 euros; and operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the net in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya’s departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president should leave diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010 at the latest, when his term of office would officially expire.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy before that date, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term of office, he has to seek another destiny."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said via telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya said he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya's political asylum status, which was intended to be imposed on him by the "de facto" government presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by buying assets directly and indirectly by barring liquidity at close to zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have almost ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand in the gears as the ECB did with its auction year after year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the risk premium reduction.
Stock exchange volatility and corporate bond spreads have rebounded again, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an increase in the spreads of eurozone countries over Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a further downward review of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go wrong to silence moral hazard advocates who were trying again to create awareness of those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving day.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the Emirs to rebuild power in the Emirates and Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and make its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are facing an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt differentials expand as European corporate bonds do, we should not worry.
If European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their scenario upwards by 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, they will return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur much life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it looks all the way that it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "prudence, friend driver".
Related sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain is debated these days in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushstrokes of what he had raised in the subcommission behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros until 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants are still open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be $60 billion, but up to $95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be directed towards increasing capacity in generation, but rather in distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue has changed and the power will have to be increased.
His bet is focused on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW new ones are needed, yes, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Bill just passed by the government is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to make blood out of the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "pointing" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, should be taken as they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus' handling at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground airport services, Swissport, will play the role of the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, from which the economic terms have not been extended, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Center
The alliance contemplates an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona runs its first motorway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
It strives for its first concessionary motorway in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
French woman Bouygues and German woman Hochtief are her rivals.
A five-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a highway builder and dealer.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private partnership (PPP) to take the project forward, in a business plan under Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the project and exploit the toll.
Pending the submission of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia with a notable presence of European construction companies compete.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spaniard in Liza, and his companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium plays against the Acciona team, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatisations, but there is a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the highest importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the business of desalination.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of raising and managing Adelaide's desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (northern link), is called to link the western Toowong motorway with the ring road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The schedule set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute A$500 million (€308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who announced yesterday that he had obtained a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The ACS participant will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fibre optic cable.
This performance will provide quick internet access to 400,000 people and will give work to the German woman for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the project of construction of the King George Tower, 27 floors, in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale at 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway of Slovenia in the amount of 64.5 million euros.
The firm gets this contract days after taking over the works to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) by 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will run for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs Rushmore for an amount of approximately EUR 3 million per year, the railway operator said.
The contract includes the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that took part in the contest called by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Fine of 63 million to France Télécom for stopping the competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulatory framework.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for blocking their competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore reoffending.
Application Store
Moreover, the French mobile subsidiary of the company has followed the wake of other operators and has opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing the revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange App Store will be active in France and the UK.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476,4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476,4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club that have won the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out well from this cast.
The white club has been the third on the continent that has pocketed the most money for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the reigning champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, more money billed for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body that presides Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, plus another 550,000 euros for each party they dispute.
There are also bonuses to be won (800,000 euros) and to be tied (400,000 for each team).The eighthfinalists will receive three million each; the eight quarterfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be pocketed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which are allocated 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main places, and it has four places allocated.
The previous year's champion gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday broke down the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not oblige him to launch a public offer of acquisition (opa) for the totality of the securities.
In particular, New Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share to be disbursed in 10 years and to be paid with an interest in this postponement of 1% per year
Yesterday Sos' shares closed to 1.85 euros; therefore, New Rumasa's offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos’s real valuation.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV claimed not to have been informed of the offer, despite the fact that the company of the Ruiz Mateos stated that it had contacted the regulator.
If made, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible offers of purchase and the judicial swings of his former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
It is a newly created post that will report directly to the chair of the group.
And it is not without controversy, as the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to companies of the Salazars.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos reveals new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National High Court that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV authorizes the opt-out of Paternine presented by Investora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the opt-out opa presented by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by understanding that its terms comply with the current rules and considering "sufficient" the content of the explanatory prospectus submitted after the modifications introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Stock Exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
He has also explained that 5,592.778 million shares have been frozen, which cannot be transferred in any way until the end of the offer, of which he has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New tools for peritar car
In these days of storms and accidents, not only do car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No casualties are the same, and the calculation of part costs and labour time can be a long and complicated task.
Calculating the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including workpieces and handwork, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are engaged in collecting information from manufacturers, then developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of valuation tools and information processing on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and drives have been released than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car hits the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very difficult task, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and priced.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image is made of each model where different parts of tourism can be "punched".
If it's a over-the-counter model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
Audatex has eight centres around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) to carry out documentation work and develop databases, each of which specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million annually in developing these databases.
Each month 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to make different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for managing scrapping parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard casualty assessment solution, intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint scales.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertises, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its chassis number.
AudaGlass concentrates on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows to bid for the vehicles declared total sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analyses or know deviations by odelos brands.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It commercializes, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a service provider and solutions for the assessment of damage, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Guide to Valuations is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and in 2008 it billed €10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to sources of the company, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will earn 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the Stock Exchange, and now its shares are listed for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet Auction of Accidentated Cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or sinister special vehicles.
The operation involved a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renters, workshops, scrapyards and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
3,000 advertisements are managed daily and about 100 new advertisements are included in the Spanish market each day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been decommissioned cannot be recirculated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as a spare.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even if they have been decommissioned after a long time.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Worker tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the replacement, create budget and generate budget.
Ease of use is an essential conditioning factor for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent tend to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with an internet connection is required to use it.
Once the model to be repaired is identified using its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the quote to deliver to the customer.
AudaWorker is not an evaluation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalog of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop orientation does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it over to see the inner face.
