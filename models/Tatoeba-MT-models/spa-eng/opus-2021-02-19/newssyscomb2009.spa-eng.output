Victory of the populist right in Austria, together make up 29%
Early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, a appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent of votes, losing 5.5 per cent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still is the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of votes.
These are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two major Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the popular ones who called these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP came out of the coalition, the populars had in terms of preference to the SPO, a considerable advantage.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, vice-chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this could already be achieved this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both populist right-wing parties - the Liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would happen in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it dismembered BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction by the European Union.
For this evolution Haider clearly bets who already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore is not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles cannot be solved, it could lead to a cooling down of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this were not resolved then yes, then this cooling would surely be achieved," he said after the meeting that was organized on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get involved.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempt from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government may negotiate with the local government of Darjiling whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest authorities.
He can then request the exoneration of the case and await the release of the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the High Court and then a pardon would be possible," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted person "a competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already achieved by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize him," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, before her colleague she insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a huge mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would take care of the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises," he said.
A Czech arbitrates a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, on it is represented Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small lost spot in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and Sea Affairs.
Its head, Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
Rule this skill and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed hides to this day a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms until today that themselves carry the key to the development of anticancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the mainland.
The countries with coasts have today begun to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is essentially the so-called Continental Border which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Border.
"Simply speaking, the continental border means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the subwater continent.
It reaches the limit of the coast of the sea, and often to the border of 200 nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Border continent, must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist support commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries have made progress," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine domain.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the seabed area that was granted by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains in their study.
The profit to be derived from the use of the seabed will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the continental border ends, the region of the ocean floor declared by Treaty as "the common heritage of humanity" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is no gold mine," Director Mikulka says emphatically, adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its contract-defined regime."
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is divided with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as well as other few states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom over there is bumpy, it's kind of like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, who according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages, the German special forces command was at the place of action.
To resolve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are being learned about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the ministry of defense and the ministry of the interior in the action of salvation, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore at the place of liberation were specialists of the German army as well as officers of GSG 9, flight squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity institution.
As ministry spokesmen reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The government of Egypt accepted Germany's help to use it as support on site.
"Fortunately this was not the time," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt the assailants had kidnapped a group of travellers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian, as well as 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping of the hostages in the desert region of southern Egypt, they were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the saved and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He didn't say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
United States House of Representatives does not approve of the Salvation Package
The first chamber of the Congress of the United States left to fail with little a big $700 billion saving package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's package to save the financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite all calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties he did not reach a majority for the program with which the disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked the deputies to take a vote although the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was the concerns of investors that the state salvation package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, fell again.
The experts have other serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order to allow the current program to enter, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel reservations for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened conjuncture, the Germans' desire to travel remains as before.
As reported on Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel reservations for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more in comparison with the same period last year.
According to research by the GfK market research institute, reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent higher than in 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar, mainly travel to the United States is in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost one third.
Germany's preferred destinations are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece, but also the regions of Germany.
Above all, organized travel is highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months travel was well booked, so that the volume of sales compared to last year rose again - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, comparing last year, dropped.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Spa, the beer in one liter jars and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes of designers.
A tent debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian suit to measure.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: as soon as we are in a tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it is very flattering above all because I am first time in Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in a traditional Bavarian outfit until this day was still limited.
But after arriving at Teresa's Prado everything is no big deal.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian suits or leather pants; no one seems to be listening or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A munique calls my attention to my apron that was dressed in the wrong way: "The left side is single, half is virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is widow."
O God, now I'm fastening from behind to the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others do not care many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it is written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their ass knot.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is named Bob, is from England and is also for the first time in the Oktoberfest.
To him it looks like "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after he put next to him his glass of a liter of beer that he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire hydrant, most people think that's a trash can.
So Bob's one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
At about eight o'clock at night, the restroom groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear each time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covers from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They arrive sober, they return drunk.
You don't see who suffers from the degrees of alcoholemia and is in the walks.
"They're the ones who "can't do more," the answer was given to me by a nurse answering my question and disappeared in tumult.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being beaten by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood City, was implicated in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers nested the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha Train Station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set at the end of the platforms and faces two towers, one for each corner, looking like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decadent.
But once the vault box office is over, there's no question what the company's greatness was that this was the most western gate.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that was curing to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha Station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that this was sabotage.
Since then the station has fallen and remained on the sidelines of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new partnership policy.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went on a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolt trip, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived at the Turkish capital - new city, designed to govern a new secular state, away from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigmatic change in the Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and "power pastries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet first thing in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and West at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "Turkey might be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he answers, "does not want to affront that choice."
He then underlines one point that almost everyone I have spoken to so far has recited to me almost by heart: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again to the station of Hydarpasha, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt as to which continent this fascinating country should claim.
Remembering Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (esquela, 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for those under 21, but at the time when the Proteus sang his ending in 1979, several of us were finishing the 20 - we just refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer of forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, indifferently if not accompanied or with complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So you just have to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxed, nor too flowery.
Anywhere the musical scarring, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the two decades in which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and can honestly say that I have never, by any, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of grandeur and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two well-known war horses around the world."
We're gonna miss it a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) you claim that "in 1946 he resumed economic history studies at Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate."
This is learned in a note from Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which season he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention because of their simplicity and the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second round for Honda's bestseller
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
In addition, refined mechanics increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation into the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe Jazz is less well known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million Jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm commercialized a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a growth of 17% in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to mitigate to a large extent the decline of sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a drop of 16%.
Despite this increase in Honda sales it has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also hopes to achieve 2% by 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - from which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to Japanese manufacturer estimates, 50% of Insight sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented in partnership in January in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz grows at all levels.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2.50 meters, an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1,52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - rises to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measurements are from the version with engine 1.4, since the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as back LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees in the first Jazz.
Also new are the engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will have two petrol propellers of 1,2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre mechanics achieve a power of 90 horses at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 turns.
This propellant - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has an expense of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
As for the previous propellant, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, it now becomes 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that prevents collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the Safety Shield of four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capacity of the vehicles of the brand.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval shaped personal space that looks a lot like Nissan's Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of the bee, able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser range Finder.
It detects obstacles up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately translates into collision prevention.
"The moment you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right angle or higher to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can function continuously with just a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about gigas by memory, not even megas."
This is the first step in developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced into standard cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles along the way.
Tremble before mortgage
Admittedly, the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid for injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created a pleasant and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the bad credit hotel... or the mess.
The grim aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
True, it has useful information, but little detail.
It's more of a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What if the game is completed?
Well, there's a dream room in the hotel.
Something's something, because we don't even talk about buying a better house...
Morgan Stanley sells share to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock exchange listing.
A week after discovering an interim agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the overall operation would be carried out on the basis of a unit price of $29, i.e. 28% above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley stock however lost 6.79 percent to 23.07 dollars each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status," explained Juan Mack, the CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he makes it happen under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt far more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for almost 8.5 billion dollars.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "we thought the participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves. "
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities by 7 % below its book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the benefit per action.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares within one year if they are sold at more than 50 % above the conversion price, or $47 or less, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow him to take investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group nevertheless refused to elaborate on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had greatly relieved his balance since late August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its stock exchange price drop by half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost fell back last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced raising $15 billion, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, he is the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results referring to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted on the way out of the polling stations and a recount by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad "yes" victory, estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday to Monday night.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly", had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who headed the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies increasing the power of the State over the economy, reserving to it the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to currencies sent by their emigrants.
Carried by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants reinforced powers to the head of State, who can make up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and intend a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services, which the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
At last it foresees the interdiction of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 abducted persons have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good on arrival at 15H30 on board a special aircraft to the Al Maza military base adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo medical tests, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garana declared at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages were held by 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari on SUVs in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since passed from one Zulo to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian- and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
" An exchange of fire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said this responsible who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightlight" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said without going into details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
On the eve, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an SUV aboard which the kidnappers were present, killing six of them, including the Chadian chief and arresting two of them.
He also stated that they were related to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unit (SLA-U), an allegation immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of the fait les manchettes culture and occupies the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But one sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned to search history, to preserve lots of private archives with little money and to preserve archaeological remains.
These are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible launch their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
By when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of Fortis Bank.
The states of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in distress due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total 11.2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has businesses in Hungary.
This weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's economic competition officer.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer from the crisis in the Euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that has been taking place in several waves more than a year ago, so the decisions taken with regard to the Bank can in a sense be regarded as precedents.
According to the decision taken in the early morning of Sunday, the three states will buy approximately half (49 percent) of the property held by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a part of its business, including mainly the activities – mainly insurance – purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis actions started a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However analysts agree to point out that with its 85 thousand employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break.
The company's shares on Friday alone decreased by 12 percent, with this being the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares decreased by more than two thirds.
Looking at the current prices of the shares, the total value of the group's capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's management pushed the sharp fall of Fortis shares to the American market's insecurities in connection with the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday the shares already showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had already assured that investors had nothing to worry about, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank's clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch office in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract by viewing the data on drug purchases.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which joins the use of the data of the recipes in all cases to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the fox henhouse" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and compensation amount dependent on the customer's health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They first sent the client to medical check-up and signed the contract with him knowing the outcome of the check-up.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer's identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the diseases and health status of the client.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that the level of fat in your blood is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Many versions of the program circulate, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has hardly anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this respect.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances serve both to treat headache as well as for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the former do not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, request the patient's approval.
The authorities already force them to do this, although they were not fined for the negligence of so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of the laboratory tests, and linking them to the data on drug use obtain more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and health service providers.
The bill providing for the right to the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is now before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because if not the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are reciprocal trading partners, this issue, in addition to the other largely global problems, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs but the member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator as to whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Office, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana Principal Representative of Foreign Policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase their trade to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
They have thus legally harmonized the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation conventions with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also called for, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20%.
India also agrees with this, just as next year's climate conference should reach a global agreement and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wished to hinder the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers to the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book waits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles in exhibition and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will continue a meeting with the print in the Room Struktur in the 5.0 pavilion of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing houses in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors gradually decreases over the total Italian production, and in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the missing millionaire a year ago.
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The rubble has been found on a plateau at 3000 meters altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada of Mammoth Lakes, in the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wood County commissioner John Anderson has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have the confirmation that it is typical of that about which Steve Fossett was flying the day of his disappearance" he said in a print conference.
The commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
The 63-year-old millionaire was considered dead in February.
The American office for transport safety (Ntsb) has made it known that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squadron of researchers has been sent that has identified the apparatus: it is typical of the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerrington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the border of Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents under the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, at the sixth tempt, he had become the first Man to complete the turn of the world in a hot air balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world turn by plane and without stopovers.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters in height, over the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv outside the schematics with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
It is this, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Owned by the out-of-traditional content, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that accompanied the launch of the Suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition halls since next October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central street of Milanese shopping, Como Avenue, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed in the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will have the impression that the car leaves outside the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
Mercedes with this advertising is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of car communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Trivenet, the ban on access to sporting events is at stake.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been going on for years the Italian National and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fans either.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these Sofia have been added a small group (a few units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have flags of three colors where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been removed so that they are not identified.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the minister of the interior had already controlled them all: among what had gone out for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of stage crime, have been refused the ticket and also the trip.
Now the ministry of the interior expects to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fanatics who have been arrested or identified in the messes.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those from all over Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Luckily!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty others may be added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they say of the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why "well-opened eyes" especially in view of Wednesday's National Party in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small core of holders from Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is the secret service, that deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choruses of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria non is a reato..."
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the position that before was Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste public security where there is a core of holders of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a reato to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics that has been shameful.
"I don't do the sociologist – adds the Observatory's n.1 – the challenges are attributed in the countries in which the event happens.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to Mameli's anthem: those are also not a challenge, but if they allow, they are not of education..."
