Members of the Welsh House of Representatives are afraid of looking stupid.
Some members of the House of Representatives have been puzzled by the proposal that they should be replaced by MWP, a Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The Court began its plan to change the name of the representative to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the House of Representatives, regardless of party affiliation, are concerned that the change may make them the target of ridicule.
According to one Labour Party representative, the group is concerned that the name "thinest words with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means cake.
According to one Plaid party representative, the group's majority "is not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to the Conservative Party's representative, his group views the name change as an "open mind", but notes that the word MWP is a short succinct word for a stupid word.
In Welsh, the w-letter is pronounced in this context in the same way as the Yorkshire English u-letter.
The Commission, which is currently making the necessary legislative changes to the name change, stated as follows: "The final decision on the names of the members of the representative body belongs, of course, to the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the House of Representatives the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, which found that the appointment of a representative to the Welsh Parliament enjoys broad support.
The Commission favours, in the opinion of the members of the House of Representatives, the WMP or the WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion poll.
Members of the House seem to be proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus could lead to the chairperson-in-chief, Elin Jones, who is expected to make the proposed amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also includes other amendments to the activities of the representative body, such as the loss of representation and the rules on the format of the committee system.
In the legislative debate, the members of the House of Representatives may give their final vote on the name by which they should be invited.
Macedonian voters go to the polls in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve decades-long disputes with Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens has reiterated that the name of the northern neighbor is in practice a territorial requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said that he would abstain from the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaevi, argue that the name change is simply a price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
The clocks of St. Martin's are silent as the churches of Harlem live in difficult times
“The elderly people I’ve talked to say that before every street corner there was a bar or a church,” Adams says.
"There are none today."
He said the loss of bars is understandable.
He said, "People's behavior has changed."
“Bars are no longer common rooms in the neighborhood where people meet regularly.”
For the churches, he is concerned that the sale of property will not go as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the starting point."
He added that churches can be replaced by dwellings and apartments that the people living in are not those that support the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“Of the vast majority of people who buy apartments from these buildings, there will be white people,” he says, “and thus they will have a day when these churches will finally close their doors because it is unlikely that most of the people who convert to these apartments would become a member of this group of people.”
Both churches were built by white-collar congregations before Harlem became a black-collar settlement - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church moved away in the 1930s.
A nearby congregation of blacks acquired the building as their property.
St. Martins was taken over by a congregation of blacks led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the merchants of 125th Street, Harlem's central trading district, who were opposed to hiring or raising blacks.
When Father Johnson’s congregation members planned to rebuild the building, they set up a tower clock game, which was badly damaged by a fire in 1939.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and a follower of St. Martins, proudly called the towering clock game "the clock of poverty".
The expert who played the tower clock game in July called it by another name: "cultural art" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first towering game played by black music. It was Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger towering game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins did not replace him.
St. Martin’s has developed a complex council in recent months, which includes architects and contractors hired by the church’s landowners and, on the other hand, by the episcopal council.
Sakasti, an administrative body made up of the church’s landowners, wrote to the council in July expressing concern that the council would “try to offset the costs” of Sakasti, even though Sakasti had not participated in the salaries of architects and contractors sent by the council.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency regarding the church.
A 13-year-old smoker was injured in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while diving into the hummers on the opening day of the hummingbird season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and a group of others were yelling at the boy to help with this water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was just excited to be picked up by a hummer, but then realized he was screaming, "I'm in trouble!"
I got carried away!”
Upon his release, Hammel says he noticed that this whole cell had been torn open.
"I told everyone to get out of the water, 'There's sharks in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of shark that attacked is not known.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said at a news conference that sharks had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim had serious injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed the beaches from Casablanca's Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury’s plans for the UK’s beauty care industry
Sainsbury’s challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams’ department of department of department of department of department of beauty care with expert advisors.
This is a significant move for the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty care sector, which will continue to grow even though the sales of fashion and home goods are declining. The major beauty care departments are experimenting in 11 stores across the country, and will not succeed in selling them in another year.
Beauty products are being invested in as supermarkets seek to fill the shelf space that was previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s tells of its beauty care range for 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific brands like their Boots stores.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique make-up range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers demand it more and more.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop is experimenting with rental shops in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the move of grocery shopping to small one-time purchases in nearby stores will force supermarkets to invent new lures for customers.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look even more like department stores as the supermarket chain fights against cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and other non-food products.
After purchasing both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, as well as Habitat stores. The company says this has contributed to the sale of food and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renovate its beauty care and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended in a dispute over how the profits of pharmacies located in supermarkets should be shared.
The new strategy follows a business deal in which Sainsbury's sold 281 stores to Celesio, owner of its Lloyds Pharmacy chain, <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds is part of a plan to expand the range of premium skin care products in four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial manager at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our beauty care departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are ready to provide advice to customers.
Our range of brands meets all of our needs and attractive surroundings, and our convenient location makes us a compelling beauty shop that challenges the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'in his groove' Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "in his groove" when TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home-made food and accessories brand for Truey.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
This Morning, a 37-year-old programmer, announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby ousted Dragons Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute and now plans to focus on her new giant deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was in his "whistle" last Tuesday at a thrilling meeting held at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. TV star had admitted that her new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million contract would not be worth a penny.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand, and it was run on an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth of property by Willoughby.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, “Truly was clearly Holly’s most important project.
It was his long-term plan, which was to ensure his survival for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone in shock.
No one could believe Tuesday's events so close to publication.
Marlow’s headquarters have a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold.”
This Morning is one of the UK’s most reliable stars, and according to experts, its departure could cause the company a million losses due to product investments, including everything from cushioning to candles and clothing to home-cooking, not to mention advertising.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby hosted Cappin Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones became president in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is hired by M&S's new brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity's ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We didn’t comment on his business.”
Close talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media from a comment that some would consider inappropriate for the president, as well as his compliments to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said by making a “news anchor” sound.
“I didn’t give up.”
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had ignited the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, the nuclear negotiations have stalled.
After more than three months of Singapore’s summit in July, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees no “responsive response” from the United States to North Korea’s early deployment.
Instead, he said, the United States will continue to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure on.
Trump had a much more optimistic view.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have such an excellent relationship.”
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. The missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been helped to freedom and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 more out of this crowded hall, we’d have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing directly at the audience.
Indonesia's Tsunami and Contagion Destroyed Island, Hundreds Killed
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign voluntary organizations were told that they were not needed.
The national state of emergency required for international assistance was not declared, although about 10 per cent of Lombok’s residents had remained homeless.
“In some cases, they have unfortunately made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so the situation is a bit challenging,” Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is a traveling group, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, the national disaster agency’s spokesman, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation with regard to whether international organisations would be allowed to participate in the aid work.
Indonesia continues to be unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account regularly recurring earthquakes.
Although tsunami showers have been built in Acehi, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The fire was likely lost due to a tsunami warning siren lacking human spirits, even though the warning was in effect.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is challenging even in the best conditions.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship ordered to help victims of the Lombok earthquake is on its way back, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has made the development of past infrastructure in Indonesia central to his election campaign, and he has spent money on improving roads and railways.
However, there is a financial need for some governments, while the new elections are approaching next year.
The pressure on the river is also heightened by tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the country’s Muslim majority has adopted a more ancient form of religion.
Christians and Muslim warriors have been fighting in the streets with jungle knives, sticks and arrows, as well as other basic weapons. This has led to the deaths of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to England on Saturday after scoring 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was fed by Xherdan Shaqir 27 away from Chelsea when his team was in the losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before horrifying towards the shot.
The shot hit a high penalty area over the right upper corner.
Eventually, the ball dropped over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to make myself play to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as much as possible upwards, so I was just trying to create myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kant approaching, took one touch, and fired without thinking about the movements.”
Chelsea led the match in a 1-0 Belgian Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In the situation, the Blues tip gave Mateo Kovacic a foothold before cycling away near the middlefield and asking Liverpool's midfielder.
Kovacic played a fast-paced wall-eating midfield.
Then he released Hazard into the penalty area with a magnificent handout.
Hazard escaped from the defence and crossed Liverpool's Alisson Becker's left leg with a shot to the back.
Liverpool will meet in the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in London on Thursday at 3 p.m. in the UEFA Europa League.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
Indonesia’s Disaster Response Agency reported an increase in the number of earthquake and tsunami deaths to 832 victims on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo, the agency’s spokesman, said at a news conference that many had been left in the rubble of collapsed buildings when a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Friday and lifted up waves as high as six metres.
The ruins of the ruined buildings spread widely to the town of Palu, 380,000 inhabitants.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death
The body of a woman found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning, has been charged with murder.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed to death at 7:55 a.m. by Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police will ask the people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Commissioner Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to all those near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard video to contact the police, who may have vital information for the investigation.”
A female police informant has confirmed that the woman who was found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, the crime scene has been visited by people who may have known the woman, who have asked about her whereabouts.
As the investigation continues, the police say they are trying to inform the victim of what happened.
The taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police had said no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it is possible to go for hours before they are released back in.
A police officer was told to tell the man that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene of the incident.
He repeated, “It’s terrible.”
There were two Mayans in the isolated area at two o'clock in the afternoon, and a third outside.
In the isolated area, there were several police officers who guarded the apartment building.
Everyone who knows something is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 using ID 247 on September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell passport also became part of history's rewrite package
The destruction of the statue would be a cruel right, given that his own fanatical Puritan supporters destroyed England's cultural and religious monuments like the best Taliban.
However, Cromwell described Crick's proposal as "a typology" and "a rewrite of history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing dispute over the removal of the stakes would paint a picture of Oliver Cromwell’s patisserie in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or carry out the iconoclasms of the English Civil War.
Cromwell may have to suffer from the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent description of Cromwell expresses the 19th century’s views and it is historical evidence of the character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, although perhaps more in the 19th century than today, hold Cromwell as a defender of parliament against the external pressure, which in this case was of course caused by the monarchy.
Is it then a precise description of the subject a subject of ongoing historical debate?
What is certain is, at least, that the dispute of the mid-1600s has shaped the later development of our nation; Cromwell must in turn identify a character who represents the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a public servant deserve praise and remembrance.”
The killer killed the life of a Chinese farmer.
Local media reported that the pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a tower in southern China.
Only the body of a man identified as "Yuan" was found near Liupanshui Square in Guizhou province. The man's condition had broken and he was high in blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
She was informed that she and her cousin were travelling from nearby Yunna province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the square.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he noticed that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said he had seen a big bear with a mouth in his blood.
According to the news, a criminal investigation confirmed the life of a 250-kilometer-long cattle rancher.
Guiyang Evening News newspaper reports a cousin named "Wu" saying that "my cousin's legs were bloody and scratched".
The surveillance camera image shows a herd arriving at the tower feeding pigs Thursday morning at 4.40 am.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the march leaders told the Evening News that the pig had been stuffed behind the locks so that it would not harm other police when collecting evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the customs authorities are reported to be negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs are known to have attacked people in the past, although it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts. The man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-kilogram pig was scouring the Welsh farmer against this tractor until his wife managed to disrupt the animal’s path.
The Oregonian farmer was forced to eat his pigs in 2012. After the event, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News channel that although the pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a “shooter”.
“They’re just toys.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
You just have to respect them appropriately,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's Remains Bring Wider Heavy Rainfalls to U.S. Southern Areas
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as she moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will be bringing flooding supplies to northern Mexico and the southern parts of the United States.
Rosa's wind speed was 38 meters per second, or first-class hurricane, on Sunday mornings from the east coast, and it was located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosana is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, which is heading east towards the US west coast. When Rosa arrives in the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to blow deep tropical moisture north towards the US south coast.
Rosa brings up to 250 millimeters of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching low pressure, will form large rain areas for lunch in the coming days.
Locally, 25-100 millimetres of rainfall cause dangerous heavy rain and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfall of 50-75 millimeters per hour in certain landing areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
For certain areas of the South, and especially in Arizona, up to 50-100 millimeters of rain is expected.
Heavy rainfall is possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the decomposition of tropical rain.
When threatening tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the desert on foot.
Heavy rainwaters can turn canyons into streams that flow through the river, and thunderstorms cause local wind gusts and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure area brings local heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfall of more than 10 millimeters is possible, causing small waste streams and landslides.
This would be the first rain in the region.
Distracted tropical rain showers begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, until the rains expand on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesdays and will last for the entire Wednesday.
In October, the United States can see through strong fluctuations in temperatures as the Arctic region cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes large fluctuations in temperature over short distances.
In the middle of the United States, there is an excellent example of large temperature differences on Sundays.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, St. Louis, and Iowan Des Moines is almost 20 degrees.
The late summer heat will once again try to strengthen and expand in the coming days.
From the beginning of October, heat is widely expected in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with temperatures rising to +26 degrees from the southern plains to the eastern parts.
In New York City, the temperature can get worse on Tuesday at +26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than the average.
According to our long-term forecast, the eastern United States has good prospects for average higher temperatures in the first half of October.
Over 20 Million Watched Brett Kavanaugh's Hearing
More than 20 million viewers watched a broadcast on Tuesday of six television channels, in which Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of a sexual crime in the 1980s, gave a swirl of testimony.
At the same time, the political punitive situation continued as television companies suspended their broadcast at the last minute's turn, according to which the FBI is conducting a week-long investigation into the allegations under an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that the late Kavanaugh had caught him and tried to strip him of his clothes at the high school parties.
Kavanaugh, for his part, made an emotional witness statement saying that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
The audience was likely to be more than the 20.4 million that Nielsen announced on Friday.
The company lowered viewers' averages on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels that broadcast the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers who are watching in offices.
Some of the ratios tell us that reading is equivalent to the number of spectators in an American football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the largest audience of all television companies was on the Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination. The channel had an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day’s hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said there were 3.1 million on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN.
After the hearing, the interest was still high.
In the middle of Friday’s drama was Flake.
The CNN and CBS cameras described how the voices of the protesters sent him to the elevator on his way to the hearing of the Judiciary Committee on Friday. The Maltese Republican background team had previously announced his vote on behalf of Kavanaugh.
CNN showed directly how he stood in the minute shop looking down on the plane.
"I'm sitting right in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you believe that he is telling the truth to the people?
“You have power when so many women are powerless,” she was told.
Flake said his office gave an opinion and added before the elevators were closed that he would have more to tell after the committee heard.
Hours later, cable and broadcasting networks were sent directly when the Judiciary Committee began to vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination for the Senate.
However, Flake said it would only work on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges brought against the candidate next week, as demanded by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake convinced himself as part of the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after discussions with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
Britain’s Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit politics
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accuses people critical of her EU divergent plans for politicisation, which threatens Britain’s future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In addition to May’s interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May’s so-called Chequers plan. Johnson is calling for a proposal that Britain and the EU would “improve mutual imports”.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting a 20-year-old Wayde Sims who played basketball in LSU.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, and is charged with second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of an investigation between Sims and Simpson, in which police say Sims lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, WAFB said.
Police say Simpson confessed to Wayde's shooting in the interrogations.
According to the journal Advocate, he was guaranteed $350,000 in U.S. dollars.
An East Baton Rouge County death row investigator released a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Strike Team, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for assisting with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU’s Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement authorities for their “renewal and enforcement of the law”.
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-meter-long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning he was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You always get something like this to happen," Wayde said.
The volcano is melting ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, Mexico’s Disaster Prevention Center urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as the crater’s activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash explosions were recorded during the day.
The center registers the jitters and shakes several times.
On social media, images were published in which residential areas such as Mexico City’s Xochimilco covered the windscreens of cars with a thin ash layer.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, 72 kilometers from the capital to the south, after Mexico was treated by the 7.1-magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan paratroopers gather before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona on Saturday, six people were arrested in a rally between pro-independence protesters and melakka police, and thousands took part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the split.
The police detained a group of masked supporters of independence, who threw the police in the mud and powder paint, which formed dark dust clouds normally on the streets filled with tourists.
Over the course of the day, more snoring broke out as police used their pumps to control the mosquitoes.
Convergences between the supporters of independence and the groups of the Unionists continued for several hours, shouting the former "not to forget, not to forgive" and the latter "to live in Spain".
The local press reports that about a quarter of the people who received treatment for minor injuries received in demonstrations.
The tension is still on the surface in an area that is self-governing one year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal, but which Catalan paratroopers celebrate.
Voters chose independence by a clear majority, although the participation was a low-stakes boycott of the opposition vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence-supporting groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police force.
However, the rally was held, but it had to go on a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist rally with his wife, said there was no longer any hope for Catalonia’s independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.”
I saw my parents crying out for joy in being able to vote, but now we’re stuck in their seats,” he says.
In spite of the vital gains achieved in the regional elections last December, the pace of parties in favour of Catalonia's independence has declined this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are on a voluntary leave of absence or in detention, waiting for a trial to take place.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who described the police’s favorable response on her phone, says politicians on both sides of the dispute.
“The situation is getting worse all the time,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders who had been incarcerated for nine years, announced his participation in next year’s European parliamentary elections.
“Adoption as a European candidate is the best way to condemn the fragmentation and fragmentation of democratic values that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash into house
At the age of 33, 34 and 39, the men were arrested after the car was reported to have repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The events took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
Crime Commissioner Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
We were sent to the car somewhere along the way to shoot with a rifle.
Livingston won Rangers 1-0 with Mengan
Dolly Mengan's first goal in Livingston to secure a win
Livingston surprised Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox team.
Dolly Mengan's goal was eventually enough to win Gary Holt's team in a split second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew missed the first win of the season in the Premiership, followed by a meeting next Sunday with Head of the series, Hearts, who is eight points ahead.
The Rangers will meet in the Rapid Wien European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his lossless streak to six games in the series, and Holt has not lost a single time since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost places on the lack of blades to suffer visitors
Holt's team should have been leading long before his goal, after causing the Rangers some bad problems with his straight line.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and then Alan Lithgow was able to slip into Craig Halkett's blow job on the field, but steered the ball past.
The hosts were popularly handing over ball management to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate from special circumstances.
This is how an important goal came about.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Menga, from which he was able to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
Rangers had held the ball by then, but said the home team would hold the defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely able to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow drove the ball past another special situation in Livingston.
Concentrations in Livingston's penalty area were continuously cleared out, and two of the situations required an unnecessary penalty kick - Halkett's tackled alternator Glenn Middleton and the ball he hit in the hand.
"Beautiful performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont with Tony Macaroni
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent for every player, continuing through the ups and downs.
The team's playing style and crew have hardly changed since it rose back to the highest level of the series.However, Holt has to give credit for the way he has strengthened the team once he has reached the top level.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in leading an excellently organized defense, while Mengan held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the game.
The Rangers had no ideas.
The team has performed very well from time to time under Gerrard, but has now stayed away from his demanding role.
The last feed was left empty, and they managed to open the home team's defense only once, which should serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are the centerpiece of the roster.
Erdogan received a varied reception in Cologne
The smile was bright and the sky blue on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, and the purpose of the trip is to repair relations with NATO allies.
There have been differences between human rights and freedom of the press and Turkey’s EU aspirations.
Erdogan continued his trip to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police prevented the 25,000-strong support group from rallying in front of the mosque, canceling the matter for security reasons, but still gathered a lot of supporters to see the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of whom were Kurds, also voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to call him back.
Competing demonstrations reflect the distribution of opinions, and some of the Turkish people in Germany greet him as a hero when others see him as a self-governing figure.
Accident in Deptford: Biker dies in collision with car
The cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred around 10 a.m. local time in Deptford's south-east near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street with busy traffic.
The driver of the car stopped and the care staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from the accident site on Saturday.
The city police say they are trying to identify the man and inform his loved ones.
There are roadblocks on the site and bus traffic is directed elsewhere. Motorists are urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Trouble
Prison officials report that six inmates have been injured in high-security conditions in the prison's unrest.
The riots began at HMP Long Lart Prison in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, and continue.
Tornado special police officers have been brought to the scene to calm the unrest, behind which there are eight prisoners in a prison cell.
The police's minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison informant said: "HMP Long Lartin has been sent to the prison to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken care of by the police and they may have to spend more time behind the scenes.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lart prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The prison manager was reported to have been hospitalized in June after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In addition, in October, police officers were alerted to the prison due to serious unrest, in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of heavy rain to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical low pressures rarely arrive in Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s happening at the beginning of next week, when Hurricane Rosa’s remnants move across the lunch pond, bringing with it the risk of being crushed.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy rain on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, which will be in the form of rain on Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix noted in its tweet that "only ten tropical storms have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure state 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane another 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50-100 millimetres of rain. With the Mogollin hurricane in Arizona, it can rain anywhere up to 150 millimetres.
In other areas of the lunch pond, including the central mountains and the Great Basin, there are likely to be 25-50 milliliters. The place can rain up to 100 millimetres in total.
The rain of the rose can also be a blessing of drought by trying out the area if there is no risk of heavy rain.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rains can be beneficial because of the severe drought in the south-east.
According to the U.S. Drought Agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second-highest in the world, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa is making a landfall on her route first in the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa's location is 620 kilometers south of Mexico's Punta Eugenia. It is still the hurricane's strong wind speed at 135 kilometers per hour. It moves north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its power when it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico as a strong tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rainfall can be severe and cause a significant flood risk.
“We expect 75-150 millimetres from the California Peninsula to Sonora, and up to 250 millimetres is possible,” says weather.com.
Rosa will then continue her journey across Mexico in a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in a tropical low pressure on Tuesday mornings, from there she will continue her journey across Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday late.
“The greatest risks to the rose or its remains are due to heavy rains in the California Peninsula, North Sonora, and the U.S. South Pacific,” the National Hurricane Agency said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rains and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton's Attack: Four Arrested for Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning from four in the UK.
He was taken to a hospital where he is said to be in a "stable" state.
Police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
The police will ask for contact from anyone who may have video footage of the events recorded on the mobile phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh's Experienced Democratic Party "Deep and Furious"
“On behalf of Judge Kavanaugh, there is a voice against the unscrupulous and disgraceful methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from the Democratic Party's "morning and suffocation" throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday that he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation of sexual harassment that would have occurred decades ago in their teens.
Ford also testified in the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character, and courage" on that day.
"For the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh's appointment today, the vote is one of the most deserving legal scholars of our time, with excellent merit in public service," he told the West Virginia Support Team.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican voting in the polls.
“We are five weeks from the most important election in our lifetime.
Not just campaigning, but campaigning in full,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to fight for excellent candidates.”
Trump called the Democrats “oppression and deterrence.”
A senior assistant to the Republican Party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in Kavanaugh’s nomination process is expected in the Senate by no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, the death toll is expected to rise
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed in an earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, many of whom were washed away along with huge waves hitting the shores.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on Friday at the city’s beach, when waves as high as six meters high hit the beach in the dark of night, and many cried out at the destruction of the waves.
The tsunami was caused by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, when they were the victims of it,” said Purwo Nugroho Jakarta, a BNPB disaster relief agency.
“The tsunami did not come alone, but it took cars, logs, houses and struck everywhere on the ground,” Nugroho says, adding that the tsunami reached an open sea speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some of the people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palus.
The aerial images published by the Disaster Response Agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to resurrect the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) issued a statement saying that the energy released in a major earthquake on Friday corresponded to about 200 atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
It says that the landscape of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could trigger a tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as “wide” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He told about the ruins of some of the bodies of the victims that had been found and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and damage could be greater than 300 kilometers from the Palu to the northern continuous coast, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the collision.
The communications connections "are completely gone, and no information has been received from Donggaga," Nugroho said.
According to the statement issued by the Red Cross, there are more than 300,000 people living there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not telling the tsunami hit the Return, but the authorities said it had received a warning at the time of the wave.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of the building is shouting out with excitement warnings about the approaching tsunami for people on the street.
Only minutes later, a water wall hits the beach, which takes past buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large power outage that would cut off communications connections around Asku, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities say the army has begun to send aid from Jakarta and other cities on transports, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic supplies.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for support activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
The situation is really bad.
The staff of World Vision’s Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where they are housed in tents in the interior of the office. On their way they passed the scene of destruction, Doseb says.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is really bad.
When the aid groups began their uncomfortable task, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to the country.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, equipment and personnel from abroad can only begin to flow once the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
“This is still a provincial-level disaster,” said Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Arriani.
“Once the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start receiving international help, but the announcement has not yet been made.”
When the second night came after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family members who were missing were living up to the hope that the trade of their loved ones would deviate from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was picked up from the dumpster.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in the rubble for two days beside her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian contingent, had trained two missing dependents for the Asian skis that ended earlier this month.
The Roa Roa hotel also injured its students, Mandagi says.
“As a senior member of the alliance, I have my own emotional back,” he says.
Gendon says he has been desperately trying to reach out to contestants at the Beach Festival via WhatsApp messages after news of the Roa Roa hotel’s sorting spread among the community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one gray sign appeared instead of two blue ones.
"It means to me that messages were not sent," he says.
The thieves took $26,750 in addition to the ATM in Newport on the Levee
The thieves took $26,750 from a Brink's security guard employee on Friday morning when he was completing the ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department report.
The driver of the car had been emptying and supplementing the ATM located in the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
When Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, "he ran after his husband", who also stole his intended money.
According to the report, the eyewitnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
Individuals who have information about their identity are asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper to be renamed Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A character formerly known as Kanye West".
Ye has been West's favorite name for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album, released in June.
The change precedes his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album called Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the show's creator, canceled her participation for "sensual reasons".
West has previously said that the word also has a religious significance for him, in addition to being a abbreviation of his professional name.
Talking about the album's name earlier this year with radio presenter Big Boy, West said, "I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is 'you.'
“I am you, me, and all of us.
It began with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended with a shorter form of Ye, which only manifests the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album is mostly a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his favorite names Love and Brother Love.
Also West’s former partner, JAY-Z, has occasionally removed and returned the lines of correspondence and big letters.
Mexico's AMLO says it will not use an army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians. The announcement came as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the massacre of students.
Lopez Obrador, who performed at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, said he would "never use an army to defeat the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the armed forces launched a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people during a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young people in Mexico by offering monthly study support and by opening more free public universities.
He said to the young gangs of criminals who were driving the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities.
Diplomas should double their funding for artificial intelligence research (AI)
The U.S. should double the funding it uses to research artificial intelligence as China makes its industry more efficient, says Google, Microsoft and Apple-based financier and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee.
The opinion was preceded by reports on the artificial intelligence of the various parts of the United States administration, even though the United States lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan as early as last year: it aims to become the leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that there are so many other countries left behind in the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood of the next significant artificial intelligence acquisition being made in the United States, Lee said in a CNBC interview this week.
Lee’s book “The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month through Houghton Mifflin’s Harcourt publishing house. He is working as CEO at Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most important artificial intelligence+ companies.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that ended up being the highest ranked Othello player in the United States, and later served as the head of Microsoft Research and the head of Google's China operations.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. administration's previous technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and the Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. researchers have been working hard to get public funding.
“Academic influencers are not driven by China, but by big companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up its artificial intelligence efforts.
“I believe that those who have completed an artificial intelligence doctoral degree should automatically be granted green cards,” he said.
The Chinese Council of State plans for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other state organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is poorer, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Defense Department’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together partners from industry and academia. The White House has also announced the formation of an artificial intelligence special committee.
DARPA also announced this month a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
NSF invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative to set up the National Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not progressed in months.
Macedonian people in the referendum on changing the name of the country
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
In the opinion of Greece, which owns the province of Macedonia, the name of the northern neighbour is in practice a territorial requirement of its territory, and has therefore opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries agreed on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents said the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the voting activity will reach the required limit of 50 per cent to make the result legal.
The question in the ballot box was: “Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership in the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaevi, argue that the price is worth paying to ensure that Macedonia, which has risen from the collapse of Yugoslavia, can seek to be a member of both the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive impact.
The amendment requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Board, no irregularities were reported by 1 p.m.
However, voting activity was only 16 compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, with 66 per cent of eligible voters finally voting.
“I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted for the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's name change in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The name change would pave the way for NATO and EU membership .
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set chairs in front of the tents erected by the boycotters in front of the Skopje Parliament.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the ends in a standing position, not through the door of the kitchen,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, as part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says the NATO membership will bring the required investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe in a major majority vote for a change of name because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said in a statement.
He said "yes" to the sound of our "explosive future".
The opinion poll published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute on Monday referred to 30-43% of the voting activity in the referendum - i.e. less required activity.
In a second poll conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they voted in favour of a “yes” option.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the voting activity must exceed 50 per cent by a single vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the Western government when it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beat Brighton's entire defense by goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear impression on Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero scored a goal in 65 minutes to make it look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the drawing, an Argentine top player was knocked out of the middle field.
He found an empty space in the field by shoving three Brighton defenders through.
Then Aguero noticed that he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender and then left several others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
After that, he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English batsman used his first touch inside the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton guard Mathew Ryan's goal in a right angle shot.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that “Aguero has problems with his feet.”
"We said he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have him at that time.”
However, Sterling had already given the sky blue an advantage in the election campaign.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in the deep Brighton area.
He gave Leroy San a beautiful pass on the left side.
Sane took a few touch before sending the ball to the back of the ball towards Sterling.
The Sky Blues striker knocked the ball into the net just before the finish line.
City will meet the Hoffenheim Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 am at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a cheerleader in a game against the Rockies
Nationals is out of the drop-off playoffs, so why try to make the most of the starting line-up?
However, Scherzer always hopes to take the lead in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a downside. They have one win in the Los Angeles Dodgers Western series.
The Rockies caught at least a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
“Even though we don’t have a stake, we can at least rise to the challenge knowing that the atmosphere created by the audience and the other team here in Denver is creating the most demanding competitive situation for me that I have faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take the challenge?”
The Nationals have not yet released their starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a chance in these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a practice session on Thursday, playing 34 at the start of his game and feeding on Sunday with his normal rest period.
Washington's right-handed player has an 18-7 win/lose ratio this season, with an ERA score of 2.53 and a batting average of 300 times, with a ratio of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigning in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking on the importance of Republican voting in the polls.
“All of our achievements are at stake in November.
We are five weeks from the most important election in our lifetime.
This is one of the really big -- not just campaigns, but campaigns in full, and that's why I'm running everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
They have decided to return to power by any means, and you can see their malice and their malice.
They do not choose whom they will harm or whom they will have to shoot in order to gain power; that is what they want, power and power, but we do not give it to them.”
He said the Democrats had taken up the task of “oppression and deterrence.”
“And it’s been visible over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and evil and evil and false.”
When referring to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-serving Democratic Senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the audience responded with loud applause.
“Do you remember his answer?
You're leaking the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Well, well, I'm waiting a bit -- it was really bad for body language -- for the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinion
I wasn’t actually surprised when my local party’s Momentum activists supported a statement of mistrust against me.
At the very least, I am only the last Labour representative to be told that I am not welcome - just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary group, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the statement of distrust was critical of the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, on Europe, it is ironic that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders on similar issues.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference said on Friday that “we want our meetings to be participatory and productive”.
Most of the eight years that I have served as Labour's local representative have been exactly the same as the Fridays of the Party Council.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone of voice, and a "friendly and gentler" policy has long since been forgotten if it never even began.
It is all the more clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates divergent opinions, and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether or not it is suitable for party leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became the leader, and my colleagues, with whom I had thought I had shared a similar political view, began to expect me to be fully involved and to take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to, whether it was a national security or an EU internal market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is a crowd of insults on social media that demands the cancellation of my choice, the rejection of central politics and I hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I make are at least political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face daily sexual and racist insults, and who never complain.
The normalization of coal treatment is one of the most disturbing features of the politics of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called on the Labour Party to embrace a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every expression of distrust or change of choice, the party will only become more limited.
For two years I have been encouraged to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that “everything goes well”.
But that’s not why I went to politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the failure of the Thatcher government to attend a single school, I have tried to promote better public services for those who need them most, both as a city authority and as a minister.
I've never covered my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could have been surprised by my views or my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards a Brexit that is detrimental to households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of separation or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible Ayr on the block
The two last-minute goals slightly distorted the end result of the match, but Ayr undoubtedly earned a day's win in the entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of ten that has not lost a single game.
A great defense and a more successful risk-taking was ultimately what encouraged them, and coach Peter Murchie may well be pleased.
“We’ve been challenged in our games and we’re still undefeated, so I can be happy,” he says.
Melrose's Robyn Christie says, "All honor to Ayr, they took risks better than we did."
Ayr took the lead in 14 minutes with Grant Anderson and Frazier Climon on a successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Roy Hughes, who surrendered to the Warriors match, enabled Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot to score.
Climo raised Ayr's lead in the penalty paint, and just before halftime he made the painting and succeeded in a conversion jump, raising Ayr's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second match well with Patrick Anderson, whose conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
The match was a long delay when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and transported out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr was promoted to the lead by Stafford McDowall, whose conversion kick Climo succeeded.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose's Bruce Colvine made a hard-fought painting, which the conversion escape failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for attacking the ballless Climo, and Macpherson made the painting from behind Ayri's maul, who left the sideline throw.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's kick and dedicated Gregor Henry to finishing the home team's fifth goal.
Still Game series star to start in restaurant industry
The star of the Still Game series, Ford Kieran, has been appointed as the head of the licensed restaurant company and is also starting to work in the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, which he co-wrote with comedian Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth season is the finale of the series, and it seems that Kierna is already planning her life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he has been appointed head of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kierna wanted to join Glasgow’s thriving restaurant business.
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia’s inland state tries to regain access to the Pacific Ocean
Marines were fighting outside the naval base in La Paz.
The flags of public buildings bear a sea blue flag.
Titicacal’s naval bases for the Amazon were punctuated with a slogan: “Justifiably, the sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to get it back.”
With Bolivia remaining inland, the memory of Chile’s lost coastline in the bloody 19th century is still strong – as is the desire to sail the Pacific once again.
The hope is at its highest for decades when Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of reflection.
“Bolivia has a strong sense of progress, a shared spirit and a sense of urgency, and, of course, a positive attitude in the expectation of a final solution,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Several Bolivians across the country are following in hopes of the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screen, hoping that the Hague will – at the end of decades of closed debate – Bolivia’s position that Chile has an obligation to grant the Bolivian sea as its own head.
Bolivia’s charismatic president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election next year, has a lot to play in the lineup next Monday.
"Returning to the Pacific is very close," he assured at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the Court is unlikely to decide in accordance with Bolivia's interests, and even if it did, the situation would hardly change.
The Dutch-backed UN institution does not have the authority to hand over the administrative regions of Chile, and the ICJ has also indicated that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision is given only six months after the last submissions indicate that the case “is not complicated,” says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than furthering Bolivia’s goals.
“The current Bolivian government has taken over the issue of maritime connectivity,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ controversial rhetoric has stifled the rest of Chile’s goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to have discussions at some point, but it is very difficult to organise negotiations after that.
Neither country has had a second embassy since 1962.
The former president and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, does not accept the view that the Court’s decision would have been exceptionally swift.
Monday gives Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end the differences that have lasted 139 years in mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the issue of shipping as political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to connect with the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to understand that it’s time for us to move on from the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can rely on the U.S.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States of the promises made at the Singapore Summit of Heads of State.
Rin's statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is re-starting his diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the U.S. met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was "a distant dream" to believe that continued sanctions and the US resistance to the declaration of the end of the Korean War would bring North Korea back to its knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is on the lookout for approval of the declaration.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pjongjang intended to abandon the arsenal, which the state is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own security, has led to widespread doubt.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Shows showcase the latest model’s large headwear, which is also on your doorstep.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don’t need to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 show a range of special over-the-top headlines that would blur the Paris fashion weeks.
Extremely impractical headlines took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to fashion shows as well.
Valentino’s most eye-catching creation was a beige hat with a wide feather collar, which covered the ends of the models almost completely.
Other oversized accessories included watermelon, walnuts and even pineapple decorated with jewelry – but they aren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of unusual masks – just right before Halloween.
In several colorful masks, lips were sewn, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than the senior.
One creature with a snorkel and a mask resembled more of a diving instrument, and the other resembled a molten ice sheet.
And if you want to take a stand for big fashion, you got lucky.
Fashion followers predict that huge scarves are appearing on the cliff.
The oversized hats follow closely "La Bombaa", a half-metre-long leather shoulder hat that has been seen by all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult image of an impractical hat, which has been widely seen on social media, also targeted the fashion displays of another cocoon creation – an oil-based beach bag that is almost as big as a model wearing it.
The white leather handbag with a burnt orange neckline was the most eye-catching creation of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in the Paris fashion weeks.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large-sized hats and beach bags in the fall next summer – designers have made such a big impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for the world’s citizens
The learning outcomes of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has also continued as a result of good test results in 2018. Success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
These schools, which are located in more than 30,000 different parts of Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), which aim to provide high-quality services to their students and their parents.
The detailed schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen career, postgraduate and higher education, as well as world citizenship.
As an actor in the field of education, who can design and implement customized study content, we have noticed the status of languages as a popular and desired subject in continuing educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to build relationships with people from other countries.
We note from this year's latest test results that languages are at the top of the lists for the pass percentage among private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
The material was collected from 74 schools belonging to SCIS. Based on the data, it was found that of the students who received the best grade A, 72% studied Mandarin Chinese, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are considered to be of the same value as natural science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school curriculum and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Employment Office in 2014, 17 % of the situations in which the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary for the promotion of young people's future career development.
The more possible work assignments require language skills, the more essential these skills are to form in the global world.
If a person has studied a second language, he or she will have an advantage in the future from this life-long art, regardless of the career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner will automatically put a qualified person ahead in the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, more than 4,000 British adults, 75 per cent, are not able to speak a foreign language, and France was the only language with a double-digit figure of 15 per cent.
This is why investing in language learning is now important for today’s children.
In particular, the knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance of finding a decent job.
Within Scotland, schools differ from one another in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are thought to be important to the British in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Despite your child’s interests, there are always a number of language options taught by specialized teachers in detail schools.
Scotland’s private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At this time, it cannot be denied that, in the international business environment, languages will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Today’s languages should indeed be seen as ‘international communication skills’.
The retail schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and a high level of education to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the head of the SCIS of the Scottish Council for Private Schools
LeBron makes his debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait for LeBron James's first appearance at the Los Angeles Lakers line-up is just over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego before the start of the season.
But how many minutes he really plays remains to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48," the Walton Lakers' official website said.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to be playing difficult minutes.
Internships from James were asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers before six games played through.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need any more pre-games to prepare,” he said.
Time of Trump's West Virginia campaign, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five planned election events next week, including consensual targets such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for the vote to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court judge, Trump is seeking to increase support for the upcoming midterms, as Republicans are in danger of losing a majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump’s West Virginia Wheeling event begins at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia campaign event online as a livestream icon via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is taking a stand this week at the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became furious over allegations of sexual harassment that have delayed the Senate’s confirmation vote last week on the FBI’s investigation.
But the primary goal for the campaign series is to support the success of the Republican candidates in the close November elections.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign was commented on by these five events next week with the aim of “awakening voluntary and supportive Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress governance is so essential to his purpose that the president is willing to travel to as many states as possible during an urgent campaign period,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today’s venue is Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and supporters can even arrive from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit during the month in West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is backing Republican West Virginia senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind in the polls.
"For Morrissey, there is no good sign that the president is trying to increase his support for opinion polls," said Simon Haeder, a state scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows willingness to fight to keep hope up before Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon quarterbacks were just what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-empowering power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this.
Where is this power of success with them at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead station that narrowed down to four, so we're taking this as a leap of success," Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage: four points above and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, experience that they have a bit of wind in the sails and a lot of encouragement, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play all day together and get three points out of four.
Spieth has been an over-emphasis on the green line, and leads by example.
The cheers of the winning party intensified as he advanced his lap, when he succeeded in the critical pit to level the game level four, when he and Thomas were two points behind two holes.
The pit they won in the 15th game was followed by a similar cry, which gave the impression that he believes that the United States team has not yet lost.
“You have to focus really well and just take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players have left.
18 must make an impact.
The only players who have gained more points since Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup undisputed legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special, but affectionate twin has won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't do any boogies on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided boogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way in which they give and receive energy from this vicious audience, confirms that they are the pre-favorite on Sunday. And when the sun goes down at Le Golf National, another more popular player to ensure Europe’s possible victory could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I prefer both at the same time in different threads.
The talks on the success of Europe are, however, premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly defeated by Alex Noren, who was paired with Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the morning four-game.
One bog and two double bogs on the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedes so deep that they weren’t even close to surviving there.
But on Sunday, no one will help you get out of this mess.
Four-ball and four-ball are exciting to watch from a couple’s perspective: what kind of advice they give or leave without, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a considerable leadership position before the last day, but this quarter-final showed that the United States team has the will to fight, even though it is suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes 10-6 lead before the last days of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in a good lead before the last days of the Ryder Cup after they took 10-6 lead positions from the United States in four-ball and four-games on Saturday.
Brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the win with two wins from the creepy Tiger Woods, and scored a high four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who struggled hard to maintain a win at Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the weakly played U.S. team in the morning four-ball lead to a 3-1 game.
The United States were a tougher opponent in four games winning two games, but they were unable to narrow down the lead.
Jim Fury's half needed eight points from Sunday's 12th doubles game to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to have won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called together as "Molliwood", were the second pair in Ryder Cup history to have won four points in the first four games.
After scoring first in four-ball games with Woods and Patrick Reed, they then finished in an over-the-top draw against Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau 5-4 even more vigorously.
Woods, who barely survived two games on Saturday, was occasionally very brilliant, but has nevertheless lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-game, and even seven in a row.
Justin Rose took a break from the morning qualifiers, but returned to the qualifiers with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are in the rankings first and third.
Europe did not get everything in the way it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the U.S. at two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarter-finals, and later a 4-3 win over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the quarterfinals after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has risen four points from the back-to-back level at the start of the doubles, although on Furyk's side the balance game is enough to keep the win.
However, after two days of being second best, it may be that on Sunday the counterattack is too much to ask for.
North Korea ‘not in any way’ to rid itself of weapons without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased distrust of the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant voluntary measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, breaking the test site of nuclear tests, and promising that North Korea will not increase nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons.
“However, we have not seen a similar organism from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so in such circumstances, getting rid of ourselves unilaterally is not possible.”
While Mr Ri reiterated the well-known complaint that Washington does not accept the gradual abandonment of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for each intermediate period, his statement is nevertheless significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament has not been completely shut down, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the co-ordination given by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first sitting of the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12. In a statement, Kim assured "the Korean Peninsula's nuclear disarmament" and Trump promised to secure North Korea.
North Korea has sought to formally end the 1950s–1953 Korean War, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of tight international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. demands ‘one-arms removal first,’ and has raised pressure with the help of sanctions to achieve its goal by force – even opposing the ‘peace declaration’,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions would get us to our knees is an indifferent wish.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are only deepening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party demanding the elimination of weapons were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such a dead end."
Yet Rin’s tone of voice was markedly different from last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that directing missiles toward the U.S. was inevitable after “bad president” Trump called Kim a “missile man equipped with suicide targets.”
Even last year, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea. However, this year, Trump urged Kim to yearn for this courage to approach the abandonment of weapons, but still stressed that much work remains to be done and the sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is created.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn’t have a time limit: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia submitted that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the progress already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the strengthening of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue as strong and unsuccessful until we prove full, final and reaffirmed.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of cracking down on Pyongyang's funding channels for the production of ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Pompeo met with North Korea at the UN General Assembly, and announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go unhesitatingly.
When he left Pyongyang, he described progress, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster demands" only a few hours later.
North Korea pledged to close down a missile base and a nuclear facility with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States is taking “responsive measures”.
According to Pompeo, Kim means “responsible measures” of security that Trump pledged to meet in Singapore, and a shift towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students carry out a sufficient rest-directed course
All undergraduate students at Harvard University will take part in this year’s course aimed at increasing students’ rest. The course is a counter to the university’s thriving macho culture, where students weigh long nights with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students of the world’s best university are often quite unaware of basic issues related to their own well-being.
The course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard University, who works in a sleep study at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for a course after he lectured on the influence of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing about this now, my last year of study?’
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I think was surprising,” he told the Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how the right sleeping habits support academic and athletic performance as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor at Harvard University’s School of Medicine and vice president of health services, says the university has completed a course after hearing how students suffer from severe sleep apnea during a week of study.
The hour-long course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented with a picture of the living room, where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus get information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effect of sleeping clothes on sports performances and regular evening performances.
The second section tells participants about how long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
With interactive icons, the campus map encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this has no direct impact on the behavior of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these things in exactly the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking,” Professor Czeisler added.
All night long student marathons are still a matter of pride, according to Professor Czeisler, and the ever-growing pressures of modern technology and students created a growing problem of sleep deprivation.
“Getting enough and high-quality sleep should be a student’s ‘secret weapon’ against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against weight gain, because sleepiness causes a brain-like state of starvation, which makes a person constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he had taken part in one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
He tells the course he opened his eyes and gave the incision to all the students of the campus to organize a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all graduate students will be able to complete a similar course of study before moving on to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set the alarm clock to remind them of the time spent in bed in addition to waking up in the morning, and urges them to keep in mind the adverse effects caused by electronic display devices and LED lighting on the “blue light” of the day from the frequency of the pain.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengan shot to win by Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers once again experienced a new losing day when Dolly Mengan's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1–0 win.
Ibrox players were looking for their first win since February 4–1, which was played against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team took the win this time, and Gerrard now only experienced his second loss during his 18-game manager career. Rangers scored eight points from this pick.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before halftime, and with Rangers' fallen battle goal, the situation was no longer leveled after that.
The Rangers fell to 6th place as a result of the game, but Livingston has climbed to 3rd place and only Hibernia are in the top draw.
The Rangers may have other problems as Calum Spence was injured during the game when he hit an object thrown from the visitor's head and has had to deal with the wound.
Gerrard made eight changes to the composition with which the team had beaten Ayr and progressed to the Scottish League Cup semifinals.
Holt continued with the Livi 11 line-up, with which the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again yielded results when a well-built line-up managed to defeat the opponent in almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate the ball's possession, Livingston was better off using the situation for his own advantage.
Livingston had the opportunity to score in just two minutes, when Mengan's first innings gave Scott Pittman a free kick for Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender Alan Lithgow managed to only score wide in the back.
Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but in the final third of the game, there was no more self-confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when, at the fifteenth minute, he and Steven Lawless had collided, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but Liam Kelly, a former Ibrox goalkeeper, refused to allow Lassana Coulibaly's box and Ovie Ejaria's impotent shot.
Livingston's 34-minute goal was an unexpected opening, but it wasn't just because of the team's hard work.
The Rangers could still do nothing about Jacobs' long-running feeding tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who coldly brought the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
Gerrard decided to replace Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The exchange affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack interrupted Kelly's impact on the fast defense.
Livingston put the visitors to play their own game again, as Lithgow and Halkett continued to eat long after each other.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their lead at the last minute of the game, but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs from getting to the corner before Lithgow could get to his position.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton also demanded a penalty kick after joining Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanakka: Geigermeter inventor
Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany on September 30, 1882, in Germany, 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a device known as a geigermeter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and also the central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado Clocks", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans present quite impressive scientists from cattle farms:
Man: "What kind of miracle is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geigermeter. It's used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put your headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the impact of radioactive radiation on minerals.”
Evans: "Look, now it's really radiating!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ several typical proteins that are eaten
The vaccine has given promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, the cancer cells of a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months of being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the typical HER2 proteins that several people eat. The transformed cells are eventually injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, USA, describes the method: “Based on our results, this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "guides the growth of several types of cancers," explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer and cancers of the ovaries, lungs and colon."
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was caught in the teeth of criticism after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The show didn't go according to plan
Kanye West got his nose soaked in the Saturday Night Live entertainment program after bragging about President Donald Trump’s flamboyant style and announcing his bid to run for president in the 2020 election.
In the wake of Trump's "Ghost Town" third song, "Make America Great Again", West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“When I talk to a white man often, they ask me how I can support Trump because he’s a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America long ago,” he said.
Tonight's broadcast began with a sketch in which Matt Damon was angry at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing on the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearing relates to the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford about Kavanaugh's sexual harassment.
West’s plot was not featured in the live broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it to interrupted social media.
It's unclear if Rock's intent is to make a joke about West in his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he was badly treated in the background because of the hat he held in his head.
"I was teased behind the scenes.
I was told not to go to the stage with this hat in my head.
I'm being bullied!
Then they still say I’m marginal,” West said in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see what it means to be marginalized?" and says he's dressed up in a Steel Man reference, because "then you can't dictate what I'm doing.
“Try with love.”
According to the variation, West's comments smothered the audience at least twice, and the show's performers seemed embarrassed. One of those present described the situation in the magazine as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was selected to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by presenting the song "I love it" in a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA organization, Candace Turner, who praised this courage on Twitter: “WITH THEY HAVE BEEN HUNGRYFUL.”
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West “is just herself, which is once and for all wonderful.”
“I can, however, decide to BE a FOREVER person (by buying this music or clothing or by supporting this ‘art’), which I consider to be a harmful ideology for my community to support and spread.
He's a free man.
The same applies to us,” he added.
Earlier in the evening, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "a person formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The second rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the previous music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later became an artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast's restaurant barrister gets accused of murder
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after he was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in the Ballyhackamore area.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belgian court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Actor Kit Harington, who plays the role of the throne, faces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding hero role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series The Kingdom Game.
Harrington, however, has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero: according to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned by hard work.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Cultural Association, Harrington suspects that “someone has gone wrong” in the matter and questions the means in use to interfere with toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Harrington, also married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who is also a member of the Empire State Games star card, admits that she has a strong desire to get involved.
“The question of where we’ve gone wrong with masculinity is going to arouse strong feelings in me right now,” he says.
"What have men been taught in the years of their growth that have led to the problems that are now noticeable?"
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how can we change this?
There’s something really wrong with young men.”
He also admits that he would not be involved in the production of the front or rear parts of the game after the series ends next summer, as he has, in his own words, "received enough combatants and horses".
In November, Harrington is seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of the film producer and his brother-in-law.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife, Rose, was the best thing the Kingdom Hall has ever offered him.
“I met my wife on this show, so it kind of gave me my family and my life from there,” he says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow's play Harrington in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 to Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens with HIV-positive and AIDS.
According to health authorities, the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A clear majority of new cases have been mediated through sex, which means a shift to previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the conference held in Yunnan Province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of people with HIV and those with AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
Sex-related HIV infections are an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90% of men who engage in sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of these diseases are caused by insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to ensure the universal availability of HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee's leaked Republican senator's information and accuses of spreading "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. House member Maxine Waters denied allegations that her staff members had published personal information about the three Republican senators on Wikipedia’s pages about them.
A Los Angeles-based Democrat said the allegations were spread by "extreme right-wing" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more demeaning lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the published data are the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, and Senators from Utah, Mike Lee, and Orrin Hatch.
An unknown person released the information from the U.S. Congress on Thursday during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundits and RedState reported that, according to Hillin’s newspaper, messages were published from the IP address attached to the Waters office and from a person belonging to the Waters staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and it is an absolute lie,” Water continued.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and false accusations, is not in any way responsible for leaking this data.
This baseless accusation is completely false and absolutely a lie.”
Waters’s statement quickly received criticism online, and critics were also joined by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he's arguing this is very hostile," Fleischer wrote.
"It seems that his character does not suit a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to act hostilely.
There's no reason to be stupid.
There is no reason to question the defendant’s motives.
In such a situation, it is necessary to behave moderately and calmly."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is contesting Waters's place in Congress’s polls, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's unbelievable if this is true," he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that it had contacted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies as a result of these fraudulent allegations.
“We ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” he continued, “and that they are brought to legal responsibility for all destructive and dangerous actions directed at some or all of my staff members.”
Johnny English Strikes Again – Underpowered Rowan Atkinson Agent Parody
It is already a well established tradition to look for Brexit references from any little-known film about Britain. However, this does not appear to fit Johnny English’s agent parody and action comedy series, which began in 2003 on the Johnny English scene.
Can the language of the nation’s satirical past become Britain’s new national export success?
Either way, the muddy, cumbersome and incompetent Johnny English has already earned his promise to replay. Already his name tells above all that it is a comic creation that is aimed at the foreign film market of the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, about the thieving secret agent who desperately tries to breathe the glamor around him, but appears to be a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and the unfortunate one-shot musician at the London 2012 opening concert.
At the heart of the character has been left behind by a cosmopolit and a mysterious world man, whom Atkinson originally presented in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last show has its moments, yes.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades squeak in his helmet.
Atkinson’s physical comedy presents, but humor itself seems inefficient and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ film brands, such as 007 and Dangerous Mission, now offer humor as part of the film’s core content.
Humor seems to be directed at children, and Johnny English's mischievous treatment does not seem to me as inventive and sharp as Atkinson's Mr. Bean's comic book.
The fact that Britain is in a worse position every year is a recurring starting point.
Cyber Hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network and exposes the identities of all British agents in the field to the blackmail of an agent on duty – portrayed as Kevin Eldon’s unfortunate little role-play.
This is the last drop to the important and superficial prime minister, who is already in the grip of political dissatisfaction with his ears: Emma Thompson is doing everything in the face of the Teresa May parody, but the script just doesn’t give him enough room.
When the intelligence advisors inform him that all spies on the field have been exposed, he or she may have to call someone who has already moved away from active service.
Of course, this is a captivating Johnny English in his own person. He spends his holidays as a fine school teacher, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the discipline of the noble art. The topic is to cheer up some delicate jokes; English keeps the School of Rock-type lessons informed.
English is hailed for an emergency meeting at the Whitehall, where she meets again with her never-ending, patient fighting partner Bough, who is still portrayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, whose role as Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to have access to his rights.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to his majesty's secret service to face the fateful super-crime Ophelia Bhuletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough’s odyssey turns into a farce in the same way: a waitress masked twin sets a fine French restaurant on fire and sparks chaos as she tries to hide Volta’s luxury yacht. The venture to get to know Volta’s house with virtual glasses will end up cleaning up.
Even the last hurdles of the actors will come to an end, but despite all the impoverishment and attraction, the film still feels a little made for the children’s audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
When I first saw Johnny English films, I’ve come to the same conclusion: why can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
Britain's Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week at five-day wage
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, thinks of a radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but pay for five days.
The party is reported to require business leaders to transfer the savings generated by the artificial revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend at the same wage.
According to sources, the idea ‘would’ fit in with the party’s economic programme and its plans to impose policies for the benefit of the workers.
The Trade Unions Central Organisation supports the transition to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A source for the high-level Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "I reported on the revision of the line before the turn of the year.
The change will not happen in an instant, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first person to support the idea: The Green Party of the United Kingdom pledged to support the transition to a four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, this objective does not receive undivided support in the Labour lines.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party's line-up, and the party does not consider such a move."
John McDonnell, Minister of State for Treasury, took advantage of last week's work conference to present his vision for the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from "faceless dictators" and from "entrepreneurs" of utility companies.
According to the plans of the Ministry of Finance of the shadow government, the current shareholders of the water companies would not be able to recover their share in full, as the Labour-led government could carry out "decreases" on the basis of perceived abuses.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on the boards of directors of companies and create inclusive equity funds, which would allow 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to be transferred to the management of employees. According to the plan, 500 individual employees would be paid in pounds every year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss 60 minutes on a 60-minute program about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The investigation into the charges against FBI judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week's final vote on Kavanaugh's appointment as a Supreme Court judge. The delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine some Republican nominees.
During the 60-minute program on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the program’s correspondent, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it would be possible for the FBI to find out things they could change their minds about.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said by the time I got to the hearing... I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the charges came up, and I asked him, 'Did you do that?'
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like a rock.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's a bombardment," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett argued it out loud,” Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one of the people he named could confirm this.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don’t see what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
Saturday’s Global Citizen Festival in New York City is a music event with a performance map as impressive as its mission: eradicating poverty from the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival is attracting tens of thousands of people to New York City’s Central Park lawns to listen to performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make the event a well-known real destination: the eradication of extreme poverty in 20 years.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively working to eradicate poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to an event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or "works", such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision-maker or calling a call, or performing any other project with the knowledge of the art of doing.
But how has the Global Citizen succeeded, now that there is still 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one “clickivism” among others – the idea that the world can be changed by signing up for an email address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announces that it has written more than 19 million books on behalf of various goals since 2011.
According to him, these actions have encouraged political decision-makers to report on commitments and principles amounting to more than $37 billion and that have been used in a way that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements, based on which more than $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds achieved have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
The main commitments of the Global Fund include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives operating in the UK, which is committed to "helping children's development to their full potential". The Group committed to delivering to Rwanda $ 35 million in funding for this subcontracting
“Thanks to the UK government, donors, governments of different countries, and just like you, global citizens, we can bring social injustice and malnutrition to the pages of history,” Power of Nutrition’s Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the group, the UK government was also called on to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by more than 5,000 labour force. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which is focused on combating malnutrition, reaching 5 million mothers and children.
One of the most frequently asked questions on the movement’s website is, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
A global citizen’s answer: “The road will be long and difficult and there will be many impact stones in front of us.
However, we will succeed, like the great civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.”
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will be playing a New York concert this year, and its main characters include artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e.
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the country can make energy exports more difficult by using the navy as a "strategic"
According to Ryan Zink, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior for the Washington Examiner, Washington can "if necessary" rely on its fleet to help prevent the spread of Russian energy in the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s activity in Syria – at the invitation of the legitimate government – is an excuse for the recognition of new energy markets in the region.
“I believe that [Russia’s] reason for presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just like in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe,” Zinken said.
According to the current holder, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
“The United States has the ability to keep the shipping lanes open with its fleet and, if necessary, by insuring that the energy they provide does not end up on the world market,” he says.
Zinke spoke to the audience about the event organized by the Energy Consumers’ Union, a non-profit group that is profiled as the “Voice Tower of Energy Consumers” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it is one and the same thing.
“The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is more or less artificial, and the replacement of fuel by another,” he says, describing Russia as a “one-tempo circus number” whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements are timed to a situation where the Trump administration has sought to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace it with significantly cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
To make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “irreconcilable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which President Trump said is binding on Berlin’s capture youth.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transfer capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres of the pipeline in use, to be a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington’s opposition, and considers it an example of unhealthy competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after taking over the U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has sparked a backlash in Germany, which has strengthened its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industrial umbrella organisation, the German Industrial Union, has urged the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it very problematic that a third country interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, the head of the German industrial union, said recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, plans to think carefully about “setting the term in the 2020 presidential election”
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she was "carefully considering" becoming a presidential candidate after the midterms.
Warren confirmed that he was considering his candidacy at an open-ended interview in Holoyok, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to move to Washington and correct our mismanagement, and that also means women at the head of the kingdom,” she told The Hill.
"After the sixth day of November, I will carefully consider the appointment of a presidential candidate."
Warren, on the other hand, criticized President Donald Trump on the occasion, saying that “he’s taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has appeared as a direct critic of Trump and the Supreme Court's candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, “We must really need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, according to an opinion poll published Thursday, the majority of Warren voters do not support this provision in 2020.
According to a study by the University of Suffolk Policy Research Institute and the Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts do not support the senator's appointment.
32% voted in favour of being nominated.
Several of the respondents supported the appointment of former governor Deval Patrick with a 38% share, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates for the 2020 election, for example, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden has said he will officially decide on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin refers her son to war trauma at Donald Trump’s election rally
Sarah Palin’s son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and was charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son has to go through when he gets home, I can very well relate to other families who have to face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our soldiers bring back home,” he told an audience meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest ‘a power horse in the living room’ and said his son, like other war veterans, “come home a little changed, they come back a little hardened, they come back thinking about whether to honor what he and his comrades in the army and in the air forces have done well.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence and female abuse, as well as domestic violence and gun treatment, according to Wasilla police informant Dan Bennett.
18 States and the Federal District of Columbia support the position taken against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are seeking a change to a new U.S. policy that does not grant asylum to people fleeing gang violence or family violence.
Representatives of 18 states and federal districts have filed a lawsuit against friends in Washington on Friday in support of the raid, according to NBC News.
The full name of the lawyer has not been published in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal lineup in August.
He tells his partner "and his violent gang sons" who insulted him. The U.S. authorities denied him a place of refuge on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
Grace’s attorney general described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, a large part of which are U.S. asylum seekers from countries where gang and family violence are a widespread problem for all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Appeals Board on asylum applications, which said that undocumented migrants could have applied for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Attorney General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new line "will be ignored by states, federal and international law for decades."
"The law of the Federal Republic of Germany requires that all asylum applications be settled on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the letter said.
Prosecutors also claim in the letter that asylum-seekers’ access to the United States is practically detrimental to the economy, as the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and “bring the necessary additional labor force.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges on immigration issues to suspend the granting of asylum from victims of domestic violence and gang violence who fled the country.
"A place of refuge is intended for persons fleeing from their home country for reasons of race, religion, nationality or fear of belonging to a particular class of society or for fear of political opinion", Sessions announced in an opinion on the new asylum policy on 11.6.
The asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even serious problems – that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Unexpected rescues of the survivors continue in Palus – the number of deaths found has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation is getting more serious.
“The situation is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she sat down with her hot baby at the evacuation center in the ruined city of Pula.
"Ambulances bring new bodies every minute.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents return to their ruined homes, pick up their stolen goods and try to save what is left to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged in a 7.5-magnitude collision are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who is suffering from a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Army Hospital, where patients are treated for persistent, severe after-effects.
His eyes are filled with tears as he repeats how a furious earthquake ravaged a fifth-floor hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We couldn’t save ourselves.
I was stuck between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris told the Associated Press, and told her that he and his family were in town as wedding guests.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then I got quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of "provoking" by "propaganda announcements"
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using a U.S. newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after the Chinese newspaper had published a four-page ad in the U.S. newspaper praising the U.S. and the U.S. for its long-range fashion.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to an attachment paid by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register newspaper, which is the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, accused of interfering with China's congressional rallies on November 6.
Trump’s accusations of interfering with Beijing’s efforts in the U.S. elections mean a new stage in Washington’s expanding campaign to pressure China, according to U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war, in which both parties in turn impose tariffs on the counterparty’s export products.
According to Chinese and American experts, China’s tariffs were aimed at states such as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party at the start of the trade war.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowan State, says Beijing has done damage to the U.S. workforce, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating its provocations further by publishing propaganda statements in our own free press," Branstad wrote in an opinion piece published Sunday in the Des Moines Register.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the United States’ esteemed traditions of free speech and the press by placing a paid notice on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“Instead, in the Beijing street newspaper issues, dissenting opinions are only seen in a limited way, and real dissenting opinions that Chinese citizens may not see at all about the alarming development of their economy. This is due to the fact that the media is firmly on the sidelines of the Chinese Communist Party.
Branstad goes on to say that "one of China's biggest newspapers claimed to publish an offer" for an article he wrote, but not exactly what the paper is about.
Kavanaugh's fiasco expels female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
According to analysts, the fact that many of the top Republicans are standing behind Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and defending him may cause a backlash, especially in the upcoming midterms with female voters.
The sentiments surrounding the incident have been on large rounds, and most Republicans have already indicated their desire to move forward with the vote.
“These things can’t be canceled,” said Grant Reeher, a professor at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell Institute, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona) recently offered an FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday and they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and a spokesman for the national reform group MoveOn, according to a newspaper appearing in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming" as they voiced their opinion on the Senate's ruling Republicans' decision to advance in Kavanaugh's nomination, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
“Democratic inspiration and motivation will no longer be evaluated,” says Stu Rothenberg, a non-committal political analyst in an interview with the news site.
“People say that the enthusiasm has already been high, and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially for the insecure female voters in the neighbourhood and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Analysts predicted a possible counter-reaction if the Republicans moved forward with the confirmation, even before Ford’s testimony against the candidate of the highest court, in which he made a claim of sexual harassment.
“This is going to be a mess for the Republican party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put to the question. It’s about how Republicans have acted in this matter and how they’ve dealt with Ford,” said Guy Cecil, the leader of the Democratic-backed group Priorities USA.
The Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided on whether they should believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh's witnesses when the vast majority of them turn to the latter.
According to a new poll by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony is definitive or likely, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh is definitive or likely.
In addition, 38% say they think Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Flake's involvement in the matter, the FBI is investigating Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez's allegations, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified to Kavanaugh’s distress in court when he was 17 years old when he was drunk.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court candidate revealed to him at his family's student parties while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet push for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored, and who has access to any data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was meant to be “world-ruler.”
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “personal data storage” i.e. POD.
It may include contact information lists, reminders, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data warehouse is that it is completely up to the user who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it "personal enforcement through data" and "personal enforcement".
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to provide the resources, processes and skills required to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently includes the security cover purchased by Berners-Leen, Bruce, IBM, some of the project’s paid developers, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website, all of which will be available from this week.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not discussing “with Facebook and Google whether to offer people the perfect change where all their business models are turned upside down in one night.”
"We're not asking for their consent."
Berners-Lee, in a press release on Saturday, wrote that Inrupt’s “task is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new network built for Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee has been the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute since Inrupt’s inception.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The City Remembers the Hero Priests of World War I
The city celebrates the Church of England’s only award-winning, soldier-operated priest, after 100 years of events.
The Medal of Honor was awarded to the Rev. Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 as a result of the attacks on the villages of Bellenglisen and Lehaucourt.
However, the death of Van was created four days later without ever knowing of the highest honour of the British Army.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, says the event was "an impressive symbol"; the memorial was unveiled just 100 years after his award-winning grandfather's career.
On 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in very dense fog and under the fire of heavy field artillery and machine guns."
Later, he crashed into the front line and "showing the greatest bravery" led to the advance of the troops before his assault alone on the field, and in the ensuing battle Vann fell off his own hand with three batters.
Colonel Vann died a German sniper was created on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s act was “something I could never achieve, something that evokes respect.”
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr James Vann fell apart after a parade by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it is "a great honor to be able to take part in the parade" and added: "A great crowd is remembering the honor of a real hero."
Friends waiting to watch the Bellator 206 all night – TV show showed Pipsa Possua
Imagine a situation where you’ve been watching all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and not the whole event.
The program of the event in San Jose featured 13 matches, including six main series matches, and the show was intended to air live on Channel 5 in the UK.
At six o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the round, the show turned into a big outing for Pipsa Possuu’s viewers.
Some of the spectators didn’t really enjoy watching because of the game all night.
A friend of the free-kick opened up on Twitter, describing the replacement of the game with a children’s cartoon “some sort of sick joke”.
“By law, this content was not suitable for presentation at six in the morning, so they had to change it to a children’s program,” explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior marketing and communications assistant manager for the program.
"Pipsa Possu, yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said that the schedules will be worked out so that viewers in the UK can follow the events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a re-sending that we're probably going to get the program working," Coker said.
“However, it’s six o’clock in the morning there and we don’t get the program presented before Sundays in our time, which in turn is Mondays in their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their hands, the messages began to move in both directions and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case, but it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and tried too much.
This is a sad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Knows He's Undervalued for His Sexuality
Swimmer and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he feels inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete says he only noticed when he came to high school that “everyone is not the same as me”.
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Lauren Lavernen said she spoke about gay rights to give others 'hope'.
He also explains how winning the Olympics after having a child was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a long-time radio programme regular, has taken several months off due to illness.
While performing as a guest on Lavernen's first program, Daley said he felt younger than everyone else because "it was socially unacceptable to like boys and jobs."
“To this day, these feelings, to feel less and different, have been a reality, and they have given me the strength and energy that I have needed to succeed.”
He says he wants to prove himself to be ‘something’ so that he won’t disappoint everyone when his sexuality finally reveals itself.
A two-time Olympic apronist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he appears in this year’s Commonwealth Games to appeal for the criminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion tells of his love for a man – Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “a surprise.”
Daley married this self-proclaimed 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says age gap has never been a problem.
“If he experiences so many things so young,” he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find another of the same age who would have experienced similar with-and-off experiences.”
In June, the couple had a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, who changed Daley’s “whole perspective.”
“If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning the gold medal,” he says.
“You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympics tickets, he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he’s not going to be there anymore to be at the forefront,” Daley says.
“I held her hand when her breathing stopped. Only when her breathing had really stopped and she was dead did I finally realize that she wasn’t unharmed,” he says.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew this was something I’ve dreamed of all my life – jumping in front of the home crowd at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first selection of songs – Heather Small’s song “Proud” – which aroused feelings as he prepared for the Olympics, and which still gets his skin on the hen meat.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's semi-final at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to fend for himself to avoid a record-breaking performance as an accident.
Mickelson, who plays at a two-year-old event for the record 12th time, moved to the bench on Saturday to play for fourball and foursome by Captain Jim Fury.
Usually, a five-time major-tournament winner in the U.S. has now spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half on the pitch trying to get his batting under control.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers of his career, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field, where a long-grown scoundrel is punishing for improper blows.
If there’s not enough opposition to Mickelson in the field, the Sunday 9th game will feature the famous British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who plays alongside newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, who aims to seal all four wins this week.
If Americans, who are four points behind in 12 doubles games, get a flying start, Michelson’s game can prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else could be said in the situation.
“He fully understands the role he played today. He patted me on the back, routinely and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is undisputed among the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined something else, but this is how it went and we ended up with this solution.
He wants to be on the field as much as anyone else.”
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo’s record of several Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may also mark the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which, however, has never been comparable to his personal accomplishments.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Fury says his presence brings something indefinable to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, noxious, he likes people at the expense of spoiling and he’s a funny guy that everyone likes,” he explains.
"Younger players also had a lot of fun with him this week, and it's fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long a lead station can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that Ryder Cup’s massive management position before the last day’s doubles can become a messy journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderram, where Seve Ballesteros led the side with a five-point lead over the Americans, but who managed to win with the chalk lines just in the numbers of his nose and won with the narrowest possible margin141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“It reminds us of how we led the way in Valderra, we led the way in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderra, even though we won the way we did,” Bjorn said after looking at the 2018 team’s 5-3 win both on Friday and yesterday at the National Golf Course.
History will show to me and to all the other team members that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we only aim to do that.
As I’ve always said, I’m focused on these 12 players who play on our side, but we’re aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Rejoiced at how his team’s players have progressed from a difficult field, Bjorn adds: “I’ll never be down until I get into such things.
Tomorrow is a completely different matter.
Tomorrow the priority will be individual implementations, and then we will talk about different things.
It’s great to be on the field with your partner when everything is going well, but when the field is alone, then the player’s capacity is tested with foundations.
This is a message that must be conveyed to the players – tomorrow everyone will be able to achieve the best performance.
Now you have to give up the partner who gets him to go [to the field alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Furyk will require his players to perform better as individuals than they could as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the final day's full swings in both directions. He was part of the team that won in Brooklyn before ending up as a loser, when the European team won "Medina's Miracle".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied to the question of how the 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw drove the lines of his team to the last day’s matches.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like it happened in Brooklyn, or like it happened in Medina.
When you get things moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have arranged our assembly accordingly and put the boys on the field in the way we want, as you know, we are going to do miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the defense and he meets Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are in order to meet their European counterparts next.
"I put the team's guys in this order because I think it's going through the whole tournament," Bjorn said in a statement.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The newest frigate of the German fleet should have been launched in 2014. The purpose of the ship is to replace the aging pre-Cold War equipment, but it will be launched at the earliest next year due to faulty systems and explosively growing costs, according to local media.
According to a military spokeswoman for Die Zeit newspaper, ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’, the launch of the first ship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg frigate class has been delayed for the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems have defied an ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen class frigates.
According to the available data, they are equipped with an effective hammer, anti-aircraft and surface-to-air missile systems as well as anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft technology, such as radar reflectivity and technology to reduce the visibility of infrared and acoustic signals.
The ship’s important features also include its longer service life – new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without having to spend time at home.
However, the continuing delays mean that high-tech warships – which are said to be aimed at improving German influence in the maritime regions – are already obsolete when they enter service, the newspaper Die Zeit notes.
The bad luck F125 frigate ended in headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to launch the launch and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media has talked about the essential "software and hardware flaws" that make war-fighting useless.
The lack of software is particularly important because the size of the crew of ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class is about 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's possibilities for subsequent upgrades.
With a capacity of 7,000 tonnes, the Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used in World War II in Germany.
In addition to the wrong equipment, the whole project price box is also a problem.
The price is said to have risen to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, when the original price was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the introduction of new frigates have emerged when the German navy has recently been warned of shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, said earlier this year that the fleet’s ships are “going to the least.”
According to the authority, the problem has increased over time because old ships have been removed from service, but no new ones have been delivered in place.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could be used by the fleet.
The environmental organization is spying on the secret life of the butterflies
A new study, conducted in the Scottish Highlands, seeks to find out how bats use the terrain when hunting for food.
The new study is hoped to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to guide future protective measures.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, examines the pests and beetles, as well as earworms and waterfowl in the Inverewe Garden area of Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor the operation of the flaps during the season.
The organisation’s staff and volunteers also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequency of the reviews, as well as the types involved at any time, will be ensured by expert analysis.
Based on the results, a living environment map and report are created, in which the behaviour of bedbugs can be presented in a picture that follows the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization’s natural health advisor, hopes to reveal the results, which areas of the habitat are the most important for reptiles, and how different species make use of them.
Information is helpful in the design of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, so that bats and related species are taken into account.
The rest of Scotland and the whole of Great Britain have declined significantly over the last hundred years.
Construction and land works threaten the resting places and habitats of the dams.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flypapers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks on pets.
In fact, they are not blind.
However, due to night hunting conditions, their ears are more useful for catching prey than for the eyes.
The bats use advanced noise detection technology to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organization focused on the protection of the rural environment, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country – and they take the limelight seriously.
In its service there are ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of resting places and, in some cases, rescue operations of animals.
The organisation has even established the first and only Thraven Manor in Scotland for the protection of seals in the Dumfries and Galloway region, where eight of Scotland's ten seals meet.
According to estate manager David Thompson, the area is ideal for holidaymakers.
"Threave is very well suited for the ducks," he says.
“We have old buildings and trees and a good living environment in general.
We don’t know everything about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us better understand what bats need to succeed.”
He stresses the importance of checking buildings for bedbugs before refurbishment, because the destruction of one bedbug’s place of rest can inadvertently cause up to 400 female bedbugs and a boy’s death and destroy the entire local population.
Reptiles are protected animals and killing, disturbing or destroying their places of rest is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the bat protection organisation, encourages the public to take part in the protection work.
He says, “We still have a lot to learn from our bats, and we still don’t know how their populations will manage.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing a legal case against a German newspaper <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled rape allegations against him as “fake news” and says people want to “advertise themselves” by using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action to bring Der Spiegel, a German newspaper, to justice.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid the victim $375,000 for a silent stay, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram's live feed to 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made. A 33-year-old footballer vehemently opposed the allegations and described them as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is fake news," a five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it belongs to this profession.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing Der Spiegel’s challenge to the court over the allegations they have called a “reckless reporting of privacy concerns,” according to the Reuters news agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is demanding compensation for "personal suffering according to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged case is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan are reported to have met at a nightclub and moved to a player's room where he is alleged to have raped him in an anal manner, according to papers filed with the Clark County Regional Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99% good guy", but that "one percent" caused disappointment.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that a couple had engaged in sex, but that it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claimed to have visited the police station and taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later ended up in a settlement settlement because she was "terrified of the possibility of revenge" and worried about "going to public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking to cancel the conciliation because he is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to a deal to move to Real Madrid during the alleged Manchester United upset, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus on a $100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain ‘stopped to regret’ the end of car manufacturing
Britain would "be forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, Economy Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he considers the announcement of Toyota’s UK unit to temporarily suspend production at its factory near Derby in Burnaston if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
“We need a deal,” Clark says.
A Japanese carmaker says the impact of border delays will be seen as job losses if Brexit is concluded without a deal.
The factory in Burnaston, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory will be interrupted,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota Burnaston’s unit.
Other car manufacturers operating in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about leaving the European Union on how cross-border trade will operate.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini manufacturing plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concern, according to the car manufacturers’ report, is the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and cars are manufactured on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could cause border disruption, which according to the sector could lead to delays and disruptions.
According to Toyota, it is impossible to maintain a stable warehouse for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, and production would be halted.
Clark says Theresa May’s EU relations plan is “exactly calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We need a deal, we want the best possible deal that not only means success in the current situation, but it's an opportunity that we have to take advantage of," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“Not only Toyota, but also the opinions of other manufacturers show that we absolutely need to be able to continue the very well-functioning supply chain series so far.”
Toyota does not know how long production should be halted, but warns that additional costs should reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and serves as a supplier of the trade association at the factory, says of growing concern among members: “In my experience, lost jobs never return.
The government's spokesperson said: "We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump’s challenging meeting with Assistant Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could “engage in moving yet another week” around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia’s interference in the elections, the connections between Trump’s aides to Russia and the president’s possible actions to prevent justice.
In Washington, it has been rumored for months that Trump intends to separate the U.S. Attorney General, which would jeopardize Mueller’s impartiality.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported on Rosenstein’s discussion of the possibility of recording secret talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of separating the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was to inform Rosenstein of his resignation from the office.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York at the time, so the date of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to separate Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed because its timing coincided with a Senate Judiciary hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI’s week-long investigation into Kavanaugh’s allegations, which further delayed the Senate’s vote.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News’ Sunday program.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said: "The date has not been set for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for another week due to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court right now.
But I always want to keep the press up-to-date."
Some of the journalists may disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked the reason for this.
Sanders said the reason for the lack of press coverage was due to reasons other than opposition to the “attentionalness” of TV broadcasters, but said: “I don’t deny the fact that they are attention-grabbing.”
Sanders, however, made it clear that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more questioning hours than any president before him,” he says, adding further evidence without citing: “We’ve checked those numbers.”
“The press events will still be organised,” Sanders said, but “it’s infinitely better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss with me.
We try to act this way often and you have seen us act this way many times over the past few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or by participating in open-ended events or with valuable people visiting the press.
Attending a press conference alone is rare.
This week in New York, the President possibly pointed out the reason for this, when it came to the reporters who had met strangely on the spot.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to employees of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) from EU countries in relation to fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter from EU countries to employees of the Scottish healthcare system to express their gratitude and hope for their stay in the country after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter while the time for the UK to leave the EU is less than six months away.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs that will be incurred in the "fixed status" of EU citizens working in the field of specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
The Government of the United Kingdom has also stepped up preparations for a possible non-contractual separation.
I know these are insecure times for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much we value each of our employees for their contribution to citizenship.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery
Christion Abercrombie, a supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers, has been in an emergency surgery since losing 31–27 to the Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, Tennessee reporter Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the sideline and just shortened it,” Reed says.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie acid at the sideline before putting her on the pair and taking her to the side for a more accurate evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “the type/width of the injury is not known at this stage,” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at the University of Tennessee State and plays the first time on a team from Illinois after his move.
He had five innings on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 innings this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
The aim of the change is to neutralize Corby’s success in attracting young voters.
Lifting the stamp duty applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today the higher stamp duty rate payable by foreign buyers when they buy real estate in the UK. The extra money is used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper housing and paid attention to the taxation of the beneficiaries.
The levying of the stamp duty is aimed at people and businesses that do not pay taxes to the UK. The extra money from this is directed to the government's actions to facilitate the uninhabited effort.
The additional fee – which is added to the current stamp tax in addition to the second-home and investment housing increases that were added two years ago – can be up to three per cent.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to yield up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
An estimated 13 per cent of London’s new buildings will be purchased from non-UK permanent residents, which will raise prices and make it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK – especially in its capital – have become a ‘shadow city’ because many foreign real estate owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new approach comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in stamp duty as a way to make it easier for young people to buy first-class homes.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and leaving it unbuilt, and urged Prime Minister May to reject quotas for affordable housing to fix Britain’s “shameful housing situation.”
Corbyn has published a series of proposals to revamp the housing market, including rent restrictions and the end of "productive deductions".
He would also like to give the delegations more power in matters relating to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May said: “I said last year I wanted to dedicate my prime ministerial career to the British dream – that every generation’s life should be better than its predecessors.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, can buy homes as easily as tough British residents.
Too many people have become too distant a dream of owning a home, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "primary goal" is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is excited about the challenge of raising the northern corner of the country's home team back to their feet. The team is currently ranked third in the UK's second division.
Ross moved to the "Stadion of Lights" this summer after he had directed St Mirren back to the Scottish side last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my team.
I got into the second team and that was it," Ross told the BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
“As a child, I often watched with my father the Scottish games at Hampden, and it’s something that has always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will only come up if I succeed as the manager of the company.”
Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he wasn’t worried about joining his famous predecessors’ shoes in a nominative band. He has previously opposed the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At the moment, I am measuring my own success by whether I can return this team to the polls.
On the basis of the structure and capacity of the association, it undoubtedly belongs to the electorate,” he says.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably only consider myself successful if I get my confidence back in the team.”
Ross has only been a manager for three years: first as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats coaching team.
After this, he helped Alloa rise from the three-match series of fall games and raised St Mirren's team to the championship during the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his playing career in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical teams.
“I was probably in a real relationship with my career,” he recalls the time when he moved to Alla’s leadership.
“I thought I was a better manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, earned a decent one, and got to enjoy some of the relatively big successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player has to figure out a lot of things every week.
I’m still going through the same things, like stress and pressure from work, but leading the team feels just the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I do it for my job. I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life.”

The summer heat wave has given a kick to pubs struggling with British difficulties, but at the same time has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
According to figures compiled by Peter Martin, a business consultancy at CGA, "Continuing sunny weather and England's projected longer participation in the football World Cups meant that July was the highest in terms of sales of pubs like June, with a 2.8% increase in turnover.
The June 1.8% drop in restaurant sales was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the drink side were the best. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in restaurant sales.
Pubs that focus on the food side also suffer from vomiting, but less dramatically than restaurant spinners.
It seems that people just want to drink out in their minds.
Sales of pubs and bars run by businesses increased by 6.6% over the course of a month, and food sales fell by 3%.”
Paul Newman, from RSM, which offers consultancy services in the leisure and hotel-restaurant sector, says: “The results continue the trend, which has continued since the end of April.
The weather and large social or sporting events are the biggest factors influencing the sale of the market outside the home.
It is no surprise that the fight against food chains continues, although the annual sales decline of 4.8% is escalating, especially now that the industry is struggling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer couldn’t have come to the worst samami for food-focused operators, and it’s only time to show if the eukaryotes bring the cooler temperatures of the sector to the painfully needed respiration.
The combined growth in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is the next barometer for UK pub, bar and restaurant sales, which compiles and analyzes results from a group of 47 professionals with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. It is considered as a reliable gauge of the industry.
Five percent of children hide social media accounts from their parents
Five out of five children – including up to 11-year-olds – hide social media accounts from parents and teachers, the study says.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed the existence of a growing phenomenon of ‘Instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concerns that accounts can be shared with sexually-enhanced content
20% of students said they like the ‘key account’ that is shown to parents
Five out of five children – some of whom are up to 11 years old – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapidly growing existence of ‘Instagram fake accounts’, referring to an Instagram site intended to share images.
The news has raised fears that sexual content may be published on the accounts.
Twenty percent of the students said they thought that a clean ‘key account’ for parents should be shown while using other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenage boy in which he hoped to be raped after crashing into his 13-year-old daughter’s secret website.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC found that 40 per cent of young people aged 11-18 years had two separate profiles, and half of respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers feel attracted to setting up online classrooms that parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle's "Voice of Athletes" to the Scottish Athletes' Government
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletes' Board of Directors as a non-executive member, taking part in the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most awarded general athlete, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the board, describes the appointment as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international experience he has gathered over the past decade.
“Eilidhi is greatly respected amongst athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would greatly benefit from his appointment to the government,” Beattie says.
Doyle says: “I look forward to my role as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can be of benefit and help guide the Scottish sport in the right direction.”
Four Olympic gold medals won by an American athlete who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, and who now serves as a permanent commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to walk as a result of a blood-sucking brain disorder.
She wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time will show, recovery and in what condition.
This has been a tiresome job, but I’ve recovered completely, learned to walk again and now I’m training already!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Advertising similar to cows for mothers Shares Opinions Online
Breast-feeding moms from a company that manufactures breast pumps have shared their opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, who manufactures consumer technology, has brought to the market a product called "the world's first voiceless and wearable breast pump". Its marketing is boosted by an ad that matches the style of music videos, which depicts a new amber
Four real-life moms dance in a haystack filling the hays, including the following song saying, "Yes, I lick myself, but she doesn't look" and "if you don't get noticed, they're not weird, they're tits."
The narrator continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, lick my cheeks.”
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page caused an online discussion.
The video, which has garnered 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has sparked conflicting reactions among viewers, many say it makes fun of the daily ‘terribles’ of the dairy industry.
"Using the blades in advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and have to be born in order to produce milk, but their babies will be stolen from them soon after they are born," one commenter wrote.
Elvie breast pump fits remarkably well in the breast pocket (Elvie/Mother)
Another viewer commented: “Understandably, it’s traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why can’t they be used to advertise a breast pump to mothers who can have their baby?”
The third commenter added: "Perfectly reality-obsessed advertising."
I also received an ad: a woman admitted that she thought the ad was "stupid".
“I think this is a great idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a ridiculous product,” reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: “This is a funny advertisement that is aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the water) and ‘feel like cows’.
The purpose of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry.’
At the end of the ad, the women of the video reveal that they have danced with the inconspicuous pumps in their breasts.
The concept of the ad campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, it has no wires and ducts and it is remarkably suitable for breastfeeding in diapers, allowing women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even visit the outside during pumping.
Ana Balar, Partner and Artistic Director of the Mother Advertising Agency, commented: "The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative income on the market.
By comparing nursing mothers and midwives, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump to the lighthouse, bringing out the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump brings to life in a fun and convivial way.”
The Elvie pump has ended up in the headlines before.
During fashion weeks in London, the mother of two children appeared on a catwalk in the costume of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in complete silence
The number of committed migrant children has increased sharply, despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that, as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration, children have been placed in a position to be placed in foster care.
Most placement families have traditionally consisted of undocumented immigrants, and registering as a placement family can jeopardise their own residence in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy must be given fingerprints and that this information will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs authority, testified last week in Congress that the agency had detained dozens of people who had applied for asylum for underage immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
“Almost 80% of the people who are either members of the local family or members of their households are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
So we will continue to look for these people,” Albence says.
In an effort to deal with cases of children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which, in some cases, the matter must be dealt with in court within a month, instead of the 60-day time limit previously in use.
Many prefer to appear through videoconference rather than in person in a court of law dealing with the affairs of immigrants.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be expelled immediately.
According to reports published in the last months by the reception centres’ staff and the system, the time spent in children’s prisons affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent demolitions or refugee enterprises.
According to lawyers, concern is highlighted in particular in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's despair may be overlooked due to the large size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for it or saying goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many of the children are already suffering from trauma right now.
Syria orders U.S., French, and Turkish “ownership forces” to leave immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops were in the country illegally using the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will work with them accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the general assembly.
Moualem said the “anti-terrorism war is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and beyond, and where millions of people have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the “holy struggle until the whole of Syria is cleansed” of both terrorist organizations and “illegal foreign forces.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding Arab forces against the Kurds and President Bashar al-Assad.
France has put more than 1,000 troops in the ground to fight.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were good for returning and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
“We have called on the international community and aid agencies to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They politicized something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid to Syria before the end of the war has been agreed between Assad and the opposition by a political agreement.
According to U.N. diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last stronghold of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity for political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the territory where three million people live.
Moualem has stressed, however, that the agreement has “clear timelines” and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra fighters, “who will be destroyed.”
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee of members of the new government and opposition to create a draft post-war Syrian constitution and to level the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "checking the current constitutional loopholes" and warned of interference in the matter.
Why Trump will be elected for another term
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, the inauguration and scandal decide his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential decision ever!”
So far, no signs of fatigue have been detected in the audience.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in its best viewing time compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show has reached the top 3.5 million viewers on cable TV.
“This is a trap that attracts people because it’s one that we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC’s Designated Survivor program, about the minister who will rise as president after the attack destroyed the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, is another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he wanted to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
The cage has an entertainment value.
Of course, apart from other TV programs, the news from Washington can determine how the Roe vs. Wade case is going, whether members of immigrant families are able to create each other, and how the global economy can.
Immediateness is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duties of an informed citizen to look at a six-hour panel of experts arguing the use of Bob Woodward's source data for the book for Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 structuring pilot's jacket (according to the Washington Post's "Trump's tweet" and a tweet from the press conference.

When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, at his place on the northern coast of Kauai there was a wonderful sunny day, but he couldn’t go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.

“I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss said.

From the outside, money flows into a tight outdoor campaign
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th constituencies have faced real cash flow, as two candidates already elected for the reorganisation of the congressional constituencies have to fight from one place.
This newly-restricted Pittsburgh constituency is a battle-challenge for the Democratic Conor Lamb, who took his place from the second constituency in last spring's special election.
Lamb will compete with fellow Republican candidate Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s 12th-old constituency, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The division of territories was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituency favored Republicans contrary to the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th constituencies has started in the main financial divisions of the parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name became known in Pennsylvania after the March special elections in the 18th Pennsylvania congressional district that were widely attended.
The place had been Republican for over ten years and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 percent.
Political commentators have made a great first step for the Democrats.
U.S. Plans to Punish El Salvador for Supporting China, But Resigns From Its Intentions
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already taken note of the situation in Beijing and Washington’s mild reaction.
President Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he also owned the hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials decided to invite U.S. diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama "on the basis of recent lines that say Taiwan will no longer be recognized," the department said in a statement.
However, the sanctions were considered only for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, as well as development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit a Central American state with a high level of unemployment and a high level of mental health.
As the internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities delayed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity. The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in companies to prevent migrants from seeking to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that the meeting was about to move forward and this effectively led to speculation about possible punishment for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give a kind of signal to the mid-October meeting on the importance of governance for the meeting, diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further distressing messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke in the protection of anonymity.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be a special counsel Robert Mueller report on President Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, which is now very serious evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also reported an ongoing investigation into whether Trump’s campaign was secretive in cooperation with Russia when Russia interfered in the U.S. election.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go back to his constituents, and possibly be condemned by his peers.
There are a lot of contests here, and I’m not saying that the loss of President Trump would be inevitable – more so than the loss of like-minded people in Europe.
We have to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those solutions determine how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to take Hitler’s side if the West had also resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points as the inevitable march of democracy either accelerates or slows down.
Americans are now faced with a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump dismisses Assistant Secretary of State Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating Mueller’s case?
Rosenstein has been flattered since it came to public knowledge that he had proposed a secret recording of the president's speech and considered the president's possible inability to handle his duties.
According to Rosenstein, the Times report is wrong.
"How do we react if the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's actions is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and unfair evidence?"
And above all, are we voting in the polls for a congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these endeavours, our democracy will have a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was Jewish in Czechoslovakia and she was expelled from Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that once filled my diplomatic mission.
He survived, moved to America as a migrant, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that hooker's table.

Rangers Graham Dorrans as an optimist for Rapid Wien
The Rangers will meet at their home in Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that earlier in the same month, after a draw against Villarreal in Spain, the Austrians’ win would give the team a strong position to reach the G-block of the Europa League.
Polvivamma prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from reaching the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a scoreboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal has a good answer," the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game with the expectation that we could get something and we brought the point with us.
We might have been able to catch the win at the end, but overall the balance game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got to speed in the second and we were better.
Thursday is once again an important night in the Europa League.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game because their results were good in the previous game, but I believe that with the support of this team we will be able to give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough on my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy; the workouts are going well.
Hopefully we can now press fully, leave the men behind us for the season and succeed.”
Retirement-Related Fear of Taking Overnights from Women
While the study participants had a clear view of how they hoped to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones about it.
About half of the participants in a nationwide study reported talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the issue for granted,” says Holly Snyder, deputy director of the national life insurance company.
Start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them of your wishes in time.
Talk to the professional and your family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important cost determining factor.
Take financial advice with you in the discussion: advice can also help you to come up with a way to cover these costs.
Financial options for long-term care can include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or self-insurance if you have a spare.
Make legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a healthcare representative on the spot so that you can appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that your professionals comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider writing a master’s thesis for the treatment of your financial affairs.
It allows you to set up a trusted person to take care of financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your invoices will be paid if you can’t take care of them yourself.
Also, keep in mind the little details: imagine that your elderly parent would be in a health emergency on the way to the hospital.
Would you like to answer questions about her medication and her allergies?
Write such information in the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just about the financial side. Who's his doctor?" Martin asks.

Indonesia Earthquakes and Tsunami
At least 384 people have died in a violent earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to rise.
As communication links to the area have been broken, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the northern part of the municipality of Donggala, which is closer to the surface of the 7.5-magnitude barrier.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Key facts about Pausta and Donggagasta located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located in a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami hit the city's 40th anniversary celebrations.
The municipality of Donggala covers more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) of coastline of the northern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative area of the province, with a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi Province, and especially the coastal region of Donggala, are fishing and agriculture.
The breakout of nickel is also important, but it is focused on the opposite coast of Morowali Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, several tsunamis have hit Pulu and Donggala over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of the Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is seismically active in the Pacific Ring of Fire region and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 states and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in the coastal waters of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 magnitude quake struck the southernmost island of Indonesia, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast of the island killing nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, which is the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake struck one of Sumatra's Mentawai islands, causing a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial disturbance struck Aceh's Pidie Jaya area causing destruction and panic in people's memory of the massive destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than a hundred people died when the buildings collapsed.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in isolation.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
The oldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice president-elect Track Palin has been arrested on suspicion of overcrowding.
According to a police report on Saturday, Palin, 29, from Alaska’s Wasi, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and for preventing and resisting domestic violence in connection with the arrest.
According to a police report, Palin took a phone call from a female companion when he tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is in pretrial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial and has been fined $500, KTUU TV reported.
According to the report, Palin arrived in court on Saturday and replied that he was "certainly innocent".
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means he can get up to a one-year prison sentence and $250,000 in fines.
He is also charged with a Class B felony, which can be sentenced to a day's imprisonment and $2,000 in fines.
Palin's not the first time he's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of mistreating his father Todd Palin.
That's when Palin's mother called the police and announced the cover-up.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palini was charged with domestic violence, which involved the possession of a weapon under the influence of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palini of punching her face.
Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for associating her son’s violent behavior with a traumatic stress disorder caused by a service rendered in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
With a magnitude of 7.5, the earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications connections are gone and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi, north of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, he's been making videos since the lockdown.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festivals in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
U.S. Prosecutors Consider Dropping Rare Death Penalty on Suspected NYC Terrorist Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipoville, a New York City-based suspect in a terrorist attack that has claimed eight lives, a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used the Home Depot rental car in an October accident on the West Side Highway in Manhattan’s south, where he drove on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a New York City Southern Administrative District death penalty filing, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors are able to show that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight of his victims and caused “intentionally” serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, it is possible to bring down the death penalty for both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court charged Saipoville with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder to assist the terrorist organization. The federal prosecutors typically use this term in cases of crime-related offences and in cases of incitement to commit crimes.
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation", the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed his work as "exciting, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to Diego Enrique Angelinin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtin, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferruchin, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci's families," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
A decade has passed since the death penalty was imposed on New York’s southern administrative district.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in New York in the case of the federal government in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any signs of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about his work, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he received inspiration after watching the ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He replied to a 22-year-old charge that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saipovia, said the defense was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and not recognition and life imprisonment without the possibility of release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused to those involved in these events," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had previously asked him not to be sentenced to death.
The Conservative MP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today in a protest against the Conservatives to "mobilize the civilian army."
The former Ukip leader said that politicians need to feel pressure from Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own parliamentarians suggested that she lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative rower Peter Bone told the marchers in Birmingham that Britain would “already be out” if Farage was a Brexit secretary.
But May faces deep-seated divisions as she reconciles with the challenge of remaining conservatives, who have joined in a separate anti-Brexit rally in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on the surface of Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU’s pressure.
Supporters call on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite a backlash - and to force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and the chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to "pick up the Chequers proposal to go."
He proposed that Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out already," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but the Chequers proposal must be removed."
He presented his EU opposition, saying: "We did not fight the world war to end up being subordinates.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.”
Bone pushed the idea that public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: “The fact that the British had changed their mind and would like to stay is a completely false claim.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not supported by party members and activists who are really going to the streets and are generally responsible for our success.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening.”
In a message addressed to May, he added: "Prime Ministers can keep their job when they keep their promise."
Farage said politicians need to feel pressure if they plan to overturn a decision made on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is about trust between the people and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to water Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we don’t accept it.”
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are going to run for Brexit to feel the pressure behind you.”
“We are going to mobilize this country’s citizens’ army, which gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is again an independent, self-governing and proud state.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched across Birmingham before the two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists hung the Tories Against Brexit tents. The group was set up this weekend.
The Labour Party’s Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security problems they had with the party’s app at the beginning of the meeting.
“These are the people who say they’re getting their IT systems in order and all the technology for Canada plus plus arrangement and unspoilt border operations for free Irish trade,” he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering presidential impeachment.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering presidential impeachment after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will meet in November in the revamped Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren is expected to make a possible stand against Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyok was with voters at his 36th city hall meeting after Trump’s season began.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that now is the time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes women in the highest place.”
Arrest in Sims shooting case at LSU
Louisiana Baton Rouge police said on Saturday they had arrested a man suspected of Friday's shooting that led to the death of LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police announced Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. at the ET briefing.
Police had released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot near Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a gun to his head and died as a result,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the media on Saturday via the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being in the interrogations, holding a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not make any arrests and was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championships after offering him a win over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’ team arrangements play an important role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and left Hamilton with almost his own luck in defending his place in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to face his teammate.
Vettel went to the barn first and left Hamilton to drive a crowd behind, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went on a tour later and returned to Vettel, but Hamilton moved over after a little contact and the Ferrari driver moved in counter-intuitively, giving up his position after two thirds of his turnover.
Max Verstappen, who spent his 21st birthday, started his acting career and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition as he extended the tyre exchange, aiming for a quick finish and fourth place from Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>s.
He finally came to the podium in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds when R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri performed brilliantly throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me through.
The team has made an exceptional career by achieving a double victory,” Hamilton said.
Very bad body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein’s claim that she did not publicly leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking on the occasion in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but noted that what was going on in the Senate was an indication of people’s “evening, disgust and dishonesty.”
“That one possible thing, that wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the past few days, seeing the pain, people who are angry, evil, outraged and unfair,” he said.
“When we see publications and leaked stuff and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you have this information?
Do you remember his answer...did you hand over the document – ‘Oh, what?
I don't.
I didn't bleed."
Hold on a second.
"We're going to... No, we're not going to," he added.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in his office.
“I didn’t hide Professor Ford’s accusations, and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential according to his wishes."
But his ban did not apply to the president, who commented on the matter on Saturday on the occasion: "I'm telling you, that was very bad for body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that was the worst I've ever seen of body language."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court's candidate, which three women have accused of sexual harassment and calculated that the Democrats are using accusations for their own benefit.
"They have decided to regain power by any means.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars applied for a refund on Friday against the Belfast Giants for losing to the Elite League by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead position thanks to two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauwiller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the levels before Dwyer returned to the Giants leadership position.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the win.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefen, who won against Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
The teams faced Giants for the fourth time in the season after winning three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's innings, David Rutherford's innings when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the quarter-finals, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt fed the Cowboys a draw at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants lead position for the first time while hitting his second goal of the night at the end of the first set.
The home team assembled their line-up and Bouchard scored again in an overtime goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen managed to make Dundee their first lead at the end of the second half, and he also secured a victory for his team in the fifth half of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
The pilot died while making sure that hundreds of passengers on the plane escaped from an earthquake.
In Indonesia, the pilot has become a hero after his death, ensuring that hundreds of passengers on board the plane safely got into the air.
More than 800 people have died and several are missing after a severe earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi Island on Friday.
The region is being tested by severe repercussions, and several people have been left trapped in the wreckage of material in the city of Palu.
Although his fellow workers fled the trade, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawa Agung did not leave his job at the wildly winding air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palus.
He stayed in place and made sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, was safely airborne.
After that, he jumped out of the air traffic control tower, which he thought was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s Yohannes Sirait said Agung’s decision could save hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
From Kalimantan, Balikpapan, a helicopter was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
I'm sorry he died this morning before the helicopter got back to him.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims will increase by thousands, as the country’s disaster authorities have declared links to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Bouton.
“The death toll is believed to continue to rise because many bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves of up to six metres have been destroyed by Prayu, which will host mass gatherings on Sundays.
Military and armoured vehicles bring help and equipment to the area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: #Ambulances carry bodies all the time.
There is no shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, Indonesia’s head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is accelerating to help the survivors, but we don’t know what awaits us.
This is already a tragedy, but it may prove even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Reunion on Sunday and said in a speech to the country’s armed forces: “I ask you all to work night and day so that all tasks related to the evacuation can be dealt with.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in an earthquake in Indonesia’s Lombok.
Micronesian plane crash: According to Air Niugin, one person is missing after a plane crashes into a lagoon
Representatives of the airline, which crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now report that one person is missing, although all 47 passengers and crew members have been evacuated from the plane safely sinking, according to the previous announcement.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was trying to find the man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
The local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane had crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuki Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people remained in the hospital on Saturday and the condition of all was stable.
The reasons for the storm and the precise course of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was overrun by a runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to swam in a drowning plane in a water-tight waistline for emergency exits.
He told the crew that he had panicked and cried, and that he himself got a slight headache.
The U.S. Navy said it was involved in rescues of the sailors involved in repairs to the nearby port by transporting people to the beach by a rubber boat before the plane sank about 30 meters (one hundred feet) deep into the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in the crash.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed a retrial in which a man was charged with the burning of a Mississippian woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data stored on his cell phone when he collected the actions of one of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers as the deathbed of the victim.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was against his previous allegations with Chambers the night he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that the Tellis cell phone was with Chambers at the same time that Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police interrogated Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "is lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on the data stored on the mobile phone, they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," Hale said.
The final rounds of the defence are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed with the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What Should I Know About Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge genre-related negative notions by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to the Bristol-based group The High Breed, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make the conscious hip hop again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have been able to witness Britain’s new rise with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark one?!
New York babysitter sues couple for racist text message
A New York babysitter challenges the couple’s right of discriminatory separation after accidentally receiving a text message from the child’s mother, in which she complains that she is “another dark-skinned”.
The couple are arguing that they are racists and likens the challenge to "Christianity."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her grief when new babysitter Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first day of work in 2016 and told her that it was dark brown.
"EIIIII, TAAS TUMMAIHOINEN", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to the man in a text message.
Then, however, he sent a message to Giselle Maurice, twice instead of her husband.
Realizing the mistake Plasco-Flaxman had made, according to the New York Post, separated Maurice, noting that his former African-American babysitter had done his job poorly and this time he had been waiting for Filipinos.
Maurice got paid one of his working days and was sent home by taxi.
Maurice is now challenging the couple’s right to get a severance payment and wants a compensation of $350 a day for a six-month period, for which he had originally been robbed of living and working in the family, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t do that,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple has responded to racist claims saying that ending Maurice’s employment relationship was a justified solution because they could not trust him after he was raped.
“My wife sent him something she wasn’t supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told Post in an interview.
"But would you leave your child to the notice of a person you've been unfriendly to, even if only accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco joined the challenge of tightening and I said that his wife had had had had a baby two months earlier and was "very in a difficult situation."
“Are we going to fight in such a situation?
It’s not very comfortable,” the investment banker added.
Even though the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media by tarnishing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers feared that the audience would not get into a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, says of the article: “It is difficult to live in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It’s interesting now that Paddington’s huge popularity is known.”
Noting that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before devoting himself to writing children’s books about the adventures of the toy bear, had been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the publication of the books at the age of 60 felt like his father’s centenary.
Paddington was "described to be a very important member of the family" and said his father was still proud of its success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not a tiresome guy at all," she says.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child’s achievement for him; the one you’re proud of, even though it’s not really your own time.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his creation, he always gave Paddington credit for himself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter was hospitalized after landing at the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors were desperately trying to save her life.
“They called a little bit of a difference and told the situation was really bad that he wasn’t expected to survive,” Ednan-Laperouse says.
Then they called and said that my daughter is going to die in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you very much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The drugs that kept her heart going, gradually disappeared from her body, the doctors said.
He had died a little earlier, and now everything is gone.
I could just sit there knowing it was all over.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together.”
In the end, Ednan-Laperouse, grieving for the loss of his daughter, got on a plane among other passengers - who knew nothing of the ordeal he was going through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I held my head down and the tears were pouring all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a huge sense of compassion for Nadia.
That he now needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved my daughter.”
Dead women send cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones are working to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out cards with encouraging messages and a phone number that can be supported.
Davis' son Tyler became depressed at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to experience the feelings I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with a contagious cold.
“They knew his smile.
Everyone said that his smile lights up the whole room.”
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt he was “in the dark”.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old little brother found his brother, who had torn his life apart.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of side effects.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Humphreys has been Davies' friend for several years and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was down or depressed or anything,” Humphreys said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the kids opened their presents, he didn’t take a look at them or anything like that.”
He notes that Mark’s death was a difficult trauma for them, but they still have to figure out ahead: “It breaks the family down.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to go on living and fight forward.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought that if we could really achieve what he hoped for – a time and scale-limited investigation – we might be able to achieve a bit of unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “disintegrate” into the threat posed by supporters.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Reluctance is a matter of timing.
The parades are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans’ success is as low as expected, their attempt to get the man they want elected to the country’s highest court will be hampered.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called the senators to applaud their support for Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush and met through him his wife Ashley, who was President Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is made?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, is holding a vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow the game over and confirm his choice to the highest court.
The number of North Koreans is falling during Kim’s
South Korean lawmaker Kim Jong-un said the number of South Koreans who defected from North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Integration as saying that the searches took place last year in 1,127 - in 2011 they took place 2,706.
According to Park, the decisive factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the increase in the prices of smugglers.
Pyongyang has not commented on this publicly.
The majority of North Koreans will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
It is estimated that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between Koreas.
China treats scoundrels as illegal immigrants and not as refugees and most often returns them by force.
Technically speaking, relations between North Korea and South Korea in the war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the country’s leaders met in Pyongyang and the talks focused on the denuclearization of the talks that are currently under way.
This was followed by a historic June meeting in which U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un met in Singapore and agreed on a general level on the quest for nuclear neutrality in the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for sticking to its sanctions after the meeting.
“Without any kind of trust from the United States, our national security is not based on trust, and under such circumstances, we will not in any case unilaterally dismantle our equipment first,” Ri told the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the highest court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said this was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on the matter in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had acted that way, she would be called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her own reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were in their teens.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in the power of his emotions and in between he almost cried and lost his speaking ability when telling about his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the committee’s Democratic members without calling the charges against themselves “a grotesque and deliberate persecution of the person” organized by Hillary Clinton’s angry liberals over the loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed in Kavanaugh's witness testimony to show that he was not capable of acting in the highest court because it proved him to be a party to the Democrats.
“I think he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi wondered if he would take up office against Kavanaugh if this choice were confirmed and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“Let’s say that if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not qualified not only for the highest court, but also the court where he’s currently working,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently working in the U.S. Court of Appeals.
He added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned by Kavanaugh's possible provisions regarding the health reform or the Roe v. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh, in his confirmation hearings, avoided questioning whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical and partisan person to be elected as a member of the judiciary and we would expect to see that it's great," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with everything.
It is a justified speech of fire when the rage of months and years has grown over, and he must not hold it without crying.
“We’ll survive when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual at all, do you?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leadership position somewhere and who said that she was crying when she got angry, but that she had developed a way of saying to her speaking partner in a situation where she got angry and started to cry: ‘You might think I’m sad now.
I'm really angry."
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was a negro.”
Tears get right as a path of breaking out of anger, even though they are usually understood fundamentally wrong.
One of the most memorable memories of my early job in a male office is that once I cried out in a voiceless rage and the older woman – a cold-blooded boss I was always a little scared of – grabbed me from my neck and dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad, and then they’re happy because they got your mind hurt.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught off-marriage in 1987 by a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason why he would not seek to be president himself.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” he told me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and at least one more was needed.
Someone called the situation ‘Lumicious and the Seven Dwarfs.’
Because the campaign time was already long, he was left behind in the fundraiser and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he gets two million dollars in size.
It was a lost battle.
I told him that some of his supporters, who gave thousands of dollars to male candidates, gave him only 250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he came under the influence of his feelings - for his supporters of gratitude, for a system of desperation that made it so difficult to raise funds for voters and not for delegates - that he did not get angry at the election work, and he did not get angry.
“You could have thought I was getting a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my grave water is probably going to be used as a memento.
“She was crying.”
How the U.S. and China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The launch of the U.S.-China trade war was humiliating, and while the fight is all but over, the middle ground can benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China’s main export items, which include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week, the most significant escalation was due to new customs duties affecting import goods for $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded at the same rate each time, lastly by imposing a five-ten percent tariff on U.S. imports worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. in eye-to-eye style, and it doesn’t seem like the world’s second-largest economy is suffocating for a while.
In order for Washington to back down, it should give up on its own demands, but for the U.S. public, the slump would be just too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its card correctly, the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by reducing inter-country dependence.
“A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that start an economic downturn in any country, and this is in fact a more dangerous possibility than the American side-scrollers have so far understood,” said Security quoted Abigail Grace, who is familiar with the Center for Asia.
Syria's foreign minister says the country is "ready" for refugees' return
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country after a devastating war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to repair the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
Circumstances now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic actions aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the UN, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would be grateful for the assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government does not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team in the finals against 16.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe; it has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown on its own when its Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson had difficulty almost throughout the tournament and he hit his starting pitch in the water on the 16th leg of the par-3, giving the game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of the four players who have scored 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth came out with a result of 5&4 Europe's lowest-ranked player, Denmark's Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesenia.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top player, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Of the eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Sergio Garcia became the tournament’s most successful European ever with a total of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do anything about it.
The year has been tough.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get this win.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I could be of help,” Garcia said after the win for the European team.
He transfers the favor to his compatriot Jon Rahmi, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods in the individual games played on Sunday 2&1.
"I feel tremendous pride in winning Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
You’ll see statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big wins and remains second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulty finding the roads all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finauta, whose game was of high quality throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the captain of the U.S. team, said after his team's failed performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We beat the European team this morning in the games.
We got our pans.
Honor to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, working with our American PGA and Ryder Cup committee, and we're moving forward.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
I need to pick up my hat.
We have met our winners.”
