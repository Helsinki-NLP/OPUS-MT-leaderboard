28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
A 28-year-old chef, who had just moved to San Francisco, was found dead this week on the rampage of a local shopping center.
The victim’s brother, however, says he doesn’t know anyone who would have wanted to hurt him, and says, “His affairs were finally going well.”
The body, found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco-born Frank Galicia, San Francisco's death row office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said that the death was defined as a life sentence and that the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO channel in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line cook in Boston, had taken his dream job as a line cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A Sons & Daughters representative said they were "terrified and shocked" at his death.
"We have a small team that works like a tight family, and we will miss him very much," the representative said.
We will send our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank initially stayed in hostels, but that recently "that thing finally went well".
“He found an apartment and met a girl,” Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he did not know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to make us food, make dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of argument.
He was a brother who rode with the power.
“In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a ruthless diamond that shone brighter every day,” he said.
Anyone with any information on the matter will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's whistleblower at 415-575-4444.
Medical Practitioners Cancelled: Requirements for New Work Combative Measures
The representatives of the medical practitioners have asked their trade unions to adopt new anti-labour measures in their dispute regarding the new agreement.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is calling on the entire Council to support new work-related measures starting in September.
The JDC says ministers have not been able to address concerns about the agreement.
Medical practitioners and medical students voted in July to reject a deal that had been agreed with the BMA.
58 per cent of the members who voted rejected it.
On Thursday evening via Twitter, in a letter to members of the JDC, Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “self-assuredly silent” on issues that she said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: “In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the fully proposed new agreement and call for formal renegotiation of all your concerns.”
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council, in order to obtain authorization for a gradually advancing and expanding work-related combat programme beginning in early September.
It has been observed that medical practitioners have participated in six strikes this year, including the first full-time employment in the history of the NHS health care system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the head of BMA’s medical practitioners, resigned after the vote had been rejected on the terms recommended by the BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical practitioners and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the deal will be ordered by English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
Ele, who ended up in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hand each other over and declare the eight-month-long struggle for words and economic sanctions to be officially over.
But in welcoming Vladimir Putin to his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that more is needed in Ankara.
Yeah, we were handcuffed on the occasion.
But Putin’s smile seemed crowded, and he hardly threatened the heat, even according to his own controlled norms.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, was constantly talking about his "loved friend" Putin - five times, according to one report.
I messed up the bills.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to a better one.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his instincts are seemingly opposite.
But the whistle from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara by accusing it of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The injury was even worse when it came from an unlikely friend.
Restructuring real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-run media led to an astonishing, in-depth attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade from the Isis-ruled areas of Syria.
He has strongly denied this.
But the official message in St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin was asked to apologize to President Erdogan.
Russia has achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of settling for Ankara are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost expelled from power in the failed coup d'état last month.
The ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly reassured him.
There is also a financial motive.
Russia’s economic sanctions have been heavy, especially a ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The figure has fallen by almost 90 percent.
As far as Russia is concerned, the local tour operators and order airlines are certainly relieved when the flights finally resume.
They are hoping for a late-season trek to the Mediterranean.
And already this week the state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the import of agricultural products from Turkey is again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as was formulated in the report of the newspaper Vedemosti.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, the West is angry at what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
Adding to this a long-standing fascination with the progress of the EU membership negotiations, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cold and break Turkey’s ties with the West, will emerge.
The Russian leader certainly got the points of departure from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary enterprise to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a survival for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a coup d'état.
So this meeting at the Prama Seafront Palace enabled Russia and Turkey to present an "external alliance", as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that experience the West abandoning them and targeting them incorrectly, combining their power.
However, these two have great disagreements despite the public act of reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently agreed to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It can be said that after nearly three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question regarding their disagreements, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on where they can seek a common ground with regard to Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full disaster when NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that two leaders are even in the middle of a speech.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside of Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is losing customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was part of the bank’s international goals.
After the bank collapsed almost eight years ago and had to save it, it has given up on these goals.
The Bank’s strategies have at this time used the ‘RBS’ brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by the millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come to the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in operation with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, with the exception of head office and stock exchanges, will be converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a customer and staff tour in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will become the employer of our investment brand and our employees, because we will now become a much more branded bank.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“Now is the time to move in the direction of the brand bank, because basically (we’ve asked) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focused on customer needs, not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori Wins at Newmarket with Predilection and Reaches 3000 Wins
The doctor sprays champagne after he has a total of 3000 wins after a double win.
Kilparatist Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He scored his first goal of the night with a second win on his home track in John Gosden's pre-election training competition.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in cycling.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Edder, and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because here I started 30 years ago.
This is not a big event, this is not a Royal Ascot, but a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The doctor sucks his own cock as he farmes for Predilection after the win.
Two cyclists have reached this milestone in hurdles – champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had records of breaking his career with more than 4,300 wins.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best turtle hunters of the present age, and it is no surprise that she has reached this milestone, which few have reached before her.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical ace separates him from the rest of the weight room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans of the species for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have ridden with 6,000 winners if he weren't just a weekend and big-skirt jockey!
Hardly speaking, Frankie has ridden the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for British racing, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with an airplane landing from the saddle, which was made up of a brand.
From flying cessations to flight landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of the British helicopter fleet for two decades.
This has been a mountain road.
Coincidentally, he won in major leagues, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and suffered a competitive ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he had a difficult start on his return after a six-month competitive ban, but he showed significant character in challenging the suspects and returning in his best condition.
And he may go on for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until he is at least 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismisses Russian Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly separated the head of the team, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement said that Putin had "ordered Ivanov to step down from the duties of the head of the Russian presidential administration", but no reason was given.
Since 2012, Ivanov’s assistant director, Anton Vaino, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
She was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the president’s protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin’s website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in the drafting of laws and in the management of the implementation of your directives.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Vain be appointed in his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, worked for the Soviet security service in the KGB.
As a team leader, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a televised meeting with President Putin, the two men claimed that the head of the team withdrew at his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just a descendant of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man, who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate, even suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy, has been accepted in a very dubious manner.
In his comments on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov told Putin, “It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in the discussion to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, perhaps even say at work, task.
Well, now I've been a team manager for four years and eight months."
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service at the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the state security service at the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed its deputy chairman.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian President after the second season of Putin, because the third season of Putin would have been against the Constitution.
This task, however, went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before his return to power.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson gets a shoe after hitting producer
Gibson was last month involved in a physical controversy at the series' filming location in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his separation in a joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, who played Gibson, filed an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes in the place of description.
I’m sorry it happened,” he said in a statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson’s character is removed from the FBI agent team’s storyline can be expected at a later date.
The 54-year-old who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg sitcom has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds series, and I’ve given it everything for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement Friday.
I wish I'd been there until the end, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans that the series can have.
The beginning of the twelfth season of the series is scheduled for 28 September.
Mysterious fish ended up in the garden at Banff
The man in Banff has asked for help identifying the fish that have emerged in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windy fish that the waterwheel has left behind.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material from the apparition in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch-sized fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have combined the north bank of the Queensferry crossing with the mainland, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four locks between the "carrier beams" that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
Fifesta is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 gravel.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the country today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are all witnessing a truly impressive engineering work on this project, which has used over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge.”
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, finishing the bridge between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme precise measurements must be matched.
In total, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the last part of the deck deck is lying today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this closure represents the pinnacle of building technology.
After the last part of the road had been installed and connected to the expanding north pole supply, we then had to close the remaining part on the north side, i.e. the inland side.
This was done by dragging the northern lane from the ground 700 mm southwards.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Huge, because the land is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled about 3% in the angle of inclination.
Required, because the allowed gauges, according to which the team worked, were small, only a few millimeters in either direction.
Fortunately, however, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after falling off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue vessel made an alert at 1.20 p.m. (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event unfold at Moelfre Bay.
Three men were desperately trying to swim safely on their boat as they continued on to themselves.
“We saw the boat circled closer to the men and imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, a rescuer from Moelfren.
“Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got into motion,” he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two men, and a third, a 60-year-old man, was found floating in a ditch without lifeguards.
The men were taken to the coast rescue boat and brought back to the rescue ship station.
Jones said: “These three men who have fallen into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had a fatal crash, but it had somehow separated the boat from the person driving it when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a Respectable Pursuit of Health and Happiness
It’s interesting to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but that they prefer to spend their free time watching the screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the couch and participate in some activity.
The screen time was initially limited to television, then to video games, and more recently to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not shut down each other.
This is, of course, a wildcard called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later produced cartoons, game cards, and other sequels).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat dilute before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Since then, the release of the game in other countries has been delayed, as huge popularity overloaded servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
Explained in the core shell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS, and that can then be "photographed" (using the phone's screen capture) or "switched".
The gender that played the game at a younger age has joined the wild and jumped up from the couch according to searches.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the "average person" daily steps.
Apple Watch’s Cardiogram app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent in Cardiogram’s followers.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees training level information.
The calls of many public health campaigns to "find 30", "lift the couch" and "be active every day" have not produced any results because most of the public health benefits are boring and cared for by people who seem to be unhappy.
However, the importance of the movement cannot be diminished.
People who move regularly have a lower risk of getting cancer or depression.
The activity helps in weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.
Some people even get new friends when hunting.
As usual, disgruntled cheerleaders are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk through the door.
What's that?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although previously there were apps like Fitbit that could track activity, they did not give a reason to move in the same way as this game.
The novelty fades and the use fades in time.
However, due to the success of the Pokémon, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with the activity of the real world, helping many hunters to be more active, in better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles captures gold in women's multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget about public space.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
Energetic jump.
With smooth poms.
Unbelievable permanence.
Brilliant everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast reached the multi-stakeholder championship on Thursday, leaving himself and the end of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
His overall score, 62,198, was clearly better than the silver medallist and the "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win the multi-racial championship in a row, and the fifth American champion in all, while consolidating her reputation with her generation, and perhaps of all time, as the best.
He burst into tears when his final points were announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement elevates him to the same category as other top athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised his species to a new level:
Biles has managed his species for the last three years to win 15 World Championships, including 10 golds, with programs whose combination of ambition and accuracy has been so amazing that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best I could see".
The last test was expected in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning home to Texas Spring without the horny gold medallions would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Aly Raisman, after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the women's multi-stakeholder competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, elo.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he acted as a top scorer at the starting party of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
While Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future as he travels a long way to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program - which includes his trademark voltiohitus - has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also fit in nicely on the street next to the Rio Olympics arena.
This is no coincidence.
From this girl, adopted by her grandparents as a tauper, and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a study trip in the hall where Boorman was trained, has become a force majeure.
He hasn’t lost in a multiplayer game since summer 2013, and this winning streak continues as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just a false picture.
The balance tree and the permanence in which Biles is the reigning world champion awaited.
He rose to the top with 15,433 points and surpassed them with 15,933 standings.
Raisman hugged him in a benevolent manner as they waited for the finale - just formality - and the tears rose to Biles's glittery, white and blue limited eyes when the dream he once wrote about in his play came true.
Raisman's performance was a kind of rematch four years ago when he was split in third place, but lost to the Frenchman in a rematch.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call “grandmother,” was clearly in charge.
He sent airbags to the public after his permanence performance in a moody return, which in the meantime seemed questionable.
As for Bilesi, this wide-spread tweet from the 19-year-old earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial murder were shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot in Phoenix’s deadliest serial killer attack in the last decade, according to a police report released on Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis’ daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on June 12.
The report says that the gunman standing on the side of the passenger of the car fired up to eight times and then fled with another vehicle.
According to the police, the three deaths do not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take his handbags or the $2,900 that was spent on another adult victim.
A Phoenix police official, Colonel Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to see if it was related to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks over the course of four months, which have been carried out in two major Latin American cities.
“These are happening in the residential area in front of the home,” Howard told CBS’s subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the brown Nissan of the late 1990s, the black BMW of the late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers have not agreed to disclose the evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related to each other and are done by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was admitted to the hospital where he later died due to injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The eyewitness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police statement about the shooting, which took place just half an hour before the third death and was aimed at an empty car, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The researchers found the crevices of the hoods, the seat of the hood, and the fragments of the hood.
6-year-old mother with microcephaly: “The situation is getting easier”
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-minded, a consequence of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
“When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn’t do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do that.
Which is not true at all - I certainly promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the care of the facility.
“My initial reaction was that ‘I didn’t know people were still doing it,’” Picciuto explained.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or rob until he was three years old, and he still doesn't speak.
But he's slowly reaching some ridges.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows you how Edmund's incoherently invented the reference to "you've lied to me."
“We’ll teach him a reference language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not an ordinary reference language - he says that Edmund has invented some of his own references.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of reasons: genetic, such as in the case of Edmund, or gestational viral infections, such as measles or Zika virus.
The symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those who have contracted Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden caused by the uncertain future.
I was just wondering what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he doesn't really know yet.
In fact, I haven’t asked for a prediction in time, because I don’t expect anyone to be able to actually give it to me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It's getting easier.
You can believe that the situation will be easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Hurricanes and Floods Caused Rescue Operations in Mississippi, Louisiana
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana caused the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded over their cores and caused widespread flooding due to extreme heavy rains, according to the National Weather Service.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said the state authorities are constantly in touch with local authorities, and that aid is already coming to the counties that need it.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office for Security and Emergency Preparedness, said they would receive requests for vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa district alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The Fire Department is in effect until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that additional rain will be expected in the region from three to five cents.
In southern Alabama, the floodgates were in effect on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River that flows near Baton Rouge and the Amite River that flows near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set a flood peak during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said the threat is lower than the flooding of the Ascension district along the river, as flooding rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, was the highest level of all time at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers are still picking up people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and son-in-law were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
62-year-old Hansford says that normally over 400 feet away from his home, Beaver Creek’s water rose rapidly during the night.
He says the other side of the boy who lived nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just continued to rise," Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she had not seen the water so high during the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family all have injuries, and that he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the rescue workers rescued the three in a large, army-style truck and took them to Gloster Fire Station, where the rescuers stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that the floods “spread rapidly across” as heavy rains continue, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely saturated with heavy rain, which continued from Wednesday.
The flooding of the riverbed and streets led to the rescue of the residents of Tangipahoa district from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
CBS’s subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the city council in Tangipaho said 200 homes remained under the flood.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now under flood.
The county's president, Robby Miller, said the authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets who had been left stranded on the island.
Amites and Hammond towns have been opened to protect those who have been evacuated.
"They can go back to their homes when the water starts to drop," he said.
In the town of Hammond, in the Tangipaho district, twenty streets were closed due to rising water, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrative authority.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, the emergency chief of Harrison County, Rupert Lacy, said the steady rain continued along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to be flooded, but so far Friday no flood incidents have been reported.
Keith Townson, the head of Shopper Value Foods, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and the rain continues.”
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown 'full of bullets' survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shot in the city this week.
The child's parents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown received multiple gunshot wounds to his limbs, legs, hands, and stomach, but he was aware when he was transferred to the hospital.
“He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bones,” the boy’s grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical, and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first class at a local secondary school.
Brown was one of four shots fired at Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be shooters.
The researchers tell CBS Philadelphia that it looks like there was a cross between several shooters at the scene.
The attack weapon-type rifles, which come from a variety of attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that this was a constant struggle.
On the street there were stalls on both sides of the walkway.
“So it looks like there were a lot of armed fighters here, and they were in active combat,” Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information obtained, the police are investigating the tapes of the surveillance chamber.
Another six-year-old, a girl, got a stroke in her hand Tuesday when she was playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby, and Lauriet
So I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls, are on the team.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, after all, from America.
It has also established itself at the top of the species of dark-skinned and Latin American women.
For the past four years, the most successful female rapist has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was surprised as an Olympic champion, and America was horrified.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible achievements of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they present unexpected but masterful empowerment programs.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American woman to have successively won the individual gold in the women's multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got the silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation doesn't look like this in gyms all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all walked the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (the last five) because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts, and this will be Marta Karoli's final year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive breed, and gymnastics practitioners generally practice in private gymnastics licenses maintained by parents who pay for training, spaces, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for trainers and their gymnastics) and their gymnastics classes.
A large part of these powerhouses are located in rich suburban outlying areas that can support species.
With these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to gymnasts’ families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started training.
We need to bring more affordable and available empowerment training to communities where Simone, Gabby and Laurie are inspired by the many young girls.
I founded my foundation 20 years ago.
In my organization, we have provided free and affordable training in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly blacks and Latinos) and have trained national and international masters.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (hometown) to provide high-quality training for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic species.
The gymnasts develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the rigidity, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health as well as for school and work success.
This inspiration for the team gets thousands of young girls to start strengthening, and it’s great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious “girl power” by winning the Olympic team, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young people.
Medical Practitioners Organizing New Lawsuits After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt's Proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the controversy by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37,000 medical practitioners who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying that the NHS was on "unknown ground", and that even minor additional delays would harm staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA's Medical Practitioners Committee, said last night in a statement: "Physical practitioners still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it will accelerate the current labour crisis, and that there will be no confusion at all."
When the time before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new contract is only eight weeks, progress must be made and the time is running out.
BMA’s attempts to resolve disputes through negotiations have been met with the government’s unwillingness to participate and from time to time with deep silence.
However, despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt is going to act now, remove the compulsion, and take into account the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he does not do so, the medical practitioners are ready to continue the work struggle.
At the end of April, the last strike meant the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 receptionists, when nurses and doctors consulted were recruited to serve as substitutes for doctors in the strike ward.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 contract-based medical practitioners.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of the NHS Employers Association, appealed to medical practitioners so they don’t go to jail.
Mortimer said: “Work struggles are very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause worry, anxiety and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of surveillance (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that a continuous positive debate on other important topics such as development, flexibility in education, additional education, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, free movement of pupils and gender, health care and the environment, etc.
Two pounds of medicine a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds a day of the medicine after authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
A medicine to prevent blood clotting, ticagrelor, lowers the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given as early as 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or other conditions.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to continue to calculate the risk of heart and blood problems.
But now NHS supervisors NICE have advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to still be able to calculate the risk of heart and blood problems.
About 140,000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them get a second stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fat accumulated in the wall of the state, which forms narrowings.
If the narrowing cracks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood circulation to the heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can pass along the blood and interrupt the blood circulation to the brain causing a stroke.
People who have already received one shot have an increased risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making seizures less likely.
The draft guideline for NICE, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of NICE’s Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: “Despite the availability of effective preventative treatments, up to a quarter of people who get a heart attack later get a second heart attack or stroke from the side of the brain.”
The fear of regeneration can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we initially recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add the available treatment options to thousands of people who might benefit from it.
Given that data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly regarding the risk of bleeding - are limited over a period of more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend treatment for longer than during this period.
The culture of political correctness allows for the flourishing of the electoral fold in Muslim regions
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, prompting a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the widespread lack of attention in Muslim communities, as revealed in today’s shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles warned police, election watchdogs and city authorities that they have ignored the evidence of the election campaign because of “racial and religious hypersensitivity.”
The former Community Secretary, the current Emperor of Anti-Corruption, said that the fear of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set up security chains to protect those who were afraid of polling stations.
He recommends that voters should present a certificate of identity when voting in order to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even suggests that an indelible ink be placed on the finger of the voting person so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls on the press to have greater access to the documents and decisions of the delegation that have been taken by the informal committees or the working group.
"This would not only protect the electoral fold, but it would protect the local government from a broader culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with the electoral fold," he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the East London Tower Hamlets voting scandal.
Last year, the special election court ruled that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous allegations of corruption and illegal activities.
The court noted Rahman’s “demandingly distorted” religious sentiments in his Muslim community, as well as his silent critic’s accusations of racism and Islamism.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were guessing or the result of a person voting for someone else.
Sir Eric said that the evidence of the mole can be found all over the country.
He was particularly concerned by the election campaign in a vote in which members of the high-ranking Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations on cleaning up the voting system, including identity verification with a personal ID
He said: “The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of communities of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in those communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
“There was concern that ... the state institutions had ignored such behavior ‘politically correct’ because of race and religious hypersensitivity.”
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists being allowed to deal with ballots that have been mailed in order to end 'vote collection'.
The report, which Theresa May is reviewing, also calls for tougher revisions for registered voters in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Check the options for verifying the identity of the voters before you vote.
Use the finger of the person who votes the indelible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Make systematic national checks to ensure that they are eligible to vote. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic mail-to-vote voting.
Prevent political activists from dealing with ready-made voices and envelopes that come through the mail, in which the voices are sent.
Let the police set up security chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to blame people for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make the photograph illegal at polling stations.
Requires only English (except in Wales) to be used at polling stations.
Confirm the training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that the voter must go to the polls alone.
Sir Eric teases the Greater London police force by saying that it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been raised since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court stayed in Lutfur Rahman and his officials as a result of numerous corruption and illegal actions,” he said.
On the basis of numerous grounds, he was found guilty without a doubt, according to the criminal evidence.
He also criticized ineffective "several check-ups" in the polling stations of the city council.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets trial was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a splendid legacy as the birthplace of parliaments, but this disturbing and mysterious spread of electoral discord and the denial of the facts of certain groups threaten this good reputation."
Crazy Kate on a bicyclist's double flight and other celebrity appearances at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone crazy about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be an impressive double flight of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete to fight for gold this summer, who can cheer on his own famous double-crossing - at least according to social media.
So in honor of Rio’s kites and all the famous faces on our screens right now, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's rowing team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to the double existence of Kate from the bike wheel, many people online have been quick to notice how a certain rider could be a star of Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's basketball team, has caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures surfaced, in which he appears to be as scary as The Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, when he became aware of the excitement of social media, the hippie admitted that he had heard about Leo since he was a child.
“I don’t see a great deal of similarity, except for maybe a couple,” Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is politeness."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will surely emerge this year as well: the shocking similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian singer Alya Mustafina is said to be the great, expressive eye of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan's double presence.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger change in the eye: According to this user, Nathan is the "sports version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medallist Yulia Efimova has more of the same actor as Annalynne McCord with browned skin and light hair, while US team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of the "sporty version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Hard Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others also saw the similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity between the pair
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that “others on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the American football star and the actress Dexter really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold-meter-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautifully-wide smile matches Bring It On -star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic Commentator Apologizes for Saying Chinese Swimmer ‘Dead as a Pig’
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s 4x200-meter freestyle message angered viewers of CBC’s live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its whistleblowers said during the crash that a 14-year-old Chinese female shark “lost like a bad smell” and “dead like a pig.”
Composer Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started sharing some of his own opinions in the women’s 4x200 metre relay final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's intelligence team to bring "color", was heard to say, "That little 14-year-old from China, your belly, baby.
Too excited, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese student Ai Yanhan, 14, sailed the message for the second half 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC whistleblower just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer ‘died like a pig’???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on a direct mission."
China's Ai Yanhani was described in the women's 4 x 200 metre freestyle finale as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China, your belly, baby."
Reviewing Byron MacDonald on Twitter was tough and fast, as many challenged him.
Twitter users did not hold themselves to hearing how ruthless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound racist.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who ran the CBC broadcast, apologized in a live broadcast for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We're sorry that a comment about the swim performance was sent.
It was a regrettable choice of words, we are sorry that this happened.”
The CBC has apologised more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment.
Detective Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and added an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and issued an opinion.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
We quickly took action last night and apologized directly to our viewers and our followers on social media for the message we received.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and regrettable choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for his message.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said at the CBC Olympics.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person."
“It seems unnecessary to say that I didn’t mean it disrespectful, and that I’m really sorry.”
Primark’s customer sneezed at a woman who sneered at the bottom of the store
Customers didn’t know what to look at when a woman got up in the middle of Primark’s movement to try on underwear.
Things didn’t improve by assessing what she looked like in the pants, the woman peeled them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued the tour and eventually agreed on four pair of underwear at the store, which was located at Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone.
Primark's movement at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman agreed on underwear and then put them back on the shelf
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children in the store, said that after experimenting with underwear, the mysterious woman “dressed again and walked away from the store without buying anything.”
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the shop floor, took a pair of underpants on display, stripped her own socks and underwear, and put the matching shoes on her feet.
"He didn't even try to find a secluded place to settle, he just stood there unscathed."
"They all looked when he took off his underpants and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding that he didn’t like anything, dressed again, and walked out.
“He didn’t seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he agreed to.”
Davidson, 33, of Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn’t been cleaned.”
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I said that the staff apparently tried to remove the pieces of clothing from the sale after the woman left, which is really good.”
“It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and stripped them off, and they haven’t been washed.”
A Primark representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place during the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from sale.”
This is how you can defend yourself against armed attacks by using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrach, the grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with hanging thieves in the vicinity.
We then approached you in front or behind, this video shows you how you can pay the attacker in the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, you first have to turn around to see your attacker and "raise the line of fire".
You will then catch a gun between your elbow and shoulder before you hit the attacker on the face with your free elbow.
Continue to hit the knee in the nostrils, and as the attacker goes from pain to pain, turn the weapon out of his hands, hit him on the back of the gun on the face and back, keeping the weapon directed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab a gun and turn it around so that the criminal is unable to fire.
At the same time put the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon away from him, turn back and point him with the weapon.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video on how Mizrachi exactly does this.
But remember, if you're not the grandmaster of Krav Maga, the safest way to get out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright sculpts Europe’s dirtiest places to travel
The British explorer has set a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflexes by squeezing some of Europe’s most sleazy and nightly places.
Ian Wright, 51, a Suffolk-based smuggler and travel writer, would drop a euro note, a leak at the Piccadilly Circus, a train wash button, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before lowering each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was in.
The experiment, from which a film called Inner Power was made, however, produced surprising results.
The idea of lowering the washing-up button used by thousands of people may seem completely contradictory, but in fact, the kitchen countertop has more bad bacteria.
On his way across Europe, Wright was constantly talking to doctors and medical professionals about the strengthening of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his nails left him any more bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became well-known as a tester of sustainability in his travels around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
This task, ranging from public railway stations to the toilet seat flush button, was indeed a test of his immune system.
In the film, he said, “Since I was a kid, I’ve been pretty worried about my health, and I’ve put all sorts of things in my mouth from the soil, the soil, and the dirty water.”
He really confirmed his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
In his exhibition, there were more than 4,000 units in the photometry.
For comparison, the reading of the washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public visit, he did not agree to go down when the result of the photometer showed more than 4000 units, and the result of the washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist film, with traces of Inner Power, along with a Finnish mejer, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom.
In the movie, she said, "This is almost the worst thing I've smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty!
I'm not going to give you anything, 'cause there's a place to stay.
The traces of internal power were produced together with the Finnish miller, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, which help to enhance people’s gut bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, the director of Valio’s snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be interesting to look at, and that would explain the benefits of probiotics at the same time.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up thinking, "Let's call Ian."
They argue that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell our everyday environment about good and bad bacteria, the importance of gut health and its connection to the immune system.
An increasing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we can tell more about it in an interesting way to consumers.
I think the document also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the documentary, added: “Let’s just say it this way: if Ian had stolen some of the things I asked him, such as the Russian night-walker shown in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him.”
Understandably, some of the craziest things were easier for Ian, while some were quite difficult.
I’m glad we got some of those dirty tracks recorded.”
In a poll conducted in 2015, 84 percent of respondents combined lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products that have been added to lactic acid bacteria.
The <0xC3><0x96>ykk<0xC3><0xA4>ri family destroyed a rented house in Cornwall, Saltash, before the wedding
The <0xC3><0x96>ykk<0xC3><0xA4>ri family caused damage to their rented house of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 after they were vilified for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Keldo and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall's Saltash since they were complained several times.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, the shocked staff of the housing company found that the property was in poor condition.
The walls had been made of blasting holes, the floor slabs had been torn, the waste had been spread to the floor, and the walls had been destroyed by graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private housing.
Conna McEvoy, the owner of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said: “This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don’t think people should have to live this way.
There are a lot of things to think about here, because this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is corrupt, and their name is corrupt.”
The couple had three boys who lived in the property between them, and police said the family’s fear included street fighting at the beachside, fear of close residents, drug use, drug sales, and utter shouting, fighting, and cursing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, received a decision in June on the unsocial behaviour.
Many of the rooms of the house below the demolition threshold were found old waste.
The property, from which drugs have previously been smuggled, had floor coverings plastered up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were regularly called to the scene.
Cornwall Housing strongly canceled the property of a woman and this partner this week after giving them an extended period of time, 11 weeks, to change voluntarily.
The comrade neighbors thanked the wedding, saying that their lives had become as hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anybody."
We lived in their neighborhood for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
“We didn’t get any sleep this morning.
We grew up here because it was so quiet - we're not used to it!
It's great now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family had not cooperated with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property
The trash and old toys have been thrown down on the wall of the rented house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident took no responsibility for his or her own and family's conduct, as voting is always the last procedure that Cornwall Housing has considered.
This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme, and their actions would surely have terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police, and the courageous community members who have given us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
A dirty bed left on the floor of a single bedroom after the marriage

Tourists in Portugal were appalled when a military jet flew to the beach on a low hip
Previous articleSun worshippers in Portugal’s Aviros experienced a shock in their lives
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane would wipe out really low
The Air Force said that it was a training flight and claimed that the safety was not compromised.
At this very moment, frightened tourists began to be disturbed when a low-flying shower machine would wipe over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military plane came close to contact with the sun worshippers on the sand dunes in Aveiros, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up as they began to understandably worry about the metal in the shower, even though they did not initially see what was behind the clouds were coming towards them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic overflight on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: “It went through twice as low, and at one point it looked like it was collapsing on the ground.”
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it really felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aviros were horrified when the plane appeared from the dark and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight intended to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown considerably lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby land fires, but the air force assured that no one’s safety was in jeopardy.
This summer, land fires have destroyed parts of Manner-Portugal, and four people have been killed on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low visibility due to the conditions, the smoke caused by the land fires and the thick fog,
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
The results of the first half of the year are expected to be better
The Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksote) made a better result in January - in June, EUR 3.4 million.
The result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to break down plant care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Exote aims to shorten the lines of action.
Exote covers the surplus by exceeding the previously generated deficit.
The remaining portion may be used to reduce edema and purchase measures for patients.
The result of the whole year is expected to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
The Eksote government will discuss the half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Guards Sworn to Immolas Soldier
The 70 crew members of the Border and Coast Guard School were sworn in as soldiers on Friday.
The military meeting of the border and naval school’s armed forces was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Cross-Border Course was held in the sports field of the team.
The soldier was sworn in by 70 crew members.
Special border guards are trained in demanding border security, intelligence, and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special border doctor.
250 of them were invited to the elections.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting, which took place in connection with the election, was attended by five veterans of the border forces during the war.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans to take part in the event were born in 1918.
A bit of rubbish above - a criminal investigation to help solve crimes and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police stations in Finland has operated an RTA, a crime investigation and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The H<0xC3><0xA4>me police station comprises a total of four police officers in Lahti and H<0xC3><0xA4>meenlinna.
It's drawn by the superintendent in Lahti.
Commissioner Lahti is the Chief of Staff.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in H<0xC3><0xA4>meenlinna.
They all work in the civil service.
The unit has demonstrated its usability and necessity, according to Assistant Police Chief Tero Sepp<0xC3><0xA4>nen.
The RTA unit will produce a variety of reports to other police.
It has, among other things, gained information about asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e., the fact that the police were more and more rarely leaving the pills on the spot only after receiving an alert.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will focus on the day-to-day police activities where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one crime investigation centre was established in the country, under it three national units and each police station its own crime investigation unit.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in the context of the Central Crime Police, operates nationally.
In PTR units, people from the Police, Customs and Border Patrol work in accordance with their name.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas that are divided according to the police authorities, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
The investigation extends beyond its own territory.
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour workweek, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police station.
The investigation also extends beyond the limits of its own institution, because it does so in a criminal way.
Those working in the RTA unit have better skills in the basic policies.
The unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, product-related crimes or similar crimes, using registers, alert task data and observations.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal prosecution.
Everyone has their own way of acting.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on what you do, a certain image is created.
Sorting can be done on the basis of either the perpetrator or the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
Workers of the RTA unit do not ride the city rails upright, but their work is not completely public.
Neither the own nor the methods used by criminals are explained, as this could lead to the professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent the crime prevention companies of the police.
The police will inform the public about the methods if it foresees the threat to them.
Such a case had, for example, been updated from the beginning of the year, the marking of empty dwellings used in residential demolitions.
It’s where the actors put a fork, buttonhole, or tapestries on the outside of the apartment, trying to see if the residents are really on the go.
The presentation material shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The unit of analysis has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
For example, you may find that fingerprints have been found on the site, and you can order a copyrighted protocol.
Next time, we’re going to steal our clothes.
Deputy Police Chief Tero Sepp<0xC3><0xA4> from H<0xC3><0xA4>meen Police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepoloa from Eastern Finland Police, Commissioner Sami Joutj<0xC3><0xA4>rve from Joensuu Police Station and Inspector Arto Tuomela from Central Finland Police.
The police will collect and analyse information that will allow them to plan practical activities.
In the background, the amount of labour and finance will decrease.
The first steps towards a new way of doing things were already taken 30 years ago.
The last change was a three-stage PARA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation will collect information from outside of your own institution and the borders of Finland.
Father-in-law schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join Isis, has reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasname Akunjee said that the girl’s family heard this dead in Syria’s Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian expression in Raqqa, which is the organization’s base in the country.
Sultana was 17, and, according to his family, he died just as he was planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“It can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and testament to others that going to the war zone involves real risks – that it could cause people to give up making such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East Turkish schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family was told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow only a few months later.
Reid says Clinton will hold Garland as the Supreme Court candidate if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect a person to replace former Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia.
Reid said in a phone call on Thursday that he was predicting "somewhat sure" that Clinton would choose Garland.
A Reid representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland, and that there was speculation.
He congratulated Garland and said Clinton’s team would not want to “swallow the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans who block Garland's nomination are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "behaviors" and "opportunities."
He said Trump was not in office.
Treats says that the nude calendar is "as for women as for men"
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli for 2017.
But instead of the nude celebrities, they plan to find the next top model generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The president of the Treats, Steve Shaw, told us earlier this year that his magazine, which contains a lot of nudes, is different from the old school playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them.
“We need to start again presenting a timeless and classic nudity in which women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of naked womanhood,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Models can leave photos online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The purpose of vinyl: who actually buys the records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you attempt to fill in the comment section with irritating violations, the author of which is labeled NoAllSingle Middle-Aged Men, you will notice that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of much-talked records is not due to the fact that more and more people born this millennium are excited about the renewal of physical objects, but rather the mid-life chaos.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl record are most likely to be 45-54 years old.
In fact, of all the most unlikely records purchased by the 18-24-year-olds belong to the group.
It is also not just a question of the collection of enthusiasts, but it includes a hallmark: older vinyl buyers are a little more likely to keep their feelings in mind (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do you think youGov's results are correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing an undemanding gray dress. I would vibrate loudly before I stopped, form a cup in my hands and say something valuable, such as: "Let's investigate the matter."
Let's take a closer look.
At the same time, as Soho’s attraction and garbage are slowly being removed – hotels, chain restaurants and shops, as well as office supplies stores now fill buildings that used to have independent movements – a handful of great specialty record stores remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment, as I stand very close to the different men in some of these shops trying to assess their age and emotional temperament.
The Glasgow-based Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (the scorer: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (the scorer: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her twenties), spends her afternoon in London to spend the afternoon in the changing and falling out of the streets of London.
I wonder if he's a collector.
“I am too,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (he sent a sample by email, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly due to his available income: now he can buy records he didn’t have a spare for when they were originally released, and he can buy back those he sold when he was young and cashless.
“A large part of the material I bought is from the late 60’s and early 70’s, records that were released when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to acquire,” he says.
He agrees that album buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: “I don’t smoke or drink a lot.
This is my bad."
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers she meets fit into her YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media. People who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and who have become in need of buying back their old records.
On the basis of the discussions I have had, people have generally been deprived of their totality in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their discs back,” he says.
This may explain an increase in the number of vinyl fertilizers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged hallmarks of the records?
In a store like Phoneca, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comfortable community for like-minded people.
According to Wezi, some of the older customers have been hurt, especially by the close-up payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be puzzled by the digital world and choose to rely on the durability of familiar album covers; items that evoke the memories of the teenage years.
“I think sometimes it can be about filling the hole or some kind of comfort that ownership of objects creates,” Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it to be true for many people.
It is an easy way to fill your thoughts.
“We’re like their social workers!” another employee said suddenly from the top of the record.
The April ICM opinion poll revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% do not have a record player when buying vinyls.
At this point, the news report seems likely to be a serious concern in my browsing of the stack of bossa nova collections.
This “reward” perspective of the awakening is something that Jonny, 42, who also works in Sounds of the Universe (the calculator: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
“Someone came in a while ago and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a big deal, but it definitely happens.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not the older people, but the younger people, the late-teens, who are just getting excited about it.
In Foppa, where today there is almost a whole layer reserved for vinyl, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys, and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than the aforementioned movements - chanting freshly from Wild Beast's fresh synth and sex-filled pop, and not improvisation jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but the psychological trauma of filming is difficult to prove to be true by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes watching the various records on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn’t earn much, so collecting records isn’t really an option.
"It's expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is...” he craves lovingly.
"I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time as I was trying to make it look like I was studying jeans shorts, I noticed a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a moment before my father and daughter were thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac discs: a mix of contemporary music and classics, any of the essential discs in the mid-range collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just ornaments, and some are so high that touching them would be impossible.
It’s all about “artistic styles.”
But given that even the slightest consideration of these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho’s cancer clinics to seek more, there is not much to complain about.
It comes as no surprise that the population with more time and money is also the one that spends the most on luxury items, such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate at least in Soho’s record stores, they don’t rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard in school or in the office.
They don’t really spend their Thursday mornings hustling around Berwick Street record stores browsing records and avoiding the harsh, 30-year-old reality television presenter’s gaze over the shoulders of undetected middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
The researchers say that the holster has a longer lifespan than any other planet on the spine.
Injured researcher Julius Nielsen says the record is for a woman believed to be between 272 and 512 years old who is five meters long.
French court rejects application for dismantling of trade in Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected an application by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to break down a total of 72 temporary shops where people sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea at a rate of 50 cents apiece (40 cents apiece).
The Office of the Prefect of Calais argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent taxes on the unpaid parallel economy and because they represent a fire and clean-up risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital in saying that free meals offered by a state-supported organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free meals to those who need them.
The court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for the destruction of the 72 people who were making temporary purchases, but said the prefect’s concern was “completely understandable.”
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants had a much larger role than just feeding people who were “in extreme uncertainty.”
He said that the premises offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the tear-off era was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, a non-profit camp that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, as well as security vehicles for the camp's hundreds of vulnerable, lonely underage people.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s coffee.
A letter sent to the Guardian said closing the cafe “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle camps has risen to 9,000 - to peak - after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
The price of food in Finland is falling much faster than in the EU on average
In Finland, food is cheap for the pleasure of consumers and for the harm of producers.
The price of food in Finland has dropped by almost five per cent in three years, with the average price in EU countries dropping by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one per cent more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen to the second most in the EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
In the UK alone, the price of food has dropped faster than in Finland.
The data will be published by Statistics Finland’s Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen in a paper published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
The magazine compared real prices, i.e. prices that are relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices rose close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price interest that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The price is now under pressure from the Russian food import bans, which have disrupted food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
The tightening price competition between industry and trade has also affected the price drop.
The S-Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as a visible advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not a fan of affordable food, although the price of food has fallen a lot.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU country in Finland, with a similar wage level to that in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on value added tax.
He found that if the benchmark had the same value added tax rate, Finland would sell the third-cheapest food from the same countries.
The magazine compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the value added tax rate were seven in the comparison countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
“If we want to get to the level of the old EU countries at the price of food, the value added tax must be halved to the middle level of the EU countries and continue the price competition,” Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen notes that the calculations he made with the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
You may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
This is a guide that will be delivered to all schools in Finland.
Schools decide for themselves the details, but the plan tells the official objectives.
New instructions have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old instructions in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of fine writing is abandoned, and instead, coding is practiced in schools.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies are started in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher was teaching students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
In this way, school attendance is trying to make it more interesting.
World's longest-lived spinal cord found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
The coldest known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It may live another 250 years, according to a new study.
The figures make the species the oldest spine in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic doll, whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenlandic haze extends along the North Atlantic.
They also have a second record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch dogs longer, they can grow to more than five meters.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to the surveys only about a centimeter per year, the adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen, from the University of Copenhagen, took note of his colleagues.
He identified two of the 28 women in adult ice sheets who had been left to fish.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon restriction of the lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish, 493 and 502 centimetres of amazon, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Because previous studies have found that ice-cream cones reach sexual maturity at just over a quarter of a metre, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at the time.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired at nearly 300 - sales are not reduced
Nearly 300 employees are dismissed from the warehouse company Stockmann.
In the event of difficulties, the joint ventures ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, the majority of which will be carried out as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of sellers of warehouses will not be reduced in order to avoid suffering from customer service.
In addition, about 80 support services workers are offered a new job as a salesman.
Stockmann's core negotiations involved some 3,000 employees.
At the beginning of this period, it was estimated that there were around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is aimed at an annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are to be realized over the next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme with the aim of saving <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million this year.
There are Stockmann's difficulties in getting profitable from the store.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating profit improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the retail trade is still losing.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Managing Director of Stockmann, sales in warehouses have not met the objectives set by the company.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail has a positive business result in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
On the basis of the second quarter’s performance improvement, Lindex’s clothing chain was particularly successful.
The chain achieved its best sales and results in the second quarter of all time.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating profit was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s turnover this year will shrink from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be somewhat positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - the temperature is below 20 degrees all over the country
The low-pressure center on the northern part of Finland will hold the weather on a rainy Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona L<0xC3><0xA1>ng.
There will also be rain showers in the central part of the country, but the southern part is muddy.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury stays below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the northern wetlands it is 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team is concerned about the doping scandal – a strange explanation for the coach’s temperament
Kenyan general sport coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in the doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete in which Anzrah tried to perform is 800 meters star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arab Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he had given the Rotichin sample in a surprise test.
Doping officials went to the Anzrah authorities to report it.
Anzrah was sent home, he said, because he "made his crime against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour,” Kip Keino, the chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, told Reuters.
The Olympic general sport starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich placed fourth in last year’s World Cup and is ahead of Rio’s winning favourites.
According to Reuters, a source within the Kenyan general sports team claimed that Anzrah only ran the athlete’s accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to reveal himself,” the source said.
Where's everybody?
Rio's Sports Stadium Is Empty
Where is everything right?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to follow the general sport.
In Rio on Friday, a battle on the dimensions of public sports began, but the world’s elites were able to present their skills to the naked eye.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day’s morning evening tickets and 65 percent of the evening’s evening tickets have been sold.
Another was four years ago in London, where the stadium was littered with a ferocious crowd.
Tickets for the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
Rio’s Olympic spectators have already attracted attention before the general sport.
For example, spectators of rugby, melon and horseback riding have seen thousands of empty benches.
When Brazil’s medalists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the stadium was filled with spectators.
After the Brazilian boxing match, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12,000 people watched.
Poor runners explain, at least, that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian racing enthusiasts, and many of the Olympic games are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not get the stadium to be filled with water.
Mario Andrada, a whistleblower’s spokesman, said on weekends that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
“There are still 1.1 million remaining for sale,” Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million Olympic flags in London, 8.2 million were sold, although the flags cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 to over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 for those who opened.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
Volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats at the London Olympics, but this has not yet been allowed in Rio, as organizers need money and are trying to get tickets to sell until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to less well-known species, such as golf and rugby, to schoolchildren in the country.
There were plenty of empty seats in Rio’s stadium in the morning.
Even the beach volleyball in the Copacabana sand has no interest in the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.

A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation in the latest ways.
The foundation, which was founded last year, acquires ecologically important natural areas for its ownership.
After that, private individuals, businesses and communities can redeem with money holding rights to the territory.
The foundation has acquired its first land area from Lapland.
The land area is divided virtually into blocks that you want to be able to acquire for a royalty payment.
The holder receives a veto right of 187 square blocks, which in practice means that no approval is required from each holder if the land use purpose is to be changed.
Administrative rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
The acquisition of administrative rights is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or given as a gift.
You don’t have to go to carry banners or hang yourself somewhere to protect nature,” says Juha Levi<0xC3><0xA4>kangas, who acquired the rights to his company.
The administrative authority acquires precise location information from its block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the name data of the holders of the rights are compiled in the same map from which the block data of the territory can be found.
Lev<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>kanas sees its acquisition of natural protection as a risk only that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a charitable foundation with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation will act somewhat unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is to protect natural areas so that they can be untouched and peaceful.
The foundation acquires land areas either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly with the sale of holding rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more countries of protection.
It also targets outside Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Trade Fair on August 13-19.
Bike sheds torment large cities with the worst in Turku - see your home town situation
Bicycle helmets are the worst in Finland’s major cities.
This year, there have been more rounds stolen compared to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
Based on the bicycle thefts reported to the police, Helsinki’s Sanomat found out the proportion of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year and their parts per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti also peaked.
According to the police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
That's the big difference.
“In other cities, there are double the number of robberies compared to others,” said Tommi Reen, a police inspector.
The police in the market are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
“The frequency of traffic can be influenced by how much traffic is on wheels in the city and how many wheels there are at all,” says Chief Executive Officer Teemu <0xC3><0x84>ik<0xC3><0xA4>s.
Tommi Reen, the police administration, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle shelters varies greatly depending on what are the cities of study and cycling.
The market has a tight center, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a very special city, where the city centres are far from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport,” Reen says.
In Finland, there have been slightly fewer round-the-clock robberies in January-August than in the same period last year.
There is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downturn in recent years, the police report little more than 20,000 bicycle thefts per year.
It means 50-60 fillers per day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 wheels per year.
"They're big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves are more likely to take turns, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Ree urges people to make a criminal complaint about the theft of bicycles, although less than one in 10 reported cases to police will be resolved.
A typical discovered bicycle theft is one in which the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in the blood.
“There are also cases of other investigations where, for example, stolen wheels can be found in the apartment of a drug dealer,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, cyclists are arrested every week for their own crime or police investigation, says senior officer Timo Lepp<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>ki.
According to him, the wheels are stolen, for example, from the bicycle lines of the shopping malls, from the interior, from the warehouses and from the bicycle racks, i.e. practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
Most of the individual bicycle models are stolen, as in previous years, by Jopoja.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take the bike for example for short-term own use, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on sale, for example, via the Internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
“At least the police have not been informed that the stolen wheels would almost go abroad,” Reen says.
According to police, buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Part of buying a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, as he may be guilty of a hidden crime or violation.
“Warning bells should ring if well-rounded wheels are sold clearly at a low price,” Reen says.
Special librarian Severi Hirvi always wears Nopsan in his colour during his working day to protect the Kallio library in Helsinki.
The wheel he has had five pieces, but none have been stolen, says Hirvi. "It has never been taken, so far there has been a good monk."
“Maybe this doesn’t attract thieves that much, it doesn’t necessarily have hipster value here,” says Hirvi, a Helsinki thinker.
At the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, Siiri Valve quickly closed its bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the wheel stuck the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks its wheel to something fixed, such as a wheel tool.
“You have to think about it a lot, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own,” says a Helsinki student about his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time you hear from friends that the wheel has been taken."
"Especially bad wheels, those kind of r<0xC3><0xA2>m<0xC3><0xA2>-Jopoes."
The bike was stolen from the inside of the house a year ago.
The bike had not been locked, so Valve was waiting for it to start.
Under 15 years of age for crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with well-known U.S. paratroopers
In Helsinki, the so-called "comparison team" is being tried to prevent young people from getting into the crime scene.
Initially, the experiment is applied to those under the age of 15 who are now without criminal liability.
The comrade's team is missing the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the comparator team will discuss the crime with the perpetrator and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime may join the Board of Directors to remediate his crime.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Youth Executive Director, says the model is not strict.
We also have other matching models, which are used in parallel.
“Everyone is guided in a more responsible direction so that everything doesn’t go to waste from the first mistake,” Laitio says.
A model from the United States, in which it is widely used, has been adopted by the Board of Supervisors.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young person does not get in front of the adult panel, but reflects what happened around them with the same age group.
The model has been tested once.
Iikka Lovio, the service design agency in Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that this was an abuse that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes under the age of 15 years have not necessarily been dealt with at all before.
“It’s been a message to continue on the path you chose,” Lovio says.
Vertaisvalamish<0xC3><0xB6> is part of the Helsinki project for immigrant youth, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new ways of working are being offered to everyone in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans Want the Party to Stop Funding Trump’s Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the magazine, the open letter was addressed to the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to be directed to the congress halls instead of the Trump campaign.
“We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, his indifference, his incompetence, and his record-breaking dissatisfaction threaten to bring a turnaround in these elections to Democrats,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional halls can prevent Republicans from drowning in a Trump-themed anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, because Trump’s chances of winning the presidential elections are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is intended to be sent within the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a Republican who is clearly opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not a matter of anyone's support.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump’s actions, believed to have injured millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working for national security said in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises to make it easier for U.S. families
In the United States, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, said she had details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I am trying to be president so that the US economy will do well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy goes well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure – roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases on the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handicraft for American dunas who suffer from factory relocation to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in high-paying jobs after World War II.
We're the builders, we need to get back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to make it easier for working families.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the U.S. to become a taxpayer, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“As president, I’m against all trade agreements that work against workers or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculations published prior to Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday that it “recommends only millionaires like this.”
Trump’s proposed tax cuts to corporate tax havens have previously been dubbed “Trump’s piggy bank.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
These are Rio’s viewer figures: The kites have not glued the Finns to the boxes, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions are shown on television as sharp peaks in the viewer's stats.
For the time being, the Rio Olympics have not reached a huge number of spectators.
At one time, the races have tied at their best 12 percent of the population: Tuesday night’s swim was followed by 615 000 spectators from the Ylen Olympic Channel on TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the one-month-old European Championships in general sport were attended by almost 800,000 spectators at one time, and the second million European Championships in football.
So far, the most interested in the Olympics have been the Sunday-night cycling and the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, head of the sport, is pleased with the spectators’ performances, and recalls that the spectators will be divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, the Finns will follow the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV viewers choose the Olympics in general.
On the TV side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports games to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are all the time from 20,000 to 500,000, then that’s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly due to the time difference - a large part of Rio’s racing missions will be in Finland at night.
Another reason for the vague interest - if it is now considered a vague one - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken someone's surprise meter from the initials, the interest would have pumped up with it.
In addition, the general sport is only just beginning, as are other Finnish species of interest: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkien, the number of spectators at the start was close to what was expected.
When the public sport begins, the audience figures explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for kits, which rose in the first days of the kits in the Apple App Store to become the most downloaded free app in Finland.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're already on 200,000 loading roads.
“We’ll only get the network viewer numbers later,” Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked well for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by a delay and other minor technical problems at the initial stage.
Updated versions of the applications have been received, which should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics will be shown on the Yle channel and arena more broadly than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can be followed by some species, and on the radio Yle Speech broadcasts the kites on a daily basis.
The Olympians are not only perhaps the most laborious to Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sport can be seen on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is P<0xC3><0xA4>ij<0xC3><0xA4>ne, which is 95.3 meters deep at Ristinsel<0xC3><0xA4>.
It could be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a 20-square-meter-threshold weight from Ristisel<0xC3><0xA4>, the depth of which was 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre tried to strengthen the observation by making noise.
The method may not find a small depth of one hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inarij<0xC3><0xA4>rvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and P<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>rvi reach more than 80 meters.
They have not been studied as closely as the Journal.
In particular, the bottom of Inarij<0xC3><0xA4>rvi has not been mapped accurately.
“It could well be found in unknown depths,” Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by the mean depth, it is the Great Lake Jukaj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi, 23 meters.
In this way, your Sun will not reach the 10th depth and your Summer Water will be even further from the top.
Correction 12 August at 2.29 p.m.: Fixed the last track where the deepest lakes were wrong at their mid-depth.
Previous articleImaginary Taxation: Pensioners’ Taxation Still More Expensive
The taxation of pensioners continues to be more burdensome than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the disagreement came under the House of Representatives and the pensioners were promised equal pay to the wage earners.
This is not included in the Board's proposal.
We believe that it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be able to be respected after the elections, he told the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received reductions in income, which eased taxation.
The matter was heated up by the opposition representatives in the House, who then coal-fired the Minister of State for Finance Alexander Stubbi (coc.) from the election leave.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
Minister of State Finance Petteri Orpon (Council) said that tax cuts are mainly about securing purchasing power and not about increasing it, as wages will not be raised next year.
He says that tax cuts have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things don’t increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>n (centre) and Orpo’s desire to respect the competitive agreement reached in difficult times.
He says that sticking to the agreement is important in terms of credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government period.
It has been done by the power of labour market organisations, so it is not to be ignored by questioning.
It becomes a necessity, because the economy is so much behind domestic demand and people’s own future.
Long-term unemployment in the grip of unemployment
Ialainen calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to halt its growth.
The long-term unemployment in June was about 17,000 more than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72 percent is to run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, the permit will have a very large social fall.
Ambassador: There are, of course, no Finnish casualties in Thailand's attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the most urgent tourist areas, as well as to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists who are planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
There are very few Finns in Thailand.
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although their exact numbers are difficult to estimate.
The period of travel of the Finnish Thailand is extended by the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target Finns in particular in Hua Hin in order to get information about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are away from the city at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the cause of the attacks is not yet known.
The Ambassador believes that the events may relate to the political unrest of a divided society in Thailand and to the referendum last week on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who declared that they were against the law.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population is raging, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been targeted at tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The impact of the attacks on the course of the day is such that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks are not a matter of international terrorism
According to police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been shut down, according to the Thai police news agency.
At least four people have died in Thailand during the day, when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the popular tourist spot in Phuket and Hua Hin.
At a popular tourist destination in Finland, a holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require death penalty.
Two bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was injured, according to the newspaper.
In the popular tourist destination of Hua Hin, according to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
At least one person died in each of the twin bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in Surat Thani village and Trang city.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also well known for many tourists, as it transports to Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The cause of the accident is not known
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of Thailand’s ruling military alliance, said the cause of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
“We shouldn’t make people panic anymore,” he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang were related.
He told Thai BSB that the factors were intended to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland calls on the Finnish people in the country to pay attention and avoid the most urgent tourist areas, as well as to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns who are planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and their victims so far.
Last night's attack on Hua Hin has been postponed for a bit more information.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the injured are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the last attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of the well-known clock tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated the area in Hua Hin, which it believes has found another bomb.
Surat Thani's bomb was hidden in a flower bank, according to the provincial governor.
An employee of the municipality died.
There is at least one injured.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said that two bombs were also used in Surat Thani's attack, which exploded about half an hour later.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's four-match
United States Alexandra Raisman was second with 60,098 points and Russia’s Alija Mustafina third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the Rio Games with standings, jumps and poles.
Biles has mastered women’s empowerment to the fullest in recent years.
In the last three years, he has won eight personal world championships.
He has won the championships of quarterfinals and permanence three times in a row, both last year and the second year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two world championships.
Darker MM-Metals Biles has hips and sides.
Thailand’s Finnish entrepreneur: ‘Father has no impact on tourism’
Esa Huovila, who runs the real estate agency in Phuket Thailand and the children’s playground in the same building, is not worried about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I do not believe that this results in anything more miraculous, says Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who worked in Asia for about twenty years.
Experienced entrepreneurs have seen many of the tragedies that Thailand has experienced.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If you haven’t seen the tourists before, that’s hardly the case.
The Huovila company office is located a few hundred meters from the blast site.
The shelter heard of the attack from its own employee.
The employee called about nine local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
The shelter says that both the beach street and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the processions were set for the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday’s feast in Thailand.
The atmosphere was calm and the main street was allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attack.
Half the time of three days in Thailand the traffic in Patong had normalized and most of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
Later, this car was seen in the Kruunupy in Jouxholminti.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The party found two men fit for the tokens hidden in the nearby six.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other fled, but the man was later found in the woods by a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft, and serious damage to the use of motor vehicles.
The police are grateful for the hints.
Research Director on Russia’s leadership changes: A clear shift to the exclusion
In Russia on Friday, the most high-value leadership change took place over the years, when President Vladimir Putin resigned his administration chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino from Estonia.
He is a former diplomat and served as Ivanov's second husband.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent the strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that the recycling of executive functions is one way of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from declaring power independent of the president to themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been harassed or harassed by other executives.
Stations in Ivanoville
Ivanov, who is part of Putin’s inner circle, will move on to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
In a speech to state media, Putin said the change would be a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move on to other tasks and proposed Vaina in his place, Russia said today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear fall in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in the order of importance in Russia.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but became president Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro notes that the old cards, for example, the governors, have recently been exchanged in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynn<0xC3><0xB6>niemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than Ivanov’s legacy is that Putin is changing his immediate circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields as they retreated in Syria
They used civilians as human shields as they fled to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them,” said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters seized about 90 percent of the city of Manbij that was important to ISIS.
However, according to estimates, dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Fixed earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier, we mistakenly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s document line is illegal
The interior ministry’s lineup of documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, a professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own guidelines but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior has previously refused to hand over the list of participants of the Minister of the Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanomi.
The Minister reasoned on the decision with the guidance of the Office of the Council of State and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Head of Communications at the Ministry tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform its practices.
Usain Bolt's Last Olympic Performance Begins in Rio
Like the last few years, Bolt has run out of time.
He injured his back from the start and had to leave the Jamaican Olympic team behind.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better condition.
I've practiced well and that's the key," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press event included a handful of samba dancers and journalists who had become fans.
Porina Bolt is alluding to the rise of a Jamaican star in an era in which public sport has struggled with doping scandals and a slump of interest.
Bolt's previous loss at the Olympics came in Athens in 2004, when he crashed at the start of the 200 metres at a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down injuries and loose your exercise routine.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred meters, which broke the world record and the end of the self-confidence of competitors, at a time of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career goal by measuring his time.
The world records in Berlin, at 9.58 metres and 19.19 metres, are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-meter world record and a 19-second understatement, but no one but Bolt himself believes in its birth.
Bolt's main challenger is Athens 2004 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt knocked out the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost in the finals, even if he has only made his way.
In Daegu, the 100th World Cup final did not run away from Bolt due to a fallout.
Bolt turns 30 in a week.
He's an old man in the young men's race, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year’s World Cup in London as the final goal of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I’m in the Netherlands, I remind myself: this year I have to do it,” Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two Athletes Suspected of Doping Fraud
According to China's state news agency Xinhuan, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese student Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of being doping rich.
In addition, the Kenyan general sports coach was passed home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
She was ranked fourth in the women's 100 metre butterfly competition in Rio.
According to Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese judge has taken his doping case to the International Court of Sport’s CAS.
Xinhua reports that the sample given by Xinyi on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspects have also been identified in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female racer Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of an epo-hormone.
Kenya, in turn, has passed away from Rio to the home of a general sports coach because of a doping breach.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had become an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to media reports, this is a Kenyan fast-running coach, John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich's race pass in the situation.
Phelps doesn't stop at anything - historic gold came to the stage
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, American Michael Phelps, swims 200 metres in his 22nd Olympic Games in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the Olympic gold of the same species in the quarter-finals.
Phelps's winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino placed second in the mix before China's Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview.
The story of Helen Skelton (opinion) on Monday is the most read of this week on the evening’s website.
Next up is Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not have much stress if there is a small amount of noise in the Finnish or British press about his revealing and special outfits.
The TV has visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough exposure - at least in the eyes of many conservative British men.
However, backpacks are not allowed.
It’s important to look good, and small courts are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to soften up and maybe even get upset, but he insists he doesn’t want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We're watching sports here, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I'm dressed.
Can you imagine that the plague has gone all the way to Finland?
I can’t, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do mornings and how big of a sacrifice they make is ok for me, Skelton laments.
You know what?
It will be empty if it comes from (the drinker’s) clothing.
I'm a little interested if this one's hit someone.
Rio police made two arrests for terror attack
Rio police said on Thursday that it had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.

The detainees are believed to have links to the Islamic State.
The detainees had, of course, litigated violence on social media.
Violent messages were circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of Rio's whales.

Argentinian Lady Dressed Up as Pet<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>-Siren - Finnish Thought for Protest
The wind at Pet<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind from the Pet<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>-Sire hit hard on Thursday.
On Thursday in Rio, the Argentine lady dressed in the Wind of Pet<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>-Siren at the opening of the Women’s Surfing Day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent conceded a foul.
He was left behind because of the collar, and others fled, Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete has been thinking about protest for a long time.
It was not worth it then, because, according to the Olympic rules, it would have been unnecessary.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund, said Pet<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>-Sire.
The Finnish snorkeled on the table until the last time, because he did not want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
The Finnish left with a collar on his departure instead of 27.
In total, London’s 2012 Olympic silver medallist is the eighth.
There was little impact on the collar.
Friday is an important day when there are races from 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Apart from the first information, there was no protest by Pet<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>-Sire.
7 Special Things That, According to Science, Extend the Age
Science has explored everything that is possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years into a person’s life.
Some of these are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life lasts longer.
Sometimes things that a person can’t influence themselves can bring him extra years.
These include, among other things, a tendency to medium-term mobility or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your lifespan.
You don’t always have to shave – just applying for a milk towel is enough.
The secret of a long life has been explored by many different studies.
The Medical Daily reported seven of the strangest research findings.
According to science, all of these things can lead to more years of life.
Drinking coffee and beer
Coffee consumption has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “decreased risk of death,” especially in relation to neurological or cardiovascular diseases.
There are also studies that suggest that the use of alcohol - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived longer than people who didn’t drink at all.
Regular use of toothpaste can extend a person’s life by up to six years, according to one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation of the intestines.
They can, in turn, contribute to the spread of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughter affected people’s lives.
The seven-year project was attended by more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were more mature people 35 percent more likely to be alive after the test.
Sex, when sexual protection has been taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
There will be additional years in the industry, there will be no denying it.
However, reaching a long age does not require unconditional commitment.
One study from the University of Oxford found that women who had a large back had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study combined these factors with a lower mortality rate.
Whether it’s an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bully.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring additional years to his life.
Some researchers, however, suspect that a long life span is due to a person’s social status – which, in turn, allows, for example, the achievement of awards such as the Nobel Prize.
A study that looked at buying behaviors of people over 65 years of age found that a person who shopped on a daily basis is more likely to be a parent who shopped less often.
This is due to the fact that spinning in specific stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to death.
So take your credit card out of your hands - so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Umpihumanain wheel soup slid towards truck
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car accident took place in Koske, Finland.
The accident occurred in Koske, Koskentien and Sorvastonti in the middle of Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car had been driven to the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck remained upright, but set fire to the fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car slid into the lane and from there on the lane across the roof.
The woman, who was born in 1972, was stuck in her car.
The rescue agency removed the injured driver from his car and transported him to the Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breathing test was 2.02 promille.
He's suspected of having a rough ride.
Posts sent postcards to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in the retail selection of Salon K-Citymarket because the mail had delivered part of the load accidentally to the Sein<0xC3><0xA4>jo.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perni<0xC3><0xB6>, was on Thursday buying spare parts from Salon K-Citymarket, when it hit the eye with a fun plate.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages in remote areas, because Posti delivered our cargo to Sein<0xC3><0xA4>jo!
We will get more when Posti gets the delivered cargo!
So if you don't crawl in a lawn mower, you read in the village.
The seller’s fourth shelf is related to the fact that in the last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
The grass cutting is on offer from Posti until the end of August.
According to Haltia, the site was mostly interesting and she decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update made me nervous.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention paid to this matter is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her favourites stuck in a loose-knit bag, even though a few of the barns were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti Enterprises Transport Services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomi.
The background is that three of the five stages went wrong yesterday (Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki) and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (Saloon) with three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomi.
This was first reported by the Evening Messages.
Teija Haltia didn’t bother with the shelf because she found all her own freeware favourites from the selection.

Family Wish of a Woman Murdered in Loviisa: Victim's Memories for Police Dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by donating to the police.
Sipoo’s veterinary department has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked at the Sipoo Veterinary Station as a substitute and had also completed his nursing training there.
The veterinarian's grandmother remembers the words that touched the woman.
Happy, smart, humorous and work fearless.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to the police dogs as a whole, primarily for the purchase of safe dogs.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her hometown of Loviisa Koskenkyl.
The woman's neighbors have told the Nightlife that the victim was a good animal lover.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder knew no woman and had no contact with each other.
A police dog named B<0xC3><0xB6>rje, who was injured in a life-threatening arrest, was involved in the tracking of the killer.
However, the storm is still alive and is recovering.
The District Court handed down a judgment in Postille on breach of the Equality Act
Posti did not have the right to withhold the salary of the employee who refused to adopt the hired worker, Kanta-H<0xC3><0xA4>mei’s right of appeal in his judgment.
The district court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the suspended salary and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Posti could have withhold only part of the salary of the facilitator, who was responsible for the part of the facilitation of the whole day's work.
According to the district court, the employee had been placed in a more disadvantaged position on the basis of his professional association activities in contravention of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU's decision to organise the postal and logistic sector.
During last November’s postseason, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees were not aware of the shortage of broken hires.
This was first reported by People's News.

Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> and Soini repeatedly highlight the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
Putin resigns as head of government, replaces Estonian-born Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has separated the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
The place will be replaced by the son of Anton Vaino, the communist leader of the Soviet-Virus Karl Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Vice President since 2012.
It will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration on the head of state.
According to the Kremlin, Ivanov, who is part of Putin’s close inner circle, will move to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move on to other tasks and proposed Vaina in his place, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the spying of the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin’s re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's massive buy-in to the game ban - not seen in the opening of the Election League
The world record holder of football transfers will not be seen on the field when England’s Electoral College kicks off on weekends.
Paul Pogban followed the game with England.
Manchester United's giant Paul Pogba is on the sidelines of his game against Bournemouth on Sunday at the opening of the ManU, the BBC said on Friday.
According to the British Times, ManU paid 105 million euros from Pogba to Juventus.
However, the English Football Association FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba left Juventus as a game ban.
He received two warnings at last season’s Italian Cup, and it will be a one-game ban.
That game ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on 19 August, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow's size madness is good
Accurate criteria for entertainment and ambitious visions have established Flow Festival’s status as an internationally acclaimed event aimed at the world’s top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festive wearers have typically expressed themselves in their own unique clothing.
One of the main artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival’s event area is settled by, among other things, art fairs and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a rock tent, says the event’s artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, held this weekend in Suvilah, Helsinki, has grown from a small district festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
In the background of success, there is a simple question: What kind of event would the actors themselves want to go to?
It is quite unusual in the production of events to think so.
Often the goal is to reach the level of necessity and act in accordance with the authority’s orders, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors last year to 70,000 by 5,000 people.
This year’s festival will also feature a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because you have to make some kind of financing.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a cattle herd, controlled by a huge herd.
That's not what we want.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been pushed in such a way that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant counters and bars in the partially carved area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller performance stages, 15,000 people’s tents will be used as an art venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little crazy about size, but at the same time, we've been able to retain Flow's spirit.
If it's gone, it's not our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for Kallio’s work is that today even great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, the activity in the mid-twentieth century was very dependent on the support of the city of Helsinki of about 20,000 euros.
Last year, the company’s turnover from Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
With it, you can achieve "crucial things", such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves in their own unique clothing.
Along with the music event, you can also talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as a special fashion.
First of all, we want to stand out from the content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s value world: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment,” says Kallio.
This year, one of the main artists is the punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan base in his own genre, but at the festival combining indie rock, pop music, rap and soul it is not the most typical performances.
According to Kallio, Iggy was sacked because now is probably the last time this is seen at the theatre in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what's played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's made some damn good gigs in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded at the local time on Thursday evening.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower jar and exploded with the help of mobile phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, the majority of whose customers are foreign.
They exploded at the same time as tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a stunning picture of the impact.
If the tweet doesn't look good, you can check it out here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded near the bars.
It happened in one of the largest barricades, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of injured is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the popular island of Phuket.
Of course, no one is dead.
At the same time, a second double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were injured.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb from Hua Hin that had not yet been detonated.
According to Thai authorities, behind the bombings are likely to be insurgent forces who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, there may also be criminal organisations involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have been busy with the activities of criminal organizations that conduct human trafficking in recent times.
KSML: This Part of New Preparedness Units Begins to Fight in War Situation
In an acute war situation, the armed forces are ordered to fight only after several months of swearing in a soldier, says Central Finland.
According to Jukka Sonnisen, the head of training for the Defence Forces interviewed by the magazine, for example, only those who are at the end of their training are eligible to fight in the event of a 5.5-month war.
According to the Head of Training, the service is first assigned to reserve personnel belonging to the preparatory teams.
No crew or reservists are assigned to a task that has not been provided with the required training, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it was revealed that the Armed Forces will begin training personnel in the immediate readiness units starting next year.
Units can be used in military operations already during the training of the armed forces, if necessary.
Pamela Tola Receives Giant Compensation From Home
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The retail price of the two-storey separate list was EUR 330,000.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, which caused a dangerous microbiota for health.
The couple were forced to sell their home in 2014.
The selling price had fallen to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>132,000, resulting in a financial loss to Tola and Rome of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>198,000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller disputed the claim, but Tola and Romana won the case in both court and court.
The court handed down the verdict in the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance in which the seller was ordered to pay to Tola and to Rome EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the couple’s trial and investigation costs.
The court reasonably reduced the price, because some of the repair needs of the apartment had already been known to the buyers when making the apartment trade.
However, according to the court, the reported building defects were significantly more serious than had been presented.
Tola looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a decent home because they did not want to make repairs.
He had the impression that the building was in good condition and that there was no harm in the aspects mentioned in the audit report.
The health inspection report referred to the risk and inaccuracy of air exchange and the fact that the management of rainwater and melting waters along the rock surface is insufficient.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it did not appear that this was an urgent matter in any way.
Tola and Rome realized that rainwater coming from the rock should be managed a little bit in a few years.
Trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the wet problems of the apartment were much more serious.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 identified microbial growth in the building, which, according to the witnesses, were due to both the precipitation of the rock and the capillary rise in soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector's assessment, also reach the indoor areas through the chimney.
A sample of a home care room, a basement staircase, a living room window corner and a laundry room were found in the samples of the health risk, cross-border molds or scratches.
Steels were built without permission.
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended against the building permit.
The Court considered that Tola and Rome were not aware of the decision of the city of Espoo prior to the trade, according to which the apartment had been subject to changes contrary to the permit.
Among other things, the terraces were built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
Home issues, however, were a key issue in court.
According to the court, buyers could, on the basis of the information received from the seller prior to the sale, assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for any major repairs in the near future.
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, there was no particular reason for Tola and Rome to carry out a more general inspection.
Buyers have not neglected their reporting obligations, the court of appeal states in its judgment.
Hungry archival work: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for the Nazis - Finnish register also
In a recent article by Dagens Nyheter, Christopher Andersson writes how the National Archives in Maryland has recorded documents for microfilms about a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazism.
The documents and registration cards are from the Nazi-German racial agency.
The branch was headed by Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were carried out on women to find out.
The racial agency looked at the background of women, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's race.
Women were also to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship, to give up their manuscripts and to give good recommendations to their loved ones.
The racial agency wanted to ensure that the women were "baby lovers", "saverists", and "good national socialists", who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The case does not explain how 14 Finnish women were found from the archives.
The SS leaders created a state-supported program, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
Among other things, the programme stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside of it.
The Lebensborn houses take care of children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme has not been very actively promoted, as reported on the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the population policy of the Nazis focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
A German mother's honorarium was awarded to women who had had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum said.

Jari Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>n Satulinna was recorded at night for a couple of hours: "I was so bored"
Jari Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>, from the cruise ship’s barrio to the 1995 Tango, Finland’s best-selling solo artist and star of the dance ships and festivals, is still able to score and is currently in a hefty climb.
Written by Mari Koppisen, the book about the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> - Paljaana was published on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> tells about his life and career both good and bad.
The career of the bridgehead rose to a total height when he won the crown of the Tango at the Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki Tango Market in 1995.
The cat Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuopapam<0xC3><0xA4>ki had composed a tango song for Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> on the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen agreed to in a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the song's sound didn't go exactly according to plan: Bridgehead sang it on the tape in a terrible crack and only after a couple of hours of nights.
We had a party tonight.
I was so hooked!
The head of the bridge is remembered in the book.
It was not immediately thought that the song had been sung in a krapula.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, the track was still good.
I learned that you don’t always have to demand perfection and excellence.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular songs, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013 Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> parted from his then partner and the case ended up in the lyrics of the song You deserve gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the lyrics ordered from Saara T<0xC3><0xB6>rm<0xC3><0xA4>se were not what Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> would have wanted.
Bridgehead had imagined himself making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song that tells the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of a 7-day newspaper news report.
In the newspaper’s news, Jar and the ex-boyfriend were told about Jar’s excessive celebration and alcohol use, but Jar said it was full of dolls and didn’t fit.
According to the book, Jari played in anger at the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good so.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52 per cent of the voters voted in favour of the difference and 48 per cent would have remained in the Union, even though the polls for the week predicted the opposite outcome.
The British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No respected research institution or university has flagged for the difference, although a couple of individual researchers should disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of Bill Clinton’s campaign, “It’s the economy, stupid,” flew to the brink of ruin in the UK’s Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.

The Centre for Macroeconomics, in its last monthly survey, will provide answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not heard, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people who work, which is almost standard.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's really out of the UK.
Many also have the idea that lowering the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
According to the Economist, the voters did not believe in economic arguments, because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently presented.
They were skewed, in particular, by the BBC's equality, which gave as much space to economists who represent only a few percent of the economic community as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU hostile press was not interested in telling the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE about the consequences of the divergence.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both heard and understood, they were not taken care of, because economists represent an elite with which voters do not think they have any common interests.
The academics of big cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message did not work in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy.
The Brexit vote’s overriding profit argument was about immigration.
An immigrant will take your job, an immigrant will occupy your hospital, an immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments have prevailed.
Each café has a number of foreign employees.
How many more jobs would there be for the British if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre, immigrants are seen.
How much easier would it be for the British to have a doctor’s appointment if they didn’t?
Every school has children of immigrants as well.
How much easier would it be for the right British children to get a place to go to school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more space would beginners have if they were to leave?
In my opinion, these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists did not succeed in responding to them, and if they did, their answers did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK's public economy and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen’s real estate fund set for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, which is managed by Pertti Vanhanen, a Finnish real estate investor.
In Aberdeen, he said, plans for Brexit were made in time by drawing up plans for A and B.
Plan B, i.e. a win for EU-disaggregated camp, started to be expected a few weeks before the vote in the event that the result would be left.
The concern was that investors would begin to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large amounts of liquid assets, but now they could be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, says Olden, the only open daily listed real estate fund that the news concerned.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
That was the highest number in the nine open real estate funds, according to Vanhanen of all the open real estate funds of the UK.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at or even below 10%.
So the real estate funds were prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed down the trade.
When the EU-supported camp won, Europe became confused.
However, the less than two weeks that followed the vote in the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney, CEO of the Bank of England, in which he assessed that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate agents.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
These, together, took over the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous about it.
The snowball started to spin, and the fund after each other had to close its door.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the money raised, but it also eventually had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing down.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of the announcement was canceled.
Since then it has been fairly flat, and now the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen Manner-Europe Funds have not had any similar lobbying.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Irrational attention to real estate funds
In the olden’s view, the closures of the real estate funds trade received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open funds to which the closures concerned control about four per cent of Britain’s real estate.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may hold its funds for the middle of 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been slashed downwards, but the situation does not appear to be "worse" from Aberdeen's point of view.
The major issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities to some of the real estate investors, Oldane notes.
The pound and dollar rate is at its weakest in 30 years, in addition to which the market has a 15% discount on the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar owner can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of buyers, the old man said.
Brexit Brings Downsides to London Real Estate Market
At two o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't seem very strange.
But of the four, when Pertti Olden, who is responsible for real estate investments in the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's where the power comes in.
I realized that this is now going to go to plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed straight to work.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning.
The normally voiceless TV screens in the office were buzzing with news, and usually the loud crowd was quiet to listen fully when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the display ends only flashed in red.
It was a morning that I would never have believed to be alive, the old man said.
Despite the landslide, Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, ended two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote, in a bid to close two real estate deals.
The feeling was mixed.
However, the company was well-prepared for the option, and therefore the situation was somewhat calm, says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote starts a remedial movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
When the British leadership collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The markets were beginning to anticipate limits on the UK and, in particular, London real estate markets.
The London office space is expected to have up to 20 percent less in the coming years.
Soon, a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading after each other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the poison has gone down, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not appear on the faces of Oldasen who spent his last summer days in Helsinki this week.
It is far too early for him to say much about what Brexit will bring.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of London's real estate market has already been first reported.
CBRE’s data on price development in the real estate services sector covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the minimum was 6.1 per cent, Oldane points out.
The numbers are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
Monthly indexes began to be published in 1987, and only in five months have there been worse numbers, says Vanhanen.
All the same major declines occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
That is why it is interesting that Brexit was quite quickly compared to the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
In the old view, the comparison is not quite appropriate, because it is now a home-grown crisis in Britain.
The tunnel is another one.
The real estate market has not seen a panic sale like that at the time, but a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
The funding is also available normally.
The repair could have been done anyway.
In fact, the price-fixing movement is not a miracle for him – it could have been without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of properties in London and other major cities around the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
The fall started from a very high point.
London's prices have skyrocketed for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, as have the population of London.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalizing, says Oldane.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment destinations from abroad.
London is known as the city's easy destination.
In addition, prices have fed a low rate of interest, which is why, for example, pension companies have had to look for products from new items.
Loans on this have been readily available - although the debt tree has now been used significantly less, according to Oldasen, than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Disperse, disperse
In London, prices rose evenly last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was also a net seller last year.
There was some kind of twist, and now it came.
What's going on?
It depends on how the UK’s economy is developing, says Vanhanen.
Many do not dare to evaluate the future, but say that no ascending peaks are hardly allowed.
The feeling suggests that there is a downward or even expenditure in front of it.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the coup will be solved by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global disintegration.
If you have invested in one market, there is too much of a victim.
If it is distributed, the risks are also distributed, says Oldane.
The S-group will start to register the purchase details in more detail
The S-Group knows what you’re eating, as the Group said today it was starting to collect even more detailed information about its customers’ purchases.
So far, when information on the final amount of the receipt has been collected, the group will begin to collect it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-group comes after Kesko, because the information on the goods purchased with a pluscard has been collected in the Kesko customer register for a couple of years already.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the program has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
For a time, few customers have denied the use of product data, Riitala tells Taloussanom.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the S-group registration change.
Kesko already categorizes its customers according to only food purchases into ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Clients are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for the purpose of marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchasing information is only collected from the K-group’s own chains.
Our partners, such as Neste Oil, will not disclose your information.
Lidl Finland does not have a stand-alone customer programme and is not currently planning to do so.
Finland’s L<0xC3><0xA4>hikauppa has its own Ykk<0xC3><0xB6>sbonus-bank client program, which can be found in the Electoral Houses, Siwo and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information about product or product group levels, we remain at the level of the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made and the day I and the final amount of the customer receipt.
We have not gone to that level as a K-group or an S-group,” says commercial manager Anu Ora.
According to him, the position-customer program is intended to be renewed in the future, but L<0xC3><0xA4>hikauppa will report on this later.
However, Ora does not promise to register product information.
At first, the experiment
Until now, SOK’s customer and customer register has been relatively large.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic data included profession, education, form of residence as well as years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role is also registered.
The S-Etukort purchase includes the date and time of the purchase, the place, the amount of the purchase and the payment method.
In addition, the information of the S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchasing data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, data in S-markets, Prismo, Kodi Terro and ABC chains are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have had hopes that marketing could be targeted more accurately, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of customer and partner operations at SOK.
The S-Group says it will notify its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in cash registers anyway, wanted it or not.
You can check your stored data from the S-Group website.
For example, cats do not get access to data, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog confirmation - puppy becomes first explosive dog
The black labrador retriever’s puppy carefully sews five similar boxes placed on the ground line at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport.
It won’t take long when it’s firmly sitting next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog by playing it with his favorite dog.
From the box next to which Heila was sitting, there was a jar of incense smelling on the griddle.
This is the first smell that Heila has now practiced, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and e-commerce reasons for access
Heila is the first dog to specialise in the search for weapons and explosives and is set to work at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport next year.
The tasks may be carried out by Heila and Sunti, if necessary, to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels have led to measures in Customs and control has been strengthened after the attacks, says the Customs Superintendent Mikko Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Another reason for the training of a gun and explosive dog in Customs’s duties is the postal shipments that pass through Helsinki-Vantaa.
With the growth of internet commerce, up to 40 million postal shipments pass through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
Over the past few years, Tulli has made a discovery at Helsinki-Vantaa airport of some 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their starting materials, from purchases of online shopping, passenger goods and aircraft.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki-Vantaata.
It will investigate checked baggage and mail shipments.
Ports will have great benefits in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Based on the performance of the helmet, Tulli assesses whether there will be more training for gun and explosive dogs in the future.
Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg is looking forward to the idea.
the Church School
The Heila-Pennu training is coordinated by the Tulli Dog School in Kirkkonummella.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with the police and the experts of the Defence Forces.
The police have extensive experience in dog training and expertise in explosives from the Armed Forces.
Customs, together with other authorities, will decide what fragrances Heila is taught to identify.
The heel is always trained as needed, says Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki-Vantaa include six drug dogs from Customs and the money and drug dogs from Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from 10 puppy breeds.
The criteria for choosing a dog at the airport include grazing and hunting, as well as tranquility, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Sunti’s home, is a close working friend of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila getting home, Suntio laughs.
Gentle command goes to Heila at once.
The late-night cameraman loses the camera coat for the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-looking coat immediately from the "out" command.
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level examinations ahead, next October, to assess whether there is sufficient training for demanding work tasks.
Heila can be seen at work at Helsinki-Vantaa in the next half of the year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers can’t come to lick the workbags of the dog on top, Suntio recalls.
The cost of one working dog is about EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven or eight years, up to ten years, after which they will retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work parts last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of a working dog is a fierce competition in Customs.
Heila was the owner of about 20-30 Customs employees.
Luck hit Sunti, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs as well as monitoring duties in Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
Under one million people in Fiji’s Olympic gold in rugby are so highly regarded in the country that the government has designated August 22 as the national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off is considered the team's return home the next day.
The hero team is also allowed to celebrate in their home country.
The Fijian rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the final was followed in the capital city of Suva, where a screen was set up for the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering, Fiji Times reporter Mikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish composer turned after a fierce performance
The weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a 175 kg hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after the lifting of the arms, he has rotated several times.
No one has ever been able to say why.
Tokola gained 175 kilos from work in Rio and 145 kilos from tempo.
His combined weight was 320 kg.
Tokola tried to get his job at the last 175 kilograms, as well as each other.
In the third company, the weights increased as a result of a huge outcry.
The body remained under pressure until the jury accepted the lift.
The joy of a Finnish waiter is that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemen Palloseura, who plays in the men's football league, has signed a permanent contract with the Estonian striker Albert Prosa at the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player in our team who has the power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through more than 50 players from all over the world with more than ten player agents.
The small team started to stand out as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from rural Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to join RoPS on Saturday in the Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki, where the Rovaniemi meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS became in need of a new attacker when last season's goaltender Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Threatened Modern Family Star Resurrected: Teen Star Shorts Reveal Almost Everything
In the Modern Family comedy series, Alex Dunphyna, who became known as Ariel Winter, is once again rapping by portraying his daring body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don’t leave much imagination behind.
The shorts not only revealed the actor’s legs but also this backside.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to be considerably bolder.
The star has posed on social media in her images in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very thin clothes.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can view it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
Amy Palmer, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, said Winter is in the process of “a typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his entire life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more it looks like a bare surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood gets, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series at the age of 11.
The actor has teased some of his long-time fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to imagine where she will be in ten years’ time, when the downside is already so hard, says a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the female fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge him to be immediately critical.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, sparking a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the wind: in autumn it is possible to see the autumn mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese to start the revontulimats from the beginning, Visit Finland says in the report.
Inari and Levi are the main subjects of the Japanese Revonture.
The Revontures are the maps of our winter tourism, and they are strongly combined with the warm winter and the snowy landscape.
There is a lot of demand in Lapland’s winter resorts, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Rarely do we know that the revontuli season begins from early autumn and continues far into spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the revontures of the scene twice as much as the precipitation, says Anne Lind, Head of Marketing at Visit Finland.
Visit Finland’s main target groups are wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landing among the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique sights from Finland, and this revontula has huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown significantly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finland’s tourism as a target group, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros per day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain agrees to a silver FID master’s course in leading gold
Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed on Fidzi's last challenge in Thursday's final, as the team experienced a 43-7 defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi organized a master's course in handling, drilling, casting, support game, runners-up, and silk while winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The loss was accompanied by a reasonable consolation from the silver medalists – the third of the day in Britain – and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby start tournament, in which they won the New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A hard 7-5 win from South Africa in the semi-finals on the same day may have made it difficult for them to reach the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won in this condition even a 15-person top-scoring team.
Britain may – but probably not – be relieved that at least one British has a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fide’s head coach is Ben Ryan, England’s former Wimbledon boss.
The Great Britain trip has been quite a journey.
Eight years ago, they coached Ryan and lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This back sauna hurts, but the development is horrendous.
Fidi started to fight against Great Britain for the sake of fun.
Captain Tom Mitchell with his teams this was as if they were running towards moving buses, and the World Champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau sank in the corner of the finish line.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown in his right hand led to a paint job.
12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant backlash stopped male-mountain Leone Nakaraw from scoring a third goal, but it was just a delay for Fid.
In seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, and Great Britain was 17-0.
Nakarawa again scored a new start, and there was still more than a minute left... in the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou jumped through the Great Britain’s trenches and rushed to the line to make the painting.
After the break, the score was 29-0.
It seemed as if Fidi had been born to play rugby, while the UK was only learning the game.
And that's how it really is.
The United Kingdom made a lot of changes at the time, blocking Fida's pado... for a total of four minutes, which was fine compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova made the painting after Fida's impressive feeding game.
Dan Norton scored a goal for Great Britain in a left corner touchdown and narrowed the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea Islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in spectators.
It was hard not to be surprised by Fid's cheerful approach.
Mata Viliame had a last-minute painting of a shell in Fida's cake, which did not require the shelling.
The pill was swallowed, the Philistines were crushed, and Great Britain fell to the ground, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan in the 20-5 semi-finals, and the United Kingdom won South Africa's tight semi-finals, both of which scored one goal - a British finish would solve the game.
Kyle Brown led South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with a dazzling footwork and made it under the finish line in the second half.
A great late knockout from Marcus Watson, England's 15-side rugby team from Anthony's brother, is sure to win and eventually silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer was aimed at Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's victory
There won’t be any more terrifying feelings of gold in these races, and it really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard knocks towards the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning from their golden moment at Estacio da Lago.
Although they supported each other, there were three voices in the boat: Coach Robin Williams's jaw was present all the time, as the two were arguing for their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's doubles competition - the first women in the history books of British sport to achieve this feat.
Their management was perfect, and their 39th appearance was invincible, which is also record-breaking.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes joining the surface of the ribs at the ankle, is not entirely a picture of the nature of the win.
There is a group of auxiliaries who gradually promote the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as a trainer who did not know 30 months ago after being diagnosed with cancer, would he live to this day.
As he said, the situation was tense.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut, it spreads everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It changes your way of thinking a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was lucky that his treatment was able to begin at the beginning of 2014 outside the season, when they caused as little disturbance as possible – if that expression can ever be used in such situations.
I had to get paid, so I had to recover quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department -- 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Self-jumping is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the win, the first couple of thoughts were Williams, who had had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more casually trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced commander of Afghanistan's Royal Craft Regiment, said: "I've had a sense of humor this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just underlines how important this is to me, how hard Helen and I, and Robin, have worked.
It's been a great three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he's a big thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have imagined a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition for five years.
The pair set a tight pace that their competitors did not reach.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in store.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen shouted, “Stay in the process, stay in the process.”
It is really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything special.
We didn’t look for joy today, we just tried to win a good fight and win a fight, and that’s what we did.
A couple waits a year before deciding on their future.
Glover attends the wedding next month, when he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this would be my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland to replace Panamanian government with squabbling
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are already in demand by representatives of the Panamanian media in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers exposed the tax loopholes of a number of Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day is now set for October 29.
Analysts say it’s hard to predict how much people’s recent anger will affect the outcome of the autumn elections.
In the June presidential election, criticism of the powerful was clearly seen, and Gudni Johannesson, who was elected president from outside politics, was elected.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama to be the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has canceled his most recent impeachment speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the organization’s founding.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the talks and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can push you down like that, according to Clinton's tweet.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned Muslims from wearing their favorite burkini swimsuit on the beaches, according to the British newspaper The Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to the beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone who does not have a good manner and a swimsuit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which largely express religious connections, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove France’s national holiday to a crowd.
At the end of July, two extremist groups linked to Isis attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest who was over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region would pass through the barrier - Pyyk<0xC3><0xB6>sj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi
The water samples taken from the official bathing beaches of Oulu area meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only on the shore of Lake Pyyk<0xC3><0xB6>sj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi there is a blue lake.
The environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples on Tuesday and Wednesday from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and salt-based enterococci bacteria in all bathing waters were subject to the restrictions imposed by the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations of the waters of the Gulf of Meriniem were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial levels had fallen below the action limits.
The bluefin tuna caught by the Pyyk<0xC3><0xB6>sj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi swimming pool does not yet make the water undrinkable, but under favorable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into a bluefin tuna, where the surface of the water forms a blue-green dormant crust.
Environmental action follows the situation with the tightest scrutiny.
If the bluefin tuna becomes a bluefin tuna, this shall also be reported separately on the notice sheet of the bathing beach.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction that would be granted on the basis of the gift tax of the forest state.
The proposal of the Ministry of State Finance has four objectives: to promote the generational change of forest premises, to reduce the age of forest owners, to increase the size of the forest space and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote the forest economy for entrepreneurs.
The forest owner would make a reduction in the net capital income of the forest economy.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational change of forest spaces is good, commented Juha Hakkarainen, Director of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, it is tempting to find a critical tax reform proposal.
The forest gift reduction is presented as a result of the owner's net capital income.
It is capital income, from which all other deductions have been deducted.
In the opinion of MTK and Hakkaranen, the impact of the tax reduction would be higher if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the tree.
The VM's proposal is based on a reduction in the net capital income of the forestry sector to prevent the loss of the capital income of the forestry sector, which would be reduced by other taxation.
Such a person would be taxed even if the tree did not sell.
The calculation model is quite complex.
The average forest owner can’t figure it out, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, according to him, the model applies only a small part of the forest owners.
The limit for the tax reduction linked to the value of forest yields is EUR 40 000 on the proposal.
It's been dragged too high in Haqqarainen's opinion.
According to him, this cuts 82 percent of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owner population, he says.
In the VM, it is considered that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the capacity.
In forest policy, forest gift reduction has been carried out according to Hakkaranien for decades.
Behind it is the ageing of the forest owner community.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years old, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful raekuuro surprised motorists at Himanga - two cars slid into the street and crashed into each other
On Friday morning, there was a special backstroke on the Himanga River.
According to the rescue agency, two cars in a row crashed into the lane, after which came a collision behind the previous one.
According to the firefighter Harri Pyhti<0xC3><0xA4>, the storm is believed to have been caused by a strong thunderstorm.
There were two people in the back of the car, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the previous car was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himang to Kalajou a few kilometers away.
A Finnish study can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to be more effective.
The findings of the research team of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow in the usual way in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatment may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on August 4 in the journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhosi’s family murder continues in court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
The death toll of Muhos family continues in court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced in June to prison for the family's murder at Muhoks.
The second was given 8 years 4 months of murder and aggravated robbery, among other things as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for the murder and brutal robbery of a young person.
The convicted person was also given a sentence for threatening traffic safety as a young person and for transporting traffic noise as a young person.
Prosecutors, prosecutors and the man who received a more severe sentence complained about the court’s verdict.
The prosecutor demands a lesser punishment for the man who was convicted of the murder as a young person for 12 years in prison.
You were in full agreement at the time.
According to the district court, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as a director of the school's child protection unit last July.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, allegedly attacked the driver sitting in the back of the living room on the sofa.
The conductor had gotten out of the hold and shoved the young man into his room, when another young man hit him with a vacuum tube.
Among other things, the director was also tortured in the lead, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind investigation, both defendants were at the time of the act in full comprehension.
According to the court, young people had planned to flee their homes at least from the previous day.
Ice fishing is the world’s longest-running backbone, only increasing at the age of 156
The world’s longest living spinal cord has been confirmed to be ice-bound, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that roams around Greenland, the holker can live up to 400 years.
The male only grows at the age of 156.
The life of the iceberg adds to the fact that it grows only one centimeter per year.
Only one species is known to live for longer than one species.
The researchers found out the age with radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated to be 392 years old – however, throwing in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as economic visa - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
Even a third of all the state’s tax revenues would be lost if Donald Trump’s change to corporate tax is implemented.
Tax revenues were also reduced, in particular, by the richest tax cuts that benefitted the most.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary in his presentation of it in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax would go from 35 percent to 15 percent.
Without collecting, there would be a really great amount, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, 33 after Trump’s downturn.
The inheritance tax would be waived in full.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of business life and of running small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards that have been decided on by the waste must be renewed and the regulation of the energy sector must be broken.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be remedied.
The Board must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, the “destructive” trade policy is the biggest cause of the U.S. problem.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty of 45 per cent and a penalty of 35 per cent from Mexico.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our religion,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the sea, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
By the way, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the aides, despite the fact that the well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists – including Republicans nearby – are seeing the U.S. take Trump’s program to a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton announced her plan early on Friday for Finland’s time.
A wave of attacks on the past - People's News
The sea roars wildly, but the real wave of attack strikes in the middle of Madrid's street lane - whether an account can begin with the past.
This is at the heart of Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var’s new story.
Almodovar’s previous directorial work Travel Lovers (2013) was a small-scale and rosy satirical comedy, preceded by the Skin where I live (2011) the pinnacles of a Spanish career.
Juliet (2016) is located somewhere between the two works of art.
It is a conventional symbiotic love, human relationship and family drama, with the relationship between mother and daughter at the center.
The story is simple and we see it as a long backstory.
Life seems to be on its model for a middle-aged name character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of an accidental encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be in wonder all the way to the end of the movie.
In the form of a back letter and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, the moment he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta will be presented as a young teacher by Adraina Ugarte, from the TV series Ommelte (2013-2014).
Juliet’s aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a kitchen, but I would say that it’s time for a quick and verbal one-off.
For Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var films, there is often a fair distance in Juliet due to its so distinctive versatility.
It is a well-played, controlled, place with good music, and a rather depressing film, where it is the element of elegy.
Instead, the typical visual color blindness for the Spanish director is on it and in such a way that it starts to put a little bit of silence in the eye as a more pure form rather than acting as a dramatic effect.
People in the film experience illnesses, deaths, or just sudden losses, but the surface remains the same in Korean.
This applies in particular to the costume: in the case of the name person, the outfits change from scene to scene, and the same applies to the replacements that appear.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var is precise in these matters, but the main point, that is to say, of each case, is not particularly immediate.
Mechanically, when repeated, the impression is superficial and slightly breathless.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has written a book on the basis of three novels by Alice Munro, a 2013 Canadian Nobel Prize laureate.
Novels have been published in Karkulainen: Narratives.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly balanced literary filmmaking.
The elements would have been emotionally unmatched by even more intense drama, while the theme of leffa deals with big things - especially the film's guilt.
Directed and written by Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
Main characters: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film's premiere date is 12.8.
The government is trying to win elections - People's News
New cuts are not being made, the ministers are shaking so that the fundamental Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the operations decided in the spring are carried out by the wholesaler.
There will be no further surgery.
The four billion savings already decided is enough.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> (centre) and Minister of State for Finance Petteri Orpo (council) under the budget tour.
Keep in mind that there are no new cuts in the VM's presentation, because the social security cuts were decided already in the spring frame.
Children's allowances, national pensions, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of unemployment insurance for women is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
The training sessions continue.
Obsessed with customs
Why do the ministers insist so strongly that no new cuts are being made on them?
Because next year is election year.
The elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the election year, not the Gallup.
Rather, it has been seen that the municipal income that leads to the different directions of the governing parties is spoiling the mood of the government for a long time.
However, the Gallup reports that the ruling party of the Finnish fundamentalists expects a stagnation, even though its previous elections resulted in a modest 12.3% turnout compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns received 752 new mandates, most of which will realize the price of influence in right-wing governance next spring.
The lifeline of the government of about three major parties is in the possession of the Finnish constitution.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted have had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's presence have also surfaced.
There will be no new cuts in the rhetoric, first of all, the fact that next year they will be done vigorously and secondly, the attempt to soften the expected blow to the Finnish people.
Big cuts in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different if the Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> government is still able.
The government has set a target for debt collection during this election period, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will take on EUR 5.9 billion more debt next year than this year.
After the convention, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the election year and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own agenda: the debt did not mature or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means new, even more severe cuts in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be at least close to balanced in 2018 and then in the spring it will be accepted in the parliamentary elections.
These actions did not result in debt
It is quite clear that the current measures do not lend themselves, although Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> will try to soften the positive atmosphere.
The rounds presented by the Secretary of State, Martti Hetem<0xC3><0xA4>ki, at the budget briefing, demonstrate this irrevocably:
The global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. no call for aid from the international economy.
Finland’s national economy has not just risen since the 2008 recession, except for the temporary recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent this decade and has increased from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment is now costing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more per year than in 2008.
With Hetem<0xC3><0xA4>ki’s presentation, public debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent over the next half-decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt default presented by the Leftist League was rejected because it was held to be irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will be covered in practice by taking on a completely new debt.
This is the perception of the center, the assembly and the fundamental Finns of what is responsible.
Question: The municipalities want to leave a lot of tasks
Three out of four believe that the organization of child daycare, youth work and exercise is part of the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also blames the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic centres, building supervision, education and waste management.
The responsibility of the county, for its part, is most clearly to be sought by county grants, special medical care, vocational training, vocational colleges and the institution of care for the underdeveloped.
None of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
Underage rider runs behind-the-scenes to run away from police
A 16-year-old motorcycle driver drove a police party in Joensuu on Friday night at half-time.
The police party tried to stop the motorbike running without lights, but the young man went to drive the police away at a fair speed.
The rear-wheel drive continued on Sonkajanranti, from which further on to Sorronahonti and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle was driven out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster policeman ran away to catch the run.
The blast test performed on the driver showed 0.75 promils.
He also didn’t have a driver’s license that would have allowed him to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
There was a truck on the road.
The truck in Kivilast crashed into the yard at Polvij<0xC3><0xA4>rvi Kaavinti on Thursday evening at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left of the map, out of the road, and fell into the lane next to it.
The rescue agency pulled the injured driver away from the wreckage through a door that remained above the wreckage, along with rescue helicopter personnel and first responders.
Lifting the vehicle remained the responsibility of the owner of the car.
A drop of oil flows from the vessel to the hydraulic oil that the rescue facility absorbed into the turmeric.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman went missing in the afternoon.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since noon in Lahdenk<0xC3><0xA4>l<0xC3><0xA4>-Pohjanmaa.
Police are looking for a woman about 165 centimeters long, thin and well-groomed with white hair under her forehead.
Observations and hints about the missing movements are requested to call the Nordic Situation Centre's reference number 0295440513.
Elements of immaturity in the air - see photo gallery about the destruction of Parafest
The fall flow covered the tents of the Parafest Festivals caused considerable destruction.
Arto Pippuri, president of the Parafest Association in Joensuu, estimates that the festival will be financially accessible, and the event will also be held next year.
The last performance of Parafest's Kalle Salonen was performed at the end of Friday night on a tori boat.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances held in the premises of the city theatre from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre in Ahjos has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15 hours.
The program is organized in a planned manner.
Sliding currents are generated in the thunderstorm when your rainwater and its weight trigger a downward airflow.
Changes in the shape of the water of the Ukkosvuva bind to heat, and as a result, the downward air cools and its velocity towards the ground accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the route of shockwaves.
The shockwave hit the back yard of the Art Museum in Joensuu on Friday afternoon before five o’clock.
Three tents fell into a coma, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people slightly hurt themselves.
Among them was one child who was transported slightly injured for follow-up treatment.
Air pollution is getting worse for Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners gets older more quickly than usual.
The reason for the ageing of the skin is air pollution.
The British study is based on the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzed London without the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many elderly people in London is two and a half years older than that of an elderly friend who lives in the countryside.
Small particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution, which is the source of transport fuel.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who are walking on their work trip near crowded streets.
Londoners can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different masks, but regular cleansing of the skin is recommended for a more practical solution.
The brakes of the tractor were deceiving - would snatch in front of the man
The man had moved stones around his yard with a tractor.
When he had got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor brakes slipped and the tractor poured over the man.
The man did not stay under it, but the tractor got a dead man to the extent that he was transported to the central hospital with serious injuries.
The tractor didn't get any more pain, because it hit the stones in front of it.
Retirement with the latest force for the coming period
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship, will start the series in October with better starting points than men’s memories.
The team has been in the box for three weeks now.
The common tone is certainly better than the previous covers, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani S<0xC3><0xA4>is<0xC3><0xA4>, who will continue as head coach of Rienno, is encouraging the new team to be ambitious and united.
In the Rienno, Fred Musoni will start his second term in the third round of the tournament.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who plays for the Rwandan national team, is a 205-cent hooker.
Garchet is a passenger, the Brazilian has a size of 198 cents.
Josban, Kataja and Jokipoki to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every saliband World Cup since 2003.
Now in Tampere there are already six races going, only 2013 was left to Canada to be better in the North American qualifiers.
I was in Turku working and playing with the target women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Saliband national team.
I was interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City, Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen went to Joensuu University to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species was not yet played at SM level as salibandy.
S<0xC3><0xA4>hl<0xC3><0xA4> was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in Jokipoi in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university in the Salibandy SM series for the 1991–92 season, the following three times spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he prepared the A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM series peaked in silver in 1995.
In all, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, earning a total of 169 games 51+34<0x3D>85.
The last season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu V<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>n<0xC3><0xA4>nen were named to the national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu V<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>n<0xC3><0xA4>nen from Joensuu was selected for the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament from 6 to 8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska, who is attacking in Helsinki’s Er<0xC3><0xA4>, has played this before six men’s fielding, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4<0x3D>13.
Tatu V<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>n<0xC3><0xA4>nen, a 32-year-old defender from Wiler-Ersigen, Switzerland, has recovered from the virus and is part of the national team’s standard campaign with 117 field experience.
The national team was also named after Mika Kohonen, the head coach of the Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki Players, who was seen in the Finnish shirt for the last time last December at the World Cup.
The main coach of the Salibandymaa team is Petri Kettunen.
Beach volley sculptor Essi Hasun's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold missing from the prize box
Essi Hasu is going to end as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the season.
The Finnish championships at Beach volley will be decided at the Kouvola Sports Park on weekends.
Over the course of three days, the instruments are played in both adult and young series.
In cooperation with Kouvola Aeroballists and the Finnish Aeroball Association, the SM final tournament will qualify for the top six pairs of each series.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Elim<0xC3><0xA4>ki NMKY raised by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to the games in front of a well-known audience.
Hopefully as many as possible will be able to watch it on the weekend.
I'm sure it's going to be a great arena for the laundry.
I haven’t played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu said.
Kouvola’s combination ignited Hasu’s passion for sports and gave good vibes for great entertainment.
There are many memories of childhood in my mind.
I started flying ball at the age of 9 in the E-girls of Elim<0xC3><0xA4>ki NMKY.
The main thing is in the mind is too big a toy, knee protectors running on the knees, and great screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small town, the sports club had a tight community where everyone knew each other.
The collective spirit of the group created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were heavily involved in the operation - a teammate's father trained us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural choice during the junior season as a counterweight to the indoor ball.
The K<0xC3><0xA4>r<0xC3><0xA4>lammi swimming pool has been playing bees since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to watch the Junior SM Tour competitions myself, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays in the SM finals on weekends with the small-town Anniina Parkkisen.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahten, the goal of the second penalty shootout in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a metric.
SM-gold is still missing from the prize box, Hasu throws it with dignity.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be Hasulle’s last appearance in front of a celebrity audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civil society are expected.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
By the way, the toes are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu designs.
A landslide destroyed tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near
The crash destroyed three tents at the Parafest Festival in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was transported to the hospital for follow-up treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were a total of about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show in a bigger tent.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident occurred on Friday at 5 p.m.
Firefighter Markus Viitaniemi, interviewed by Karjalainen, told the newspaper that there were elements to the accident.
According to the magazine, the continuation of the event is on hold.

Salomon Koli boldly went on to become an agricultural entrepreneur
As an entrepreneurship, agriculture means risk-taking, flexibility and resourcefulness.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, started as an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Koli started the scene two years ago, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, as a continuation of their homestead.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as an agriculturist meant borrowing and increasing the volume so that bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing ever since I was a kid.
I’ve always loved the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I’ve put everything into the game.
If something starts, I think it has to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build pistachios, and at first the bank wasn’t excited about it either.
However, I really bravely went along with the project and have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not believe in producing pure Finnish food and that everything is still going well.
The goal of Salomon Koli, a meat car-growing company, is to invest in an even larger cattle farm.
The work has produced results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
She will be able to vote on the magazine’s website until August 21.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % in July.
This is the highest reading in years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero since last October, when a positive 0,2 % was reported.
The average annual inflation, measured by cost of living indices, was -0.8% over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate was -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the price of the following consumables increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household items and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcohol and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is considered an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has served as a source of inspiration for the filterers, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to edit their reality and identity in playful ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a duck, a dog or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
The lenses are simple, face-twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All false steps will quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat’s lenses have previously been criticized on the grounds that the app advertises a blackface, or “black-eye” mask, or prefers to whiten the skin color as a beauty option.
So when Snapchat this week advertised some users with a lens that gave them squint eyes, squint teeth, and puffy pockets, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."
And they wondered if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company’s greater problem with regard to diversity.
News and abuse spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as an homage to anime characters, not to caricatures of Asians.
But for racist observers, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strongly denied the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison with the side-by-side sharp Asian caricature and filter effects."
It shows that the filter is not only yellow matter, but yellow matter spent in extreme destitution.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that’s outperforming these cultural earnings.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood, and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially more diverse young audience can mean that they’re even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an offending image of a user, “it’s much harder for these guys to be unnoticed.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and in a phone interview, he said he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu mainly criticized the company’s white male leadership and decided to write on the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#DeleteSnapchat)
“They either don’t have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they can make such decisions,” said Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they’re not in positions where they felt safe in their mouth or in their mouth.”
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unresponsive.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss its staff’s racial biases, but a representative said the company hired a recruiter some time ago to focus on underrepresented populations and to carry out internal engagement efforts.
For his part, Zhu said that he keeps his Snapchat account closed, adding: "It's true that they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK."
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Congressional Panel Says Military Officials Misunderstood ISIS Intelligence
In a report published Thursday, the Congressional panel said the U.S. authorities’ intelligence reports on the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces’ war zone were designed to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than what the events on the ground justify.
A report by the Republican Chairman of the House Defence Force Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Sub-Annual Report of the Working Group established by the Defence Sub-Committee found "widespread dissatisfaction" among the lobbyists of the House Intelligence Committee, who received
The headquarters, known as the Centcom, is a prefect of the armed forces in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of the survey, approved by the leaders of the higher-value Centcom, typically gave the United States a more positive picture of counter-terrorism efforts than what the facts on the ground justified. They were more often reported as being more positive than others.
“The events of Centcom are unacceptable – our fighters in the war suffer when poor analyses are presented to high-value decision-makers,” said Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The failures of Centcom management go all the way to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the underlying problems in the descriptions and analyses of the U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that the Obama administration’s high-ranking administration officials had designated reports as thumbnails, it depicts analysts feeling as though Centcom’s leaders had put pressure on them to portray the subject of an Islamic state, the Isis, as the subject of a coup d’état.
“During the first half of 2015, many of the House’s press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
The Centcom authority, for example, has publicly stated that a major attack to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
“After months of investigation, this is very clear,” said Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior intelligence leaders at the U.S. Armed Forces Headquarters in the U.S. military zone manipulated the headquarters’ intelligence outputs to mitigate the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created the task force after hearing that the analysts had raised concerns that intelligence on the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, which was published on Thursday, shows more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Superintendent of the Ministry of Defence has launched an additional ongoing investigation into the investigation of Centcom.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which were consistent with the conclusions of some of the Republican group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessarily isolated process of intelligence assessment by Isis and Iraqi security forces,” Adam B. Schiff, the committee’s lead Democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process “extended the publication of intelligence findings”, gave poor mood among analysts and “did not provide enough room for different perspectives”.
Schiff and the Democrats said they did not find any evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusion to a “pre-set or political narrative.”
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday about the initial results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's superintendent has begun an investigation following complaints from analysts at Centcom.
Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense did not comment on the Congressional report as long as the superintendent’s investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential national security issues."
The investigation also has other repercussions than the question of whether the U.S.-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the growing number of defense agencies now claim).
Last year’s indictments questioned how much President Obama can rely on honest assessments of the war actions of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas to deliver the headquarters.
The criticism of the Islamic State inquiry reflects over a decade ago, when Centcom’s intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote an article in which it was said that despite the objections of several analysts, the coup d’état of President George W. Bush’s administration would be in the grip of the coup d’état
Hooker was also in a key role in the rebellion against Islamic State intelligence.
According to authorities last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite opposing public statements, the expressions against the Islamic State-ruled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group, as it had built temporary refineries to sell crude oil.
The Times reported in September that this finding, however, was not reported outside the main house.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to criticize last year after many lawmakers held his testimony to the Senate as a positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and in his place became the headquarters of General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. wins women's national hockey for the fourth time in a row with Britain
The day after having scored three goals for the team in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam made the first two goals for the U.S. women's national hockey team in a 3-0 win over India on Thursday.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn’t sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a book of his paintings."
But he knows this: The Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, which was still unbeaten after Thursday's win over Japan 2-0.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have survived in the quarter-finals, and this game will decide who will be the first and who will be second in their six-team squad.
First placed to avoid strong Holland, the leader of the second group, at the start of the quarter-finals a little longer.
No matter how Saturday the game ends, the Americans have woken up to their surprise success here, four years after they stayed in the London Olympics for the last 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Pennsylvania's Blue Bell and took his hockey jersey in his hands for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sister played a game at Drexel) in connection with the national team at the age of 16, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He did not participate in the 2008 Summer Olympics because he did not enter his final roster.
In 2012 nothing happened to him and his teammates.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
“Culture change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the same kind of work ethic in London as we do now.
We've made a full translation.
On Thursday evening, Bam started the first half of the first half of the race near the finish line.
India had come into the game with no win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation in the 1-0 readings until the end of the third round, when Bam took over.
He carried the ball to the long left of the field put, then circled in the middle and threw the ball into the goal, taking the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last half of the score to the fourth set.
This zero-game was the tournament's first U.S. goalkeeper for Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the game on Saturday.
Trampoline peace in the middle of the Olympic Winter Games
Wherever you are, whatever the time, the Olympics are on the way.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, angry message of competition and effort.
It’s as if the Olympic Games itself are a glimmering communication cable that is passed from a springboard to a swimmer and a gymnast to a triathlon.
It is impossible to turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to a guest chat in the café without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the Olympic first-time and future heartbreaker with a smile, could very well be one of those familiar names of all who are presented at the best viewing time and supported by sponsorship agreements as well as good-mind TV commercials – if he were a swimmer, a rapist or a man.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing in the Olympic gold trampoline.
The Olympic torch does not illuminate all species as much.
Far from the center, partly in the shade, are those species that are not generally accepted by everyone: the air pistol, the jumper, the volleyball, the taekwondo.
We always have a breast, long live it.
But if I can make a decent number out of my special bouquet, I would like to pay attention to trampoline’s controlled attraction.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its debut in the Sydney Games, its presence has been so little noticed over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed didn’t realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This can be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the genre, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the final until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians usually share the medals of men, the Chinese and the Canadian women.
This year, China’s Dong Dong and Canada’s Rosie McLennan defend their London gold medals.
However, trampoline is associated with a certain attraction of the underdog, in part because it sounds better suited to the clown school than to the Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just a flightless fan.
The species has the possibility of interestingness, as we can see from the color of the endless pumps of cartoons, but it also has the affinity of reinforcement and swimsuit, the two species, which, in principle, are combined.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means "popular board".
With a giant trampoline, the goalie jumps to a height of almost 30 feet, and they have to perform a brisk series of moves (translations, skills and volts) and finally get down on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of performance, difficulty and "time of flight".
There are 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women in Rio.
The most common direction for the Olympics is straight forward.
Those hoping for the medal must go looking for gold longer, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes to the back of the field.
They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in television news, another irritating frontier: the world or the Olympic record.
This determined goal is noble, admirable, and even fanatical - and it can even get the viewer into tears.
But that’s also the reason why even looking at the skirts can be a bit exhausting.
Trampoline provides a rest moment for this.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new rise, acting more weightless than an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
This, of course, does not affect competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no angry rush towards the end, no jumps to the distance, only a dreamy, sweltering interruption of time and gravity.
It is as close to the zen-space as can be reached in the Olympics.
The women's qualifiers and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon at the beginning of the broadcast at 1 pm (ET), the men's races will also be on Saturday at 1 pm.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon program starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic spirit, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not noticed in the general chaos.
And if consciousness is achieved only by offering male heroes to be looked at and presented (as the U.S. male troopers suggested some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for a sobering new talent.
"Sexuality Shows Its Mind" in Ethiopia, which is a long-term ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot to death in clashes with police, police said.
Is Ethiopia collapsing?
During the last decade it has been one of Africa’s most stable states, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, anti-government demonstrations have revived the country as it spread to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was regrettable.
Eyewitnesses said the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters, who were not armed.
The videos, which are believed to be from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how the security authorities are striking young people with their fists while they were forced to stand against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“Keeping this country together has always been difficult, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country gets so much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved tremendously, and the capital Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not, however, been a model of democracy; human rights organisations have been constantly talking about the government's oppression, the country's opposition has been limited, and dissenters have been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
“If you suppress people, and they have no other options but to show their minds, that’s what’s going to happen,” Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
The whole young man shows his mind.
One generation shows its mind.
Complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the torture of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's much-criticised elections, the ruling party with its allies finally got the last place to hold the opposition, and now it holds all the seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the Eritrean border are growing, and the struggle along this tense and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less plunged in recent years, may try to exploit the shelling and re-arm themselves.
A number of factors explain why, after years of dying under the surface, the fragile emotions are now exploding.
The first seems to be the most dangerous of all: smartphones.
In just the last few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during the polls, many people can still communicate via the hidden network’s proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Second, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromos and the Amharas, are better able to deal with each other.
The Oromos and the Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who come mainly from the Christian overlords of Ethiopia, succeeded in politics and business by exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and who live in the subcontinent.
But this too is changing.
“We’re on our way to organizing under one umbrella,” said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Oromo.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos think that Ethiopia is ruled unfairly by its tiger people. The people cover about six per cent of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical nero, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret envoys to make opponents harmless.
“The current administration has no such basic concept,” said conflict analyst Abdi.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up as relatively unknown to fill Meles’ boots.
Unlike Meles, who came from the tiger region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that security services controlled by tigers do not trust him.
Many are afraid that this could lead to an increase in blood flow.
The last time Ethiopia was in the grip of such a landslide was in 2005, when thousands showed their minds about the elections, which analysts say seemed like the government was first shutting down and then stealing them.
In its subsequent performance, many protesters died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for their visionary infrastructure design, such as a new work trip, and for their considerable progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly, this has not stopped the in-country deterioration of the Ethiopian government.
And now it's starting to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked companies owned by tigers, and anti-tiger rage is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the demonstrations will put the United States and other Western allies in a position of restraint.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for flights to neighboring Somalia, even though it said some time ago it closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable ally in the region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "is a real balancing act."
Donald Trump Explains Obama-Focused-Sister Claim to Be 'Sarcasmous'
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his latest campaign by claiming on Friday that he wasn’t serious when he repeatedly said this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have been surfacing to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position where they have to explain remarks that he may not necessarily mean.
Following the suggestion at Wednesday’s campaign meeting, Trump said the same even more eloquently in Thursday’s interviews, in which he felt that his purpose was to say that the president and Clinton were creating Isis.
However, in an early Friday morning tweet, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a complete rendition of the previous day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio critic Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump articulate his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate has taken this to his ears.
The latest wave of criticism comes in a situation where Trump has sought to refocus his campaign amid the results of the economic downturn.
Trump and Clinton were fighting over the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on the subject.
On Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he considered the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense in the past.
In late July, after he faced widespread criticism seemingly suggesting that the Russians should hack into Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, “I’m sure I’m sarcastic.”
The approach allows Trump to go to the limits of political speech and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clarifies' in one direction or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed both candidates' language.
But I also think that he is smart about his opinions and knows that they are vague enough to filter through a number of different lenses.
Instead of easing his speech for the big vote, Trump has been even more cockier in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll published Friday showed that Trump is trailing Clinton significantly in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump tends to avoid apologizing for provocative things to say, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his humor.
As he faces an increasingly close look at the past few months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, saw much trouble defending the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I believe that his words have real, political comments,” Giuliani said when asked about the authenticity of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, which he called amateurs, completely wrong, and that is why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed to deal effectively with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday’s meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media, which will crush him with every word and be biased against him.
He ridiculed the “bad, pathetic” television experts who are trying to make clear of him by saying, “They’re not succeeding!”
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump’s excuse for a new piece of evidence that he was unfit to be president.
Previous PostPrevious Coffee Returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a dull, cash-only place in Williamsburg where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, Bedford Avenue's streetcar was too expensive for it.
The movement that replaced Verbi in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals lamented it as the last loss in a middle-class renovating city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is a mess and Verb is a soap shop today.”
But if New York is a change, it is also a reinvention.
The Revived Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff is still the same and there is the same uncluttered atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started at Verbi in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him in a new location, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, had a lot of things going on.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it, too.
He brought new ingredients.
On the dining table you will find bacon-orange cheese sandwiches, and on the decks are available, for example, caprices and browned onions.
There's brown rice in the balls.
The café no longer serves beer, but fresh juices are made there.
During nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old-time clients.
“Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers as well,” he said.
One of the last Sundays Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he walked into his cafe.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up the coffee truck for a moment.
“I understood that I enjoyed Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although on that day he ordered a mixed tea drink instead of his regular iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been visiting Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went there before work and always made the same order.
“Every day at fifteen over seven, regularly like an hour, I went in and they were making my spice bagel with butter,” he said.
Rodriguez said that he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes due to the fluctuation he places a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't wear a good suit to a soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special Verbille teapot, which would be used as an ingredient in the café’s cold brewed coffee.
"I think we can still take on the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers turned from food to drink, and Rodriguez said that he plans to put it on the table soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juicer wants to bottle and sell cold-pressed coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand to the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough that they get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a customer and said it was uncomfortable when the place was closed.
When a new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt as if he had come home walking in and ordering coffee.
"I wish I could smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Delicious Food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office room.
As a courtesy, President Roosevelt considered the refined foods of Fifth Avenue, such as bean paste, and Maryland's soot diet.
On that day, his diet was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes, and a dessert from the creamy young.
“It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans on how to eat.”
The couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, told of Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life on the Lower East Side plateau through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the great depression of the 1930s.
By showing their own culinary solidarity, they meet the supplier at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unpretentious lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been operating since the 1929 stock market boom.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese-olive shake, and Coe, 57, took a dose of turkey, potato seed and vegetables.
When the supplier ordered meat carcasses, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the carcass.
"The concerns were very popular," Ziegelman said.
It was peanut butter, liver butter, papaya butter.
They were made of a preparation substance and some low-cost ingredient that continued with the actual preparation substance.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would make up for your dinner.
Coe irvisti.
"It's certainly felt in the stomach from a lead wound," he said.
In the years before the collapse of the American tables, especially in the countryside, there was like a eat-in-so-much-as-a-time knockout table.
Women’s groups provided food for male farm workers, and fresh slices were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Americans sent food to the Europeans who were hungry during World War I. The book A Square Meal chronicled the ways in which the nation survived from the fact that it was no longer a land of abundance.
“Then food became a central, distressing topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, inexpensive diet: Mystery dishes, such as pancakes and boxes, became the main dishes, and the box was a "major way to use food starches," Ziegelman mentioned, as chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients from a layer of cream.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which had been in the center of American affairs for years, became a low-cost luxury product.
Special compositions were tested when the amount of calories and nutrient content were more important than the taste or even the common sense in the kitchen.
In doing research, Ziegelman also prepared an age-old dish for a book containing recipes, in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to his dinner table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
Butterflies are not suitable for roasted onions.
This was typical for many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Bureau of Households from 1923 to 1943, directed the country’s food practices more than ever before or since.
In public recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they would encourage women to start “budgeting” and to respond to the challenge of converting spaghetti and carrot-like mushrooms into tasty doses.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic flavors.
Especially tasty are reports of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's letting me eat cake.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his childhood with simple, juicy peasant food, he ate like a fine millionaire who had come from him.
"He liked continental food, like fish with a cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in an almost gold-plated dining room.
He was great outside of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an economist who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that “provided not only the poorest of Washington, but also the worst-prepared food.”
Many of the Lamanian diets were abandoned as soon as the earth got back on its feet.
As a legacy, we have an ongoing focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and on the way science is applied to the diet.
The couple said that by writing a book, they had a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s diet, for example, of how she was unable to throw food away.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even sickened people."
There was a wind-blown accident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe drew up the dessert they had prepared at home: the crusty dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called a creamy fragrance," Ziegelman said, adding that the general trick was to give the modest recipes a name.
There was no cream cheese in the dessert, only creams, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
They all unwittingly dipped their spoon into a sticky, brown list.
Surprised it wasn't bad.
Coe once and for all.
Sounds like a positive budgeter, he told his wife: “A little bit of ridiculed German nuts could help.”
Gilead Reimbursement of Lawyer Costs in Hepatitis C Patent Fight Against Merck
The U.S. District Court has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to attorney fees incurred by it in its complaint against the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc. for hepatitis C patient.
In June, Gilead was freed from $200 million in payments after they violated two of Merck's patents relating to Gilead's successful drugs in Sovald and Harvon. This release followed when a U.S. judge found Merck's misdeeds, including the one that was falsely implicated in the conspiracy.
In a court ruling on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to free itself from the damages caused by its opposition to the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which rules the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can clearly cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The trial dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other over the ownership of the laboratory work under the active substance sofosbuvir, the drug.
U.S.-backed forces say they have completely conquered ISIS-controlled Manbij
U.S.-backed forces have seized control entirely near the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, the group's representative said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now exploring the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The forces had released more than 2,000 helicopters held captive by fighters from the Sharfan Darwish SDF Allies, Manbij's Military Council, told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it,” he told Reuters.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2% of federal taxes.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and his wife’s income in that year was $10.75 million, and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former Secretary of State announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in a letter to the Clinton Foundation.
Clinton’s vice president-elect, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, released a 10-year tax return.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the benchmark for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises to release his tax returns.
By the way, U.S. presidential candidates will publish their tax returns, even if the law does not oblige them.
New York businessman Trump’s attorney has appealed to the tax administration for an audit on the grounds that tax returns have been refused.
"Your turn," Clinton campaigner Ian Sams said on Twitter, posting a link to the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump’s special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the accounts are ready.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his ties to other businesses, and the number of others.
Clinton has been caught up in the problem in a web video released on Friday that featured prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his tax.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done in the last few decades: you’ve published his tax returns,” he told the audience.
Politico has stated that Trump hasn’t paid any or very little taxes in the two of the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist on Friday borrowed a number of tax collectors and accountants who said the situation might still be the same.
The federal tax rate has become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has backed billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s so-called rule, which would ensure that more than a million dollars a year earned would pay at least 30 percent of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Nebraska’s Omaha last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also has an ongoing tax administration audit, and that Trump is not “afraid” of the tax collection agency, but voters.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate for Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, as opposed to the majority of Americans.
Their primary investment target was an affordable, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton announced $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and ultrasound enhance Tanzania's protection of elephants
Naturalists in Tanzania are using an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human institutional areas - they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proved effective, and the idea of the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, invented several years ago, has made its advertising more effective by training volunteers in the North Tanzanian village to use the non-violent four-step approach to sheltering the home.
In the past, many people used jewelry to protect themselves.
Friday is a global day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since we developed...tools, we’ve seen a change of attitude in these communities, and we’re much more confident now that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said Damian Bell, chief operating officer of Honeygoods.
The first two steps include the insertion of an intrusive elephant with a flashlight and the playing of a bull.
If it does not prevent the animal, the so-called "chili cloud" is thrown out.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil as well as a beam, after which the condom is rotated so that only the ignition wire remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts into flames and sprays chili powder into the air.
One scent is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
The last option is the trigger that shoots into the air of a Roman candle. The fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish Filmmaker Criticizes Hotel in Berlin That Removed Israel’s Directional Number at Arab Request
A French, Jewish-American filmmaker released a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel’s address number. According to the employee, this is due to the “requests” of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made a documentary about the Holocaust, dismissed his disillusionment with the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find a list of directions for hotels in Israel.
However, the country is not mentioned among those countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and looted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call centre.
While searching for an explanation, the filmmaker addressed the matter at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer from there "surprised him".
The hotel receptionist said it was a "considered decision of Kempinski hotel management".
The reason behind the decision caused even more turbulence in the filmmaking.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel’s address number,” Lanzmann said.
Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, calls the case a “great injustice,” reports the Zuddeutsche Zeitung.
“We were terrified and shocked by the incident.
It is already a great injustice in itself.
But even more shameful is the fact that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident caused quite a backlash online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "refused" to the claimed demands of Arab customers.
"Wake up," said another publication, which noted that the hotel, located on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street, stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called the incident "inattention" and "sorry" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
“A clear order to not include Israel in the shortlist has never been made,” Kempinski’s representative said in a statement.
It adds that the trend number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students who thought they were showing their minds.
The students met with police in the Brazilian city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo on Thursday, as students gathered to express their opinion against the government’s public education system reforms.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Problems began when law enforcement officers tried to break up a student squad, which led to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their horror plans.
According to Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, the governor of Sao Paulo, public schools would be closed to just under 100, and 300,000 students would be re-placed to save money.
Some of the participants were seen writing graffiti against the walls of interim President Michel Temer.
This last comment came just days after the protesters left as a group to support President Dilma Rousseff, who had been detained in the country’s Senate by voting in his office.
RT Business: Russian-Iranian trade surges 71%
After the lifting of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan said.
After international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in the country’s business, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue to bind their existing ties to Iran, while the new companies are ready to enter the market.
“Naturally, one of the most important objectives of Iran’s bilateral cooperation is the expansion of trade,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period of 2015 totalling $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose by 91.5 per cent to a total of $697 million.
Russia’s imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
"The growth of trade was achieved by the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Ministry in Iran granted Iranian citizens about 35,000 visas mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries with the most tourists in Russia for the first time.
"It seems safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scooter Callum Skinner kicked into goal with British snatch of cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner was honored at the men's team sprint at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night when the three of the UK team defended their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchor in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy, a legend of a youthful pride as he snuck into the goal by striking a win-win for the New Zealand team.
Britain took a shock win four years ago, while Hoy won his fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after placing modestly sixth in March at the World Championships in London, even though Hoy has since decided to race.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of special envoy Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoy's termination also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man that the British coaches were holding on to in Scotland the potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner made the Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a two-fight gold.
Hindes was left behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team to lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and it included the Hindes' drive on a larger scale to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to hold on to the knots.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, and caught the attention of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they stepped into the awards ladder.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow, Skinner, said, “The comparison is flattering.”
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We made the Olympic record in the final and won the World Championships.
It was incredible at the same time.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012, alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later retracted his comments, and the UK's competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "It felt like I was in London when there were so many British flags on the platform."
As a team, we found a connection during the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of a total of ten cycling styles in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the evolution of the last five months, we expect a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny’s condition, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s feat, winning three Olympic golds in one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (which is apparently a sacred day in British sport, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister’s birthday) – the total number of medals would rise to six in gold and six in gold.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will compete in the next sprint, which starts today and lasts for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I just enjoyed this one.
Team competition is always the best.
You can win it with your friends.
Winning alone is, frankly, lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of a knight."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were at times the fastest four-person, four-kilometre team race.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London, the world record for winning gold in 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will surely be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before time runs, when officials called him for a length measurement.
In a similar women’s competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald advanced in the world record time at 4:13:260.
The UK team has learned to trust that its great cycling team will take over the Olympic midfield and reach the full range of medals.
Presented in Beijing and London for a truly exceptional and complete management, expectations have been reduced before Rio’s elections.
There has been a drama on the back, the least of which has not been a technical leader, Shane Sutton, the difference in April over allegations of sexism and harassment, as well as the end of the competition for big figures such as Hoyn and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night’s competition at the cycling stadium, it seems that the legendary reputation of the UK now rising to its peak at the perfect moment could once again be held right.
The future of the Portland meltdown is questionable due to the cut-off of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland-Victorian aluminium complex, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when a power company distributing electricity to the plant revealed that one of the factory’s owners is concluding a distribution agreement, so all distribution contracts are expected to be cut.
The measure follows the decision of the Victorian Government earlier this year that the support required for the operation of the plant will not continue.
The 20-year fixed-term aid will end in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2000 jobs can be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as melting consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's dam, which led to the closure of the force in England last year.
Alcoa Portland's meltdown is losing money, and it's under lockdown.
The measure is now following years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the factory's production price.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium plant in Latrobe Valley, Loy Yang An, said it is also waiting for three other owners to conclude their contract.
The majority of the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operations, which means that the physical electricity demand for the melt will continue,” it said.
According to the AGL, the agreements are the so-called "security agreements", which were to come into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“For this reason, AGL expects the results of the contracts to be produced in the financial year 2017,” the company said.
All possible impact on AGL’s performance from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently limited by the strong outlook of the electricity wholesale futures market.
The AGL said it has already “decided on forecasts” reduced the value of the contracts in its accounting by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep melting in operation or to secure the melting power supply".
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the deal was due to come into effect in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been alerted to both the Portland Dam in Victoria and the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, as the sector’s economic situation is poor.
Earlier this week, AGL Chief Operating Officer Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and about 900 megawatts of Tomago annually.
"If both plants leave the market, this is a significant reduction in [electricity] market demand.
For us as an electrician, this would not be a good thing,” he said.
Kendall, not just a true Kardashian TV star, is on the cover of Vogue in September
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's clan, is on the cover of the US Vogue's desired September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and model at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
“Looking at this blanket in a room full of loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a special (or maybe just a Kardashian style suit?), a handwritten reality video featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases of Rob and Caitlyn, and associated with everyone’s favorite cartoon, Keeping Up with the Rabbit Producer Rinse.
This is almost every children's TV show's "birthday season" cliché strip pattern (Seacrest says the quotes "we probably thought we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning-drawn pujus), but Krisin had to get his other girls to somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved into the new Kardashian era with the location of Vogue in September.
Kendall’s older sister Kim may have taken Vogue’s case first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is entirely her own.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
Its thickness resembles more of a coffee table than a form sheet, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion estimated that 615 of last year’s 832 page tutorials had advertising content).
The publication of this publication is expected to be so eagerly awaited that for the last two years images of the newspaper have leaked before the official publication.
Former women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "publics that act as models" than "models that are famous".
Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it were to happen that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as his generation's "success model", would first hit the mentioned category, he's pretty good at it.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or today’s young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly gifted women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year’s cover model Beyoncé has been one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
With her true TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be supportive.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and this colleague Gigi Hadid calling them "the grandmother of this moment".
This feeling once again surfaced with Jenner’s Vogue cover.
But in dissatisfaction, spinning is unheard of.
Kendall Jenner is Vogue's number one pick in September.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup.
He and all his sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own, behind the paywall in their apps.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she took to LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and his children, he's a real TV star.
The Community's legal centres attract 160,000 people every year.
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are displaced annually from the Community's legal centres as the sector prepares itself for the effects of additional financial cuts on its already completed activities at the border.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, the immigrants, the injured workers, the victims of violence, those who do not have the opportunity to fight unfair marriages and the like - are already being turned away in their search for a free trial and a fair trial.
The legal services already extended to the frontiers of the Community are being prepared for further cuts.
In June of this year, these legal centres will lose 30 per cent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres report said that thousands of people are being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
“The legal centers of the Queensland community are chronically underfunded, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with unmanageable and crippling debts, families in the housing gap, unduly segregated workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The federal government cuts funding by 30 percent in June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected Queenslanders will be forced to navigate the midst of complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to the Minister of Justice and to the Queensland Senator George Brandi that they immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government implemented its promise to raise the financing of legal aid to the national average level.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and its customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged in court after a worker was alleged to have been armed with a threatened weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged in court for allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the campaign’s chief of staff threatened a worker with a weapon in February while they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in a complaint filed by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordin in Charlotte on Wednesday in the state court.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that "it would not happen".
Chief Earl Phillip "put out a gun, put his right front finger on the mover, and pushed the pipe against Vincent's knee," Bordini said in the complaint.
After being selected for local and regional campaign management, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, the complaint said.
“You don’t have to fire things to cause harm,” Bordini said in a statement.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a stir when he told the public in North Carolina that "the people of the second addition" - which usually includes gun owners and gunmen - could take action on the choice of a picket fence, if his pitch were to hit the hill.
Trump’s campaign said that the media has taken his word out of context, and that he does not support violence.
Bordin’s challenge is to seek compensation from the campaign for reckless surveillance and from Phillip for violence, abuse and emotional disturbance.
Trump’s representative, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip failed to do so.
WCCB, the local news agency Charlotse, reported Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call request made to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
The campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.
The trial is against Bordini Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand from Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishing to the entire country, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was a great attraction for Heathrow, just as it was also the attraction for London 2012 races, when we saw tremendous effort to make sure that all our people and our region benefited from the races.
The Olympians had huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only local communities will be able to create 10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs, as well as to eliminate youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London games, some will come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the elections and that we would be ashamed in front of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they are going to be wrong about Heathrow.
Obstacles can always be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just for the few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and on a budget: from the T5, which has been voted the world’s best airport terminal for five consecutive years, to the T2, which was built on the world’s two busiest hubs.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, which is supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private money.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for the United Kingdom, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure our trading future, and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Heathrow Board and the former Secretary of Commerce of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse games to prevent ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, businesses bypassing the ad-blocking program are “in-the-mice and mouse-playing,” said one of the companies making such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent ad blockers from using its computer pages, Adblock Plus released a blog post saying that users could update the program’s filters to again prevent ads from appearing on the social networking site.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website’s code will be changed around ads so that ad blockers are more difficult to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's been spinning a new code.
In a blog post, Adblock’s representative Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back-to-back struggle between the community and its tour operators that prevents open source ads has been going on since the ad blocking was invented,” and that it is possible that Facebook will invent its own hack.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much sadness about the ad blockers has become to the industry.
Globally, around 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which is nearly four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook’s ad impressions.
However, the company is behind the page ad blockers on the computer, as mobile ad blockers don’t work on Facebook’s mobile apps on social networks or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer ads are still bringing in enough revenue to make Facebook consider such an action to be worth the investment.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “ads-like” tool to give people more power over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were alarming, as they would also prevent some of the site’s other than advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we are planning to tackle the problem," a Facebook representative said in an email statement.
The ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman Left Under Car On Swiss Motorway Apparently For Suicide <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for eye-witnesses after a woman was left on the highway under several traffic lights on Thursday in the early hours of the incident, which was apparently suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "desperate act" and sat in the dark sleeping on the road, where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers related to the incident have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, said the police, who are appealing to them and all eyewitnesses who have confirmed the incident.
The criminal investigation has begun, which is a “logical” step in this kind of situation, attorney Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved are being charged.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains to be resolved by the prosecutor," Hofstetter said.
In the last five years, two similar cases indicate that drivers are not held liable.
In both cases - in which both were a person walking on a dark highway - it was estimated that the drivers could not wait to meet the pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, police were released on charges of negligence in the aftermath of the death of a man who was lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had walked down the street, the court was told.
The court found that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, were driving in a reasoned manner, and that the man's whereabouts on the road were "completely exceptional and unpredictable," the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was likely once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to study the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out if Venus's heating, waterproofing of the surface and carbon dioxide filling of the atmosphere could at one time have been earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotational speed of Venus explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have been spinning slowly.
The model also examined the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had the driest regions of the Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to make life possible and quickly protect it from water evaporating.
The advantage of early Venus was also 30 percent lighter than the sun.
“In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun in the middle of the day for almost two months at a time,” said GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick cloud layer that acts as a rain cover, protecting the surface from the heat of the sun for the most part.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth’s current ones.
The model produced a story about the phases of the evolution of Venus, which is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was probably once habitable, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in the ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, there was only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere left with a deadly greenhouse gas atmosphere - Venus, which we now know.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanche coach's job
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the actions of Colorado Avalanche coach and ice hockey vice-chairman, saying he was the reason for the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, Colorado’s deputy chief executive officer, confirmed the information and said the team will immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have been serving as Colorado Avalanche’s deputy ice hockey manager and head coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I’ve been thinking for a long time and boldly about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the view of the coach and the deputy head of ice hockey must be fully in line with the view of the organization.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for this contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today of his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the league's Jack Adams Award for Best Coach in the first Avalanche season of 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the Central Division win, but Minnesota fell to Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not been able to continue for the last two years.
Avalanche's games in 2015-16 ended in 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing a wild card to the West Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and delay the strike in the country.
The labor struggles of the North Sea oil workers for wages are delayed when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
The oilfield service company against Wood Group has been randomly organized by the drilling rigs of the North Sea led by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process to resolve the current dispute,” the joint statement read.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week, so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent anti-labour action, which they claim to be the first in more than 25 years, was an objection to possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut the wages of North Sea contractors by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company’s remuneration follows a 10% reduction in the number of contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the necessary mobility space to cope with the downward trend in the market.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people from its payrolls and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company eases operations as a result of its giant merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with the Allies earlier this week to discuss one of the largest working conflicts in the North Sea for a generation.
He said the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
“We need an economy that works for many, not just for the few, both in the North Sea and across the country,” he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average value of the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiadian constellation
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to gather a more complete list of the rotational speeds of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data will help astronomers to understand why the stars in the cluster are spinning at varying speeds, and how orbiting times are related to planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass, its age, and even the history of the solar system,” Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Pasadena Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at Caltech, said in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars of the group have been born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now spinning at their highest level.
At its peak rotation speed, these adult stars are collapsing in large numbers from the stellar wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they slow down the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the appearance of recognizable starspots, such as sunspots.
The list of the most recent stellar rotational speeds suggests that the more massive stars rotate slower than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, whose larger ones make the pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
“In the Pleiadian ‘ballet’ we see that slow wheels are usually more massive, while the fastest wheels are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Pleiadian star cluster is so close, it is the ideal space laboratory for evaluating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
“The Pleiadian star cluster provides an anchor for the rotating theoretical models of stars that include both directions, younger and older,” Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, why and why stars slow down their rotational speed and so-called hang their 'dance shoe' on their fingernails.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Pleiadian rotational speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
